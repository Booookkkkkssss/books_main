      "When I first heard about this book, I fell in love with the cover and the fact that it was focused on being tropical. While I haven’t seen Millie Marotta’s first coloring book – Animal Kingdom, I thought this one would do a wonderful job showing off some beautiful tropical artwork.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There are lots of animals (frogs, birds, big cats, etc), trees, and lots of flowers to choose from. There are even some pages in the book with directions to help add your own artwork to the book – such as creating some flowers for a bird nest in order to make it more homey. While I’m not much for drawing, I can see how these pages would definitely appeal to those who are good at it and enjoy it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the designs are pretty simple, flower-y designs, and some of them are much more intricate and time-consuming. In fact, a lot of the designs in this beautiful book are very detailed, and you would need very sharp pencils to get to a lot of these areas. I have only tried out colored pencils in this book so far, and since the illustrations are printed on both sides, I’m not sure how well markers or gel pens would work out. Either way, colored pencils definitely do a nice job when coloring these pictures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper in this coloring book is pretty thick, so you can add a lot of layers of color (at least with pencils) without worrying about ruining other pictures, and the pages are a nice bright white, so you can make these images pop with all kinds of color combinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only issue I have with this book is how a lot of the illustrations span two pages, and it can be difficult to add color close to the spine. Even on the single page illustrations, I had a bit of a difficult time fully coloring the images because of this, but it isn’t enough to ruin the awesome coloring experience that this book brings.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest takeaway from this was that so many of the First Ladies had tragic lives. Many of them were upset and cried when their husbands became president. A lot of them had to endure a bunch of bad stuff (absent husbands, children dying, health problems, long travels, etc.) to help their husbands get to the White House. I had no idea that this was the reality for a majority of them. Their lives were not as glamorous as some may have thought.\n",

      "Hardly anyone ever talks about the First Ladies (especially the earlier ones) so it was really insightful to learn more about them. They deserve more recognition than they get.\n",

Instead, I found myself rereading my favorite wives or referencing them in conversation. The short excerpts are perfect for a shorter attention span (or a bathroom reader, lol). All the extra insider details read like that favorite history teacher who gave you all the real scoop.\n",

Leaving and coming back to the stories presents no hardship in how they are processed.\n",

      "\n",
      "I found I especially liked Mary Todd Lincoln (who doesn't?), Lou Henry Hoover (a geologist), Lady Bird Johnson (with such a bossy husband), Laura Bush (who knew she smoked until the 1990s?), as well as Abigail Fillmore (started a library at the White House) and Florence Harding (wife of the most corrupt president...though this title could be questioned today, perhaps).\n",
      "\n",
      "What did the best of these First Ladies have in common? Ambitious for their husbands. Very bright. Right hand man of the president. Able to overlook flaws of the presidents and focus on their strengths. Multi-taskers. A strong sense of what was right.\n",

      "This was different than the stories you get of presidents. This is from the woman side, you find out that a lot of will-be presidents married up for money or prestige. I’m sure love too. There were a lot of first ladies that didn’t want their husband going to the White House. There are more first ladies more troubled than you’ll believe but there are more ladies more talented than we ever knew. The women in the book were more interesting than their husbands.\n",
      "Jason Rekulak was an editor of this book. He wrote a fantastic book called “Impossible Fortress.”\n",
