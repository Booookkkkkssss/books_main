      "Check out this and other reviews on my young adult book blog, Here's to Happy Endings!\n",
      "\n",
      "When I first heard about this book, I fell in love with the cover and the fact that it was focused on being tropical. While I haven’t seen Millie Marotta’s first coloring book – Animal Kingdom, I thought this one would do a wonderful job showing off some beautiful tropical artwork.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There are lots of animals (frogs, birds, big cats, etc), trees, and lots of flowers to choose from. There are even some pages in the book with directions to help add your own artwork to the book – such as creating some flowers for a bird nest in order to make it more homey. While I’m not much for drawing, I can see how these pages would definitely appeal to those who are good at it and enjoy it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the designs are pretty simple, flower-y designs, and some of them are much more intricate and time-consuming. In fact, a lot of the designs in this beautiful book are very detailed, and you would need very sharp pencils to get to a lot of these areas. I have only tried out colored pencils in this book so far, and since the illustrations are printed on both sides, I’m not sure how well markers or gel pens would work out. Either way, colored pencils definitely do a nice job when coloring these pictures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper in this coloring book is pretty thick, so you can add a lot of layers of color (at least with pencils) without worrying about ruining other pictures, and the pages are a nice bright white, so you can make these images pop with all kinds of color combinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only issue I have with this book is how a lot of the illustrations span two pages, and it can be difficult to add color close to the spine. Even on the single page illustrations, I had a bit of a difficult time fully coloring the images because of this, but it isn’t enough to ruin the awesome coloring experience that this book brings.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has a lot of variety – animals, flowers, plants, tropical designs, etc., and the illustrations are all so beautiful!\n",

      "I received this book for free from the publisher (Quirk Books) in exchange for an honest review.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved this book! I love history, especially when it comes to topics that are not talked about much. So naturally, this book was right up on my alley.\n",
      "\n",
      "This edition of the book features profiles of all the First Ladies, including the most recent one, Melania Trump. It gives a short biography about each First Lady and her time in the White House, as well as some fun facts and stories. There are also some fun illustrations (which I loved).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest takeaway from this was that so many of the First Ladies had tragic lives. Many of them were upset and cried when their husbands became president. A lot of them had to endure a bunch of bad stuff (absent husbands, children dying, health problems, long travels, etc.) to help their husbands get to the White House. I had no idea that this was the reality for a majority of them. Their lives were not as glamorous as some may have thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly anyone ever talks about the First Ladies (especially the earlier ones) so it was really insightful to learn more about them. They deserve more recognition than they get.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, if you want a fun little history lesson on the First Ladies, then look no further, this book is for you!\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I'm giving this a five star since I'd really only thought this would end up being a good bathroom reader, if you know what I mean. Instead, I found myself rereading my favorite wives or referencing them in conversation. The short excerpts are perfect for a shorter attention span (or a bathroom reader, lol). All the extra insider details read like that favorite history teacher who gave you all the real scoop.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "There isn't so much plot in this book as there is anecdote - and yet it still manages to capture attention and flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance - Martha Washington might have been involved in the death of her first husband's half-brother? It's just not the picture I had in my mind of our first First Lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "And being as Grover Cleveland wasn't particularly prominent in my childhood education, I hadn't heard the details of his White House marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really, Grover? Your former ward? The daughter of your best friend? Proof that there were People of Wal Mart long before there was Wal Mart.\n",

      "is not a story, but a series of vignettes taking a gossipy look at the lives of the women behind the men leading the nation, it can be read in short bursts while waiting for kids at sports practices, at doctor's offices, or while waiting for the slow wheels of bureaucracy to... do anything. Leaving and coming back to the stories presents no hardship in how they are processed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Cormac O'Brien writes up gossip better than the Daily Mail, so the entertainment promised is delivered with exponents tacked onto the end. Delivered so well, in fact, that I immediately bought his .\n",
      "\n",
      "On a final note, I had no idea that Martin Van Buren neglected to even mention his wife in his memoirs. What a jerk.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Well, that was fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "My f-t-f book club is reading the lives of First Ladies, each participant picking one and reading about her, but, of course, I couldn't do that, so instead I decided to read about all of them (up to 2005, anyway, the book's copyright date).\n",
      "\n",
      "I found I especially liked Mary Todd Lincoln (who doesn't?), Lou Henry Hoover (a geologist), Lady Bird Johnson (with such a bossy husband), Laura Bush (who knew she smoked until the 1990s?), as well as Abigail Fillmore (started a library at the White House) and Florence Harding (wife of the most corrupt president...though this title could be questioned today, perhaps).\n",
      "\n",
      "What did the best of these First Ladies have in common? Ambitious for their husbands. Very bright. Right hand man of the president. Able to overlook flaws of the presidents and focus on their strengths. Multi-taskers. A strong sense of what was right.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fun read. I may look for more of this series from Quirk Books.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This was different than the stories you get of presidents. This is from the woman side, you find out that a lot of will-be presidents married up for money or prestige. I’m sure love too. There were a lot of first ladies that didn’t want their husband going to the White House. There are more first ladies more troubled than you’ll believe but there are more ladies more talented than we ever knew. The women in the book were more interesting than their husbands.\n",
      "Jason Rekulak was an editor of this book. He wrote a fantastic book called “Impossible Fortress.”\n",

      "This is not a who done it, because you know who done it: Father Zach's so-called friend, Bishop Peter, transferred a priest with history of pedophilia to a poor parish and let the chips fall where they will. And fall, they did. Why? Because that's the way it's always been done. Protect the institution, and silence the victims. Problem: the offender ended up murdered by Migo, a young man he abused. In Riker's Island, Migo is befriended by Father Zach who is having his own problems as a gay priest ordered to keep quiet about it. But he can't keep quiet about Migo, once he knows that it was Peter who put him in harm's way.\n",

      "It's a tough one! The courtroom drama at the end will keep you on the edge of your seat. Those goshawful New York tabloids go wild!\n",

But, the Church is not one person, Francis is going to need people to work along with him to accomplish his dreams. Pray that he survives long enough to accomplish the much needed resurrection in the Church.\n",

      "Very good book, second chance story with a mystery going along with it. This isn't really a stand alone story as the first book, A Brother's Honor, should be read first to get the full story. The main focus in this book is Caden, the middle brother, and his relationship with Shiloh. Caden and Shiloh had been friends as kids, until Caden's mother was murdered and his father imprisoned for it. Shiloh's parents forbid her from seeing him again. They renewed their friendship after they were grown and away from home, where it grew into a deep love for each other. Their plans to elope were interfered with, leaving Caden feeling betrayed and Shiloh wondering what happened. Four years later Caden finally learns the truth and is determined to win back Shiloh's love and trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caden came across as a bit of a jerk at the beginning. His attitude toward Shiloh when she came to him with what she discovered about their aborted wedding was really bad. I got that he was hurt by what he saw as her betrayal, but considering the source of the information he should have investigated more. I liked the way that he realized how badly he had screwed up once he did have the truth and knew it was going to be a struggle to win Shiloh back. Shiloh had suffered from her heartbreak for a long time, and after the latest confrontation with Caden had finally decided it was time to move on. Having him show up and admit he was wrong was satisfying for her, but she wasn't so sure she wanted to risk her heart again. I enjoyed Caden's persistence and Shiloh's attempts to resist. A near death experience for Caden showed Shiloh that her love for him hadn't died and being together was more important than hanging on to her hurt. Their relationship continues to grow as they deal with questions of who might be trying to kill him and the ongoing puzzle of who was really responsible for his mother's murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the story are more clues showing that Shep Granger is indeed innocent of his wife's murders. He may be stuck in prison, but he is still receiving threats against his family if anyone tries to prove him innocent. I love seeing how he has made use of his time in prison and the influence he has had on the lives of others. That influence ends up helping him protect his family, even from behind bars. I also enjoyed seeing his relationship with his lawyer and look forward to more of it in the next book. The clues we get about the murder lead to the idea that there was more to it than a lover's quarrel. The last chapter contains a twist that I really didn't see coming and will be very interested in seeing what comes of it in the next book.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also some good parts dealing with the ongoing relationship between Jace and Shana. I loved seeing the way that Jace's happiness is an example for his two brothers, even though they may not always appreciate it. They are still dealing with some of the fallout from the corporate spying in the first book and a suspected murder has them thinking that their troubles aren't over yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shana's dad also has a continuing storyline with his new lady friend. I loved his conviction that her blindness doesn't matter. I really liked his conversation with his daughter about his feelings for her late mother and the difference in his feelings now.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most enjoyable parts of the book is Dalton's search for the woman that he met in a bar one night. Dalton is the brother who is the biggest player of them all. He's never had to work for a woman's attention and it seems to have gone to his head. When he tracks down the mystery lady he's surprised when she wants nothing to do with him. He has an even bigger surprise in store when he finds out who she is. His book should be very interesting.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I thoroughly enjoyed this book, hence the 5 out of 5 rating. It is the second book in a series, but it contains enough details so that you'll know what's going on and get caught up in the story. There's a romance, naturally, and an ongoing mystery that continues through the series. I highly recommend. Kudos Ms. Jackson!\n",

      "I loved it and found it a continuation of the first series...'A Brother's Honor.' I would definitely suggest you read the first series to truly understand what is going on in the second series. \"A Man's Promise\" was mainly of Caden Granger and Shiloh Timmons love story and it was a real interesting one that will bring to us 'lies, misunderstandings, secrets hurt and betrayal.' Now add some mystery, suspense, romance, drama and conspiracy into all of that and you have one amazing story that just keep on going into the next series. ..Dalton's story. I don't want to give too much away just know that the Granger brothers...Jace, Caden and Dalton will give you a such a intensed read from start to finish. By picking up 'A Man's Promise' you will find that this author has done a excellent job giving us a well written novel from start to finish with all of its twist and turns. The characters were all simply off the chart ...well wait a moment...their were a few to shake you head at...but mostly all were well developed, well portrayed, colorful and so believable only helping to give the reader a well attention grabber and oh yes I loved that ending...a cliffhanger. This was very well done. The only thing left to say is I will be waiting for the next series.. about Dalton and I am sure there will be even more for us... unlocking and tying it all together in this who, what, when and why of it all in this last series.\n",

      "This is a (very loose) retelling of Cinderella in a historical romance format.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronwyn is a minor Scottish lady. She, her eccentric inventor father, her stepmother, and her two younger stepsisters are living in genteel poverty - able to keep on a servant and a cook, but sometimes unable to afford firewood or the ingredients for apple tarts. Sense and Sensibility-like.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, Bronwyn is reading in the forest with her two wolfhounds, Walter and Scott. A huntsman chasing a small fluffy white dog bursts into the clearing. He is Alexsey. He is an arrogant jerk. In this opening scene, he snatches away a book she's been reading, reads a few passages out loud, and declares its kissing descriptions to be bunk. When Bronwyn protests, he states that she must know nothing about kissing, and starts kissing her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was like, \"Excuse me. You just met this woman. You don't know her. She doesn't know you. You guys are alone in an isolated part of the forest. She didn't flirt with you or make any sign that she wanted to be kissed by you. You do not have a right to touch her. Back the fuck off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She runs off, leaving a shoe behind, which Alexsey keeps. He thinks she is a servant girl and is excited at the thought of having an affair with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 40 pages later, there is a ball. Bronwyn, who at 24 is considered \"on the shelf,\" attends as a chaperone for her two younger sisters. There she is surprised to learn that the huntsman who kissed her in the forest is really a half-fake-Russian-speaking country/half-Gypsy prince. And he is surprised and dismayed to find that she is a minor lady. That will make his seduction of her all the more difficult. Her mother immediately starts pushing her gorgeous middle daughter, Sorcha, at the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the prince and Bronwyn have a dance, they have the following conversation after Bronwyn steps on his toes:\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Um, excuse me. I have to go vomit in the corner now. He just MET this woman and I cannot even believe what he is doing and saying. It is disgusting and he is a pig. Thanks be to God that he didn't actually attempt to spank her at any point, or mete out any other form of punishment, because if he did this would be an instant DNF for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some days later, he stumbles upon Bronwyn in the park and there's more kissing. More mutual this time, which I was grateful for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, now, here's the rub. Alexsey's gypsy grandmother hates Bronwyn and has her heart set on him marrying Bronwyn's younger stepsister, Sorcha. So she's always arranging teas together between the families. On one of these teas, Bronwyn accidentally overhears Alexsey talking to his (even more of a jerk) best friend, Strath. He states that he WILL \"have\" Bronwyn, and what's more, he's going to actually pretend to court her so that his grandma stops nagging him about getting married.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronwyn decides to seduce him in equal measure so that ... I don't know... at the end she can say, \"gotcha!\" or something? Whatever - this is one of those ridiculous romance plans that don't make any actual sense. So they are each trying for the same thing - seduction - although with Alexsey having slept with half of Europe and Bronwyn being a virgin who was just kissed for the first time a few days ago, it's pretty much the sacrificial lamb going to slaughter here.\n",
      "...\n",
      "\n",
      "THINGS I HATED:\n",
      "1.) And this is the most important one: Alexsey, the \"hero,\" is a domineering, bossy, arrogant asshole. He refuses to take 'no' for an answer, multiple times. He tells Bronwyn what to do and expects no argument. He is toying with her and wants an affair with her even though he knows if it was ever discovered, she'd be ruined for life.\n",
      "\n",
      "He actually has sex with her (instead of playing: Everything But), seemingly forgetting, despite all his knowledge of sex and women, about a little thing called \"pregnancy.\" He can leave at any time, nothing can hurt his reputation, but she and her family will be ruined if she is pregnant. This never seems to occur to him or bother him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's constantly taking Bronwyn's spectacles off and asking her not to wear them. I'm like: \"She needs those to SEE, you asshole!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He has no regard for anyone but himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and then there's this scene. Okay, Bronwyn and Alexsey are settled in to read together. He says that she can have kisses any time she asks for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just ask,You\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What a prideful, arrogant asshole. With no sense of humor. In my opinion, men with no sense of humor are shit in bed. I felt so sad for Bronwyn. If a guy has his head this far up his own ass, there's no hope for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did I mention that he has unprotected sex with her, because he's a piece of shit with no regard for her life or feelings? Yes? Okay then.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.) Alexsey's asshole best friend, Strath, who is even MORE of a jerk than Alexsey. I know. You can't believe it. I can't either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strath, who also sleeps with anyone in a skirt, has a huge problem with Bronwyn's gorgeous younger sister, Sorcha. She's so beautiful. Because of this, Strath immediately thinks she's a stuck-up, vapid, selfish twit. Actually, Sorcha is a very sweet, caring, book-loving girl. He is judging her solely on her appearance and the fact that he lusts after her but thinks he can never possess her. This makes him very angry. This guy is the type of guy who ends up murdering women because they turned him down for a date, e.g. Elliot Rodger.\n",
      "\n",
      "And do you want to know the worst thing? The absolute worst thing?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THINGS I LIKED:\n",
      "1.) The cute, tiny, not overwhelming Cinderella aspects. Hawkins does a great job of very subtly weaving Cinderella elements into the story. It's wonderful. From the lost slipper, to the ball, to wearing her stepsisters' castoffs, to being locked in her room, ... there are just so many wonderful little details that are there if you are looking for them. But this is very underplayed, and so much the better for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.) Bronwyn's stepsisters and stepmother and not evil, but kind. Bronwyn's two stepsisters (Sorcha and Mairi) are sweet and also her best friends. Even though they are prettier than Bronwyn, and more interested in balls, all of them are loving sisters and good friends. And even though Sorcha is the most beautiful woman ever, apparently, she shares Bronwyn's love of books, and has a sweet and generous nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronwyn's stepmom is more of a tricky character - sometimes she makes it really hard to like her, but underneath she really is a good person.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.) Bronwyn's character. Even though I feel like the description of Bronwyn (plump, brown-haired, freckled, and wearing glasses) was only for show (she was obviously not chubby. I think the author just meant \"she weighs 130 instead of 100) - I felt like her PERSONALITY was really fun and quirky. She loves books, she loves her huge dogs, she willingly helps with chores, she helps her father file patents on his inventions, she is a HORRIBLE dancer (which is pretty funny during the ball scenes)... She's just got a really cute personality that I liked.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.) The best, absolute best scenes are when Bronwyn uses stuff from her romance novels to seduce Alexsey. It's HILARIOUS. Pure gold. I was laughing out loud, these scenes were so funny. She studies up on his home country, and then spouts all these facts about it over tea. Or the time when she thinks she can win him over with singing, and starts singing in the middle of a make-out session with him. OMG It was so funny. Then there's the time she decides she has to have a 'unique scent' that he will always remember her by, but can't find any good perfume, so... LOL Well, you'll have to read the book to find out where THAT goes, but trust me, it's comedic gold.\n",
      "...\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. I think that about sums it up. I couldn't go five pages without screaming \"You *&&%ing piece of trash!\" at Alexsey, so...\n",

      "\n",
      "Alexsey Romanovin enjoys his rakish ways and has no intention of marrying despite his grandmother’s machinations. When Alexsey meets brainy and bookish, Bronwyn Murdoch, he realizes that courting her is the perfect solution as she will never meet his Tata’s requirements. Bronwyn enjoys her quiet life and has plans of her own for the spoiled and arrogant prince - none of which include falling in love with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sweet, but exceedingly loose retelling of the classic Cinderella fairytale. Thankfully there is relatively little angst and no keeping secrets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronwyn is a lovely heroine and the fact that she always has her nose buried in a book makes her very relatable to the bibliophile in me. She sees straight through Alexsey’s suave charm and the seducer ends up being seduced himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Alexsey initially comes across as selfish, spoiled and immature, he grows on you and it is impossible not to appreciate the extent of his love for Bronwyn and the lengths he will go to, to win her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronwyn’s family is nothing like Cinderella’s. Although her stepmother is preoccupied with social enhancement for her daughters, she seems to truly care for Bronwyn (even though there are moments when this is questionable). Her daughters, Sorcha and Mairi, are very likable and my main complaint is that Sorcha’s relationship with Alexsey’s friend, Strath, is underdeveloped.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, a fun read and I particularly enjoyed the manner in which Hawkins subtly weaves the Cinderella elements into the plot without allowing them to overwhelm the originality of her story.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a little bit of inspiration from Cinderella, The Prince Who Loved Me tells the tale of the loveable shy spinster Bronwyn and the dashing rakehell prince Aleksey. He is intrigued by her and would like to whittle away the country hours by engaging in some bed sport. She is wary of his slick charming attitude but would like to have a real life adventure that she so often reads about in books. Both are looking for just some light and fun interactions. Fate, well it has its own agenda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronwyn is a very likable and relatable character. She lost her mother as a very young girl, began to emulate her father, worried the family with her unladylike behavior, and ended up with a stepmother and sisters. Unlike Cinderella however, Bronwyn gets along with her new family members and while she is compared to the older more beautiful one, there is no resentment or jealously. Bronwyn is very strong minded and while at times she may lack self-confidence, she also goes after what she wants; readers will enjoy cheering her on. Our hero Aleksey is the one I had a problem with. For a large part of the story he was very selfish, immature, and displayed an overall unattractively young personality. I can see why he was attracted to Bronwyn, intelligent and different from anyone he had meet before but beyond his good looks I have no idea what Bronwyn saw in Aleksey.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story moves at a good pace, I'm just not sure anything really happens for eighty percent of it. A majority of the story arc is Aleksey trying to convince Bronwyn to simply be in his presence. Their interactions are all fairly quick and barely move beyond the \"I want to seduce you\" \"I can't allow myself to be seduced! But oh my, look at those gorgeous eyes!\" Without any real substance to their connection I was left feeling very bereft when their first love scene occurred and wasn't as emotionally involved as I usually like to be when they eventually came together. The \"villainous\" grandmother and stepmother were extremely overdone and detracted from the story rather than added to it as this story arc went on for too long and overshadowed Aleksey and Bronwyn towards the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronwyn was a keeper character for me, unfortunately Aleksey never measured up. I also wish we could have seen them interact more away from the seduction/trying to avoid plot so more material could be gathered as to why these two felt such a strong connection to each other. Ms. Hawkins can write, lamentably, this book fell short.\n",

      "Full Disclosure: I Owe Part of My Heart to Kindle Alexander\n",
      "\n",
      "My use of the title of one of Kindle Alexander's best books (well, they are all \"best books\" in MY book) to lead off my headline of this review is done for two reasons: 1) It's the theme of the book, and 2) it's personal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's get the personal out of the way. I have corresponded with Ms. Alexander for a couple of years because I just love what she does with men who have some serious issues about loving other men. A lot of authors do this very well, but she does it for such a wide cross-section of men in so many situations that I just kept telling her this, and she kept writing back and we had some very nice philosophical discussions (by e-mail only, we have never met or talked or Skyped or connected by social media), and shared some personal histories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I was completely taken aback when I saw to whom she dedicated this book--Bo--and I sent off a missive asking if she knew someone else by that name, and she said, \"no, silly, it's you.\" And I nearly died on the spot--after my jaw hit the ground. Full disclosure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just so you don't think I was unduly influenced by this unbelievable honor, I wish to let you know that it took me a few days to let that settle in, and then I started to read, nervously. After all, what if I didn't like it? And, actually, the first couple of chapters, which concentrate on a bit of a family crisis in the life of computer genius and Dallas semi-mogul Dylan Reeves, threw me for a bit of a loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the jacket blurb of the book does a good job of setting the reader up for a potential romance between him and computer genius and Laguna Beach mega-mogul Tristan Wilder, the exquisitely handled introduction of Dylan's family--wife Teri, daughters Chloe and Cate, son Chad--has me shaking my head: Is this going to be one of those books where one MC, i.e., Dylan, is straight as a Texas arrow and we are getting set up for a sloppy seduction process by an admitted player in Tristan Wilder? This man Dylan Reeves is a completely devoted husband and father, and you could not even imagine where Ms. Alexander is going with this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until the last couple of pages of Chapter Two--wherein you discover that the title of the book is not only the name of Dylan's high-tech company, but also the definition of virtually every little plot twist that comes along. And, wow! Do they twist and turn--but with such deft segues, beautiful writing, and extraordinary sexual heat that you ultimately cannot put the darn book down.\n",
      "\n",
      "This one took my breath away in every way and in every chapter. It's fast-moving but not capricious, to the point but not nasty (well, one little incident is, but that's expected), mind bending but never outrageous in its premise that two alpha males just over the 35-year-old divide can blow their lives apart, but agree not to keep doing it, until there is no choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is never a choice in this book for continuing to have secrets--which is why the title of the book, the name of the company, and the plot twists are so cool to contemplate. No, the reason there is no choice is because Dylan Reeves is one of the great characters to have emerged from the M/M contemporary romance novels I have read (and there are many): He lives his life on integrity, except, of course, for one part of it which some might say qualifies him as a hypocrite, but not when you get to know him. He is walking honesty personified, and he manages to change people's lives with that honesty and integrity without leaving the other people, or the reader, raising skeptical eyebrows--a testament to Ms. Alexander's fertile imagination.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he has a wife who as a major positive player here may stun you at first, just as much as how a conflicted Tristan thrashes about trying to wrap his head around a man he cannot figure out, may take you aback at first. But when you get wrapped up in this tale, and this family, you will wonder how many other couples are in the same situation, and how few of them deal with it as this one does.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a book that will challenge you to guess when the next secret is disclosed, and how these people will deal with it. That Ms. Alexander will toss a nice little bomb in your path to each of those discoveries will rivet you to the page, this tale, and to these characters.\n",

Dylan has built a social network app that allows people to chat and then the chat completely disappears, leaving no trail. He’s gone as far as he can with it and is ready to sell so the company can be taken to higher levels. Dylan’s company, his app, is called Secret. Which is appropriate because Dylan has so many secrets. Secrets he’s been living with almost all of his adult life. You also need to know that Dylan is the best kind of man, honorable, trustworthy.

Could these two have any more road blocks in their way? I loved watching the transformation of these two, especially Tristan. He was pretty much flummoxed by his feelings for Dylan. He just wasn’t a relationship guy, up to that point anyway. He found himself willing to do anything to win Dylan over, to give him a chance. Even pretending to be a jogger on a long run and almost killing himself in the process.\n",

I do want to add in here that his three kids are absolutely amazing! He and his wife Terri, clearly did a fantastic job raising them.\n",

      "I hate when this happens and thankfully it doesn't happen often. This book is going on my Everyone Like it But Me shelf. I went back to read some reviews after I finished the book and the positive response for this book from my GoodRead friends is overwhelming. I'm glad for that, especially since I'm such a big fan of Kindle Alexander's books and have given all of them 4 and/or 5 stars. But this one did not work for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, since the blurb indicated that one of the main characters was married with children, I wanted to know if there was cheating involved before I started reading it. I'm not one who absolutely read a book with cheating (one of my favorite books of all time is Cameron Dane's where cheating is a huge part of the plot) but I like to be prepared, especially since children were involved. I don't think it's a spoiler to tell you that there was here. Dylan and his wife Teri are together only for their kids and Teri is actually involved in a two year relationship with another man when Dylan meets Tristan.\n",

Tristan Wilder wants to acquire Secret at all costs after his own company's foray into the social media business has failed spectacularly. When Dylan and Tristan meet, there is an immediate attraction, but it thankfully isn't insta-lovey where they felt the need to rip each others clothes off in the stairwell. But we do hear both men's inner monologues and the attraction is there and mutual.\n",

      "After Tristan and his team give Dylan and his team a tour of the Wilder-Nation facilities, they take them out to wine and dine them and even visit a titty bar. Tristan can see that Dylan is uncomfortable and suggests the two of them leave the group and visit another establishment that would be more to their liking. This is where my problem with Tristan starts. Tristan is all promises to Dylan that he won't force him to do anything he doesn't want to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "See a pattern here? And all that is in the ! I felt that Tristan was pushy and had his own best interests in mind from the start. The next day, he finds he is enamored with Dylan that he offers the Secret team 20% then their asking price and all the stipulations they were asking for. On one condition: That Dylan agree to drive with him at sunset in his Ferrari and have a picnic on the beach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story continues with Dylan being apprehensive in his new relationship with Tristan (some reviews I read had readers annoyed with Dylan and his closeted ways, but I felt his feelings were warranted given the circumstances) and Tristan doing everything in his power to start a relationship. Flowers, Ferrari's, private dinners with Wolfgang Puck as their chef, elaborate hotel rooms, etc.\n",

      "Tristan was just too relentless in his pursuit of Dylan and it kept me on edge throughout the entire book. I wasn't able to enjoy any of the sex because it felt just a touch dirty to me given Dylan's inexperience and Tristan's pushy tendencies. I personally , but for my one negative review, there are so YMMV. Either way, I do hope enjoy!\n",

      "It feels undoubtedly strange to review this book. In a manner of speaking, like e.g. rating the Bible; the book had (and still has) such an enormous impact on the Western history and culture that rating it feels utterly wrong.\n",
      "It is somewhat similar with the Edda. Its influence in literature cannot be put into proper words.\n",
      "However, the Edda is not a smooth read. In the translation of Bellows one can more often than not encounter archaic words or sentence structures that are unusual not only in English but generally since epic poetry has a unique style one finds nowhere else.\n",
      "Firstly, one has to get used to it. Secondly, it is necessary to pay attention to the footnotes and process what is said due to the complicated language. Thirdly, it takes time. A lot of it actually, despite the fact that this book is comparatively short.\n",
      "\n",
      "I still loved it though. From the very first page and until the very last. And after my class where we compared several translations I also feel obliged to note that Bellows translation is among the best in its precision and beauty of language. Several recent translations lack the same charm and attention when it comes to minor details of the poems, so a recommendation - if you want a beautiful and more precise translation of the Poetic Edda read Bellows.\n",
      "It starts off with the prophecy of the Vǫluspá who talks about the creation of the world, the world-ash Yggdrasil, the fate of the Gods, Ragnarök and the creation of a new, better world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vǫluspá was also one of my personal favourites. Plenty of myths, names, descriptions of the nine worlds that the ash Yggdrasil harbours and in the end a rather epic battle with all kinds of gods and monsters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Right after it comes another favourite of mine - Hávamál. A collection of proverbs and wise counsels from Odin. Advices how to live properly, how to aquire wisdom and how e.g. not to act around those who are superior. Actually, this one genuinely provides a lot of useful advices, even for present day people, perhaps because fundamental truths about codes of behaviour never change regardless whether you live in the 12th century or the 21st.\n",
      "It is simultaneously one of the most puzzling poems of the Poetic Edda and exists in no other manuscript but the infamous Codex Regius.\n",
      "Okay, sorry, this is a lot of random trivia. Fact is - it is beautiful, useful, and interesting both from the cultural, mythological and literary points of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will not dive into detail about every poem this translation contains but instead mention one more. The Lokasenna.\n",
      "Basically an exchange of insults between Loki and the other gods and goddesses whose attemps to talk back are rather ineffective. It's hilarious, simply hilarious, okay? Loki has something to say about everyone and what he says is far from flattering, a lot of funny and embarrassing stories of the gods come up and they, of course, get royally pissed off about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course the Poetic Edda is also interesting to look at from the POV of - how much did Christianity actually influence the poems and myths of the Norse people? What motifs are reoccurring and why? Where can parallels be found and so on and so forth.\n",
      "The Edda is in every sense a piece of literature worth reading, especially for those who adore Tolkien's works and Epic Fantasy since there are plenty of motifs and occurances taken from the old Norse myths.\n",

      "Highly recommended.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "The second half of the 20th Century has seen a rise in popularity of Norse mythology through various pop culture entities even though the number of sources were few and knowledge of them not widespread. The Poetic Edda: The Mythological Poems is half of a collection of anonymously written poems arranged soon after the Christianization of Scandinavia that focuses on the Norse pantheon and translated in the early 20th Century by Henry Adam Bellows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mythological poems range from the creation of the world to the twilight of the gods to everything in between about the Norse gods most notably Odin, Thor, and Loki. The opening poem “Voluspo” gives a timeline of Norse cosmology that many with barely a hint of Norse beliefs will guess. The cosmology of the Norse was further expounded in “Vafthruthnismol”, “Grimnismol”, and “Alvissmol” through various devices. One of the surprising poems is how much Thor is made fun of by everyone via insult like in “Harbarthsljoth” or put in hilarious situations like in “Thyrmskvitha” which features Thor in drag before getting his revenge, though Thor isn’t a complete fool as will be found in the aforementioned “Alvissmol”. Loki is one of the prime characters in “Thyrmskvitha” and “Lokasenna” though he plays a significant part at the end of the Norse cosmology with himself and his children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, how much Christianization creeped into these poems by the time they were written down or changed as they were written down is unknown and thus 100% authenticity is not known. Bellows’ translation reads very well, and his footnotes are excellent, the only thing that a 21st Century reader might have an issue with is that instead of spelling Odin as we do now Bellows spells it Othin and there are other words where it seems this is the case as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a fantastic translated collection of mythological poems that gives the reader a very good overview of Norse cosmology.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Let me disclaim: I have not read this cover-to-cover, because frankly the long poems which are basically lists of names are pretty boring. But there are some seriously choice stories in here, if you're willing to flip through all of it to find the awesomest ones. Aweseomest is now a word, don't argue with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lokasenna is definitely my favourite -- basically it's a story about Loki, who attends a feast with the gods and gets thrown out for killing a servant. He comes back to tell them all that he thinks very lowly of them, in much graphic detail. He's in the middle of telling Sif that she's a hussy 'cause she slept with him, when her husband arrives and he finally decides he shouldn't be badmouthing Thor's girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "And while it's supposed to be a result of (and punishment for) his arranging the death of Baldr, I like the idea that when the gods chain him up in a cave with his son's intestines, it's actually because of his smack talking. Them's fightin' words and all that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, yes! I have given this four stars not because it is four stars over all, but because if you trawl through and find the really entertaining stories, they're awesome. Go forth and read!\n",

      "Sure, it was hard to get into and I often had to put it down, but while reading it I found myself, despite the fact that some poems have been preserved only in very poor shape and that the others are not missing on their share of interpolations and gaps, honestly enjoying it.\n",
      "Everything - Odin (Othin in this translation) pretending to be someone else most of the time, Thor calling other gods \"unmanly\" (Loki) and \"womanish\" (his father Odin in disguise), somehow self-contradicting world view of the Vikings, everpresent vision of the end, ..., and hey, even lists of names and events were not that horrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Norse mythology is not as easily accessible as Greek and the myths are not always preserved enough to be comprehensive, it definitely deserves a chance from any mythology-lover.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The Indigenous Germanic tribes passed down these myths through oral storytelling tradition, and I suppose they could be around ten thousand years, old if not older. The origin of them is very complex and shrouded in mystery.\n",
      "These stories are funny, weird, fascinating, and deeply moving-and were not just stories to these people but their religion and understanding of the world, which is very important to remember.\n",
      "My favorite version of these myths is Neil Gaiman's Norse Mythology, but another version worth reading, is Henry Adams Bellows translation.\n",
      "As I was reading through this fascinating and amazing book, I found the virtues of courage, faith and hope, welling up within me, and, like C.S.Lewis, I experienced the sehnsucht joy which led him to Christ, numerous times- that transcendent longing roused by the beauty and glory of nature, music, literature, art, and love. I highly recommend this book.\n",
      "\"If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.\" C.S.Lewis\n",

      "Check out this and other reviews on my young adult book blog, Here's to Happy Endings!\n",
      "\n",
      "When I first heard about this book, I fell in love with the cover and the fact that it was focused on being tropical. While I haven’t seen Millie Marotta’s first coloring book – Animal Kingdom, I thought this one would do a wonderful job showing off some beautiful tropical artwork.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There are lots of animals (frogs, birds, big cats, etc), trees, and lots of flowers to choose from. There are even some pages in the book with directions to help add your own artwork to the book – such as creating some flowers for a bird nest in order to make it more homey. While I’m not much for drawing, I can see how these pages would definitely appeal to those who are good at it and enjoy it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the designs are pretty simple, flower-y designs, and some of them are much more intricate and time-consuming. In fact, a lot of the designs in this beautiful book are very detailed, and you would need very sharp pencils to get to a lot of these areas. I have only tried out colored pencils in this book so far, and since the illustrations are printed on both sides, I’m not sure how well markers or gel pens would work out. Either way, colored pencils definitely do a nice job when coloring these pictures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper in this coloring book is pretty thick, so you can add a lot of layers of color (at least with pencils) without worrying about ruining other pictures, and the pages are a nice bright white, so you can make these images pop with all kinds of color combinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only issue I have with this book is how a lot of the illustrations span two pages, and it can be difficult to add color close to the spine. Even on the single page illustrations, I had a bit of a difficult time fully coloring the images because of this, but it isn’t enough to ruin the awesome coloring experience that this book brings.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has a lot of variety – animals, flowers, plants, tropical designs, etc., and the illustrations are all so beautiful!\n",

      "I received this book for free from the publisher (Quirk Books) in exchange for an honest review.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved this book! I love history, especially when it comes to topics that are not talked about much. So naturally, this book was right up on my alley.\n",
      "\n",
      "This edition of the book features profiles of all the First Ladies, including the most recent one, Melania Trump. It gives a short biography about each First Lady and her time in the White House, as well as some fun facts and stories. There are also some fun illustrations (which I loved).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest takeaway from this was that so many of the First Ladies had tragic lives. Many of them were upset and cried when their husbands became president. A lot of them had to endure a bunch of bad stuff (absent husbands, children dying, health problems, long travels, etc.) to help their husbands get to the White House. I had no idea that this was the reality for a majority of them. Their lives were not as glamorous as some may have thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly anyone ever talks about the First Ladies (especially the earlier ones) so it was really insightful to learn more about them. They deserve more recognition than they get.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, if you want a fun little history lesson on the First Ladies, then look no further, this book is for you!\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I'm giving this a five star since I'd really only thought this would end up being a good bathroom reader, if you know what I mean. Instead, I found myself rereading my favorite wives or referencing them in conversation. The short excerpts are perfect for a shorter attention span (or a bathroom reader, lol). All the extra insider details read like that favorite history teacher who gave you all the real scoop.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "There isn't so much plot in this book as there is anecdote - and yet it still manages to capture attention and flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance - Martha Washington might have been involved in the death of her first husband's half-brother? It's just not the picture I had in my mind of our first First Lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "And being as Grover Cleveland wasn't particularly prominent in my childhood education, I hadn't heard the details of his White House marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really, Grover? Your former ward? The daughter of your best friend? Proof that there were People of Wal Mart long before there was Wal Mart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because\n",
      "is not a story, but a series of vignettes taking a gossipy look at the lives of the women behind the men leading the nation, it can be read in short bursts while waiting for kids at sports practices, at doctor's offices, or while waiting for the slow wheels of bureaucracy to... do anything. Leaving and coming back to the stories presents no hardship in how they are processed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Cormac O'Brien writes up gossip better than the Daily Mail, so the entertainment promised is delivered with exponents tacked onto the end. Delivered so well, in fact, that I immediately bought his .\n",
      "\n",
      "On a final note, I had no idea that Martin Van Buren neglected to even mention his wife in his memoirs. What a jerk.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Well, that was fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "My f-t-f book club is reading the lives of First Ladies, each participant picking one and reading about her, but, of course, I couldn't do that, so instead I decided to read about all of them (up to 2005, anyway, the book's copyright date).\n",
      "\n",
      "I found I especially liked Mary Todd Lincoln (who doesn't?), Lou Henry Hoover (a geologist), Lady Bird Johnson (with such a bossy husband), Laura Bush (who knew she smoked until the 1990s?), as well as Abigail Fillmore (started a library at the White House) and Florence Harding (wife of the most corrupt president...though this title could be questioned today, perhaps).\n",
      "\n",
      "What did the best of these First Ladies have in common? Ambitious for their husbands. Very bright. Right hand man of the president. Able to overlook flaws of the presidents and focus on their strengths. Multi-taskers. A strong sense of what was right.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fun read. I may look for more of this series from Quirk Books.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This was different than the stories you get of presidents. This is from the woman side, you find out that a lot of will-be presidents married up for money or prestige. I’m sure love too. There were a lot of first ladies that didn’t want their husband going to the White House. There are more first ladies more troubled than you’ll believe but there are more ladies more talented than we ever knew. The women in the book were more interesting than their husbands.\n",
      "Jason Rekulak was an editor of this book. He wrote a fantastic book called “Impossible Fortress.”\n",
      "The writing was entertaining and there was a lot of information.\n",

      "This is not a who done it, because you know who done it: Father Zach's so-called friend, Bishop Peter, transferred a priest with history of pedophilia to a poor parish and let the chips fall where they will. And fall, they did. Why? Because that's the way it's always been done. Protect the institution, and silence the victims. Problem: the offender ended up murdered by Migo, a young man he abused. In Riker's Island, Migo is befriended by Father Zach who is having his own problems as a gay priest ordered to keep quiet about it. But he can't keep quiet about Migo, once he knows that it was Peter who put him in harm's way.\n",
      "So what it Father Zach's choice? Be loyal to the concept of that's the way we always do it, or justice for Migo?\n",

      "The black wall of silence, has not crumbled, it still exists. However, Pope Francis' words and pastoral actions give the Church and the world hope. But, the Church is not one person, Francis is going to need people to work along with him to accomplish his dreams. Pray that he survives long enough to accomplish the much needed resurrection in the Church.\n",
      "I have long felt it is a pity a person must die before being \"officially\" declared a saint. On the other hand, a living saint might hit a bump in life's road before dying and really mess up their sainthoodedness.\n",

      "Very good book, second chance story with a mystery going along with it. This isn't really a stand alone story as the first book, A Brother's Honor, should be read first to get the full story. The main focus in this book is Caden, the middle brother, and his relationship with Shiloh. Caden and Shiloh had been friends as kids, until Caden's mother was murdered and his father imprisoned for it. Shiloh's parents forbid her from seeing him again. They renewed their friendship after they were grown and away from home, where it grew into a deep love for each other. Their plans to elope were interfered with, leaving Caden feeling betrayed and Shiloh wondering what happened. Four years later Caden finally learns the truth and is determined to win back Shiloh's love and trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caden came across as a bit of a jerk at the beginning. His attitude toward Shiloh when she came to him with what she discovered about their aborted wedding was really bad. I got that he was hurt by what he saw as her betrayal, but considering the source of the information he should have investigated more. I liked the way that he realized how badly he had screwed up once he did have the truth and knew it was going to be a struggle to win Shiloh back. Shiloh had suffered from her heartbreak for a long time, and after the latest confrontation with Caden had finally decided it was time to move on. Having him show up and admit he was wrong was satisfying for her, but she wasn't so sure she wanted to risk her heart again. I enjoyed Caden's persistence and Shiloh's attempts to resist. A near death experience for Caden showed Shiloh that her love for him hadn't died and being together was more important than hanging on to her hurt. Their relationship continues to grow as they deal with questions of who might be trying to kill him and the ongoing puzzle of who was really responsible for his mother's murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the story are more clues showing that Shep Granger is indeed innocent of his wife's murders. He may be stuck in prison, but he is still receiving threats against his family if anyone tries to prove him innocent. I love seeing how he has made use of his time in prison and the influence he has had on the lives of others. That influence ends up helping him protect his family, even from behind bars. I also enjoyed seeing his relationship with his lawyer and look forward to more of it in the next book. The clues we get about the murder lead to the idea that there was more to it than a lover's quarrel. The last chapter contains a twist that I really didn't see coming and will be very interested in seeing what comes of it in the next book.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also some good parts dealing with the ongoing relationship between Jace and Shana. I loved seeing the way that Jace's happiness is an example for his two brothers, even though they may not always appreciate it. They are still dealing with some of the fallout from the corporate spying in the first book and a suspected murder has them thinking that their troubles aren't over yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shana's dad also has a continuing storyline with his new lady friend. I loved his conviction that her blindness doesn't matter. I really liked his conversation with his daughter about his feelings for her late mother and the difference in his feelings now.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most enjoyable parts of the book is Dalton's search for the woman that he met in a bar one night. Dalton is the brother who is the biggest player of them all. He's never had to work for a woman's attention and it seems to have gone to his head. When he tracks down the mystery lady he's surprised when she wants nothing to do with him. He has an even bigger surprise in store when he finds out who she is. His book should be very interesting.\n",

      "I thoroughly enjoyed this book, hence the 5 out of 5 rating. It is the second book in a series, but it contains enough details so that you'll know what's going on and get caught up in the story. There's a romance, naturally, and an ongoing mystery that continues through the series. I highly recommend. Kudos Ms. Jackson!\n",

      "I loved it and found it a continuation of the first series...'A Brother's Honor.' I would definitely suggest you read the first series to truly understand what is going on in the second series. \"A Man's Promise\" was mainly of Caden Granger and Shiloh Timmons love story and it was a real interesting one that will bring to us 'lies, misunderstandings, secrets hurt and betrayal.' Now add some mystery, suspense, romance, drama and conspiracy into all of that and you have one amazing story that just keep on going into the next series. ..Dalton's story. I don't want to give too much away just know that the Granger brothers...Jace, Caden and Dalton will give you a such a intensed read from start to finish. By picking up 'A Man's Promise' you will find that this author has done a excellent job giving us a well written novel from start to finish with all of its twist and turns. The characters were all simply off the chart ...well wait a moment...their were a few to shake you head at...but mostly all were well developed, well portrayed, colorful and so believable only helping to give the reader a well attention grabber and oh yes I loved that ending...a cliffhanger. This was very well done. The only thing left to say is I will be waiting for the next series.. about Dalton and I am sure there will be even more for us... unlocking and tying it all together in this who, what, when and why of it all in this last series.\n",

      "Bronwyn is a minor Scottish lady. She, her eccentric inventor father, her stepmother, and her two younger stepsisters are living in genteel poverty - able to keep on a servant and a cook, but sometimes unable to afford firewood or the ingredients for apple tarts. Sense and Sensibility-like.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, Bronwyn is reading in the forest with her two wolfhounds, Walter and Scott. A huntsman chasing a small fluffy white dog bursts into the clearing. He is Alexsey. He is an arrogant jerk. In this opening scene, he snatches away a book she's been reading, reads a few passages out loud, and declares its kissing descriptions to be bunk. When Bronwyn protests, he states that she must know nothing about kissing, and starts kissing her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was like, \"Excuse me. You just met this woman. You don't know her. She doesn't know you. You guys are alone in an isolated part of the forest. She didn't flirt with you or make any sign that she wanted to be kissed by you. You do not have a right to touch her. Back the fuck off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She runs off, leaving a shoe behind, which Alexsey keeps. He thinks she is a servant girl and is excited at the thought of having an affair with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 40 pages later, there is a ball. Bronwyn, who at 24 is considered \"on the shelf,\" attends as a chaperone for her two younger sisters. There she is surprised to learn that the huntsman who kissed her in the forest is really a half-fake-Russian-speaking country/half-Gypsy prince. And he is surprised and dismayed to find that she is a minor lady. That will make his seduction of her all the more difficult. Her mother immediately starts pushing her gorgeous middle daughter, Sorcha, at the prince.\n",

Thanks be to God that he didn't actually attempt to spank her at any point, or mete out any other form of punishment, because if he did this would be an instant DNF for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some days later, he stumbles upon Bronwyn in the park and there's more kissing. More mutual this time, which I was grateful for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, now, here's the rub. Alexsey's gypsy grandmother hates Bronwyn and has her heart set on him marrying Bronwyn's younger stepsister, Sorcha. So she's always arranging teas together between the families. On one of these teas, Bronwyn accidentally overhears Alexsey talking to his (even more of a jerk) best friend, Strath. He states that he WILL \"have\" Bronwyn, and what's more, he's going to actually pretend to court her so that his grandma stops nagging him about getting married.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronwyn decides to seduce him in equal measure so that ... I don't know... at the end she can say, \"gotcha!\" or something? Whatever - this is one of those ridiculous romance plans that don't make any actual sense. So they are each trying for the same thing - seduction - although with Alexsey having slept with half of Europe and Bronwyn being a virgin who was just kissed for the first time a few days ago, it's pretty much the sacrificial lamb going to slaughter here.\n",

      "THINGS I HATED:\n",
      "1.) And this is the most important one: Alexsey, the \"hero,\" is a domineering, bossy, arrogant asshole. He refuses to take 'no' for an answer, multiple times. He tells Bronwyn what to do and expects no argument. He is toying with her and wants an affair with her even though he knows if it was ever discovered, she'd be ruined for life.\n",
      "\n",
      "He actually has sex with her (instead of playing: Everything But), seemingly forgetting, despite all his knowledge of sex and women, about a little thing called \"pregnancy.\" He can leave at any time, nothing can hurt his reputation, but she and her family will be ruined if she is pregnant. This never seems to occur to him or bother him.\n",

He is judging her solely on her appearance and the fact that he lusts after her but thinks he can never possess her. This makes him very angry.

      "THINGS I LIKED:\n",
      "1.) The cute, tiny, not overwhelming Cinderella aspects. Hawkins does a great job of very subtly weaving Cinderella elements into the story. It's wonderful. From the lost slipper, to the ball, to wearing her stepsisters' castoffs, to being locked in her room, ... there are just so many wonderful little details that are there if you are looking for them. But this is very underplayed, and so much the better for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.) Bronwyn's stepsisters and stepmother and not evil, but kind. Bronwyn's two stepsisters (Sorcha and Mairi) are sweet and also her best friends. Even though they are prettier than Bronwyn, and more interested in balls, all of them are loving sisters and good friends. And even though Sorcha is the most beautiful woman ever, apparently, she shares Bronwyn's love of books, and has a sweet and generous nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronwyn's stepmom is more of a tricky character - sometimes she makes it really hard to like her, but underneath she really is a good person.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.) Bronwyn's character. Even though I feel like the description of Bronwyn (plump, brown-haired, freckled, and wearing glasses) was only for show (she was obviously not chubby. I think the author just meant \"she weighs 130 instead of 100) - I felt like her PERSONALITY was really fun and quirky. She loves books, she loves her huge dogs, she willingly helps with chores, she helps her father file patents on his inventions, she is a HORRIBLE dancer (which is pretty funny during the ball scenes)... She's just got a really cute personality that I liked.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.) The best, absolute best scenes are when Bronwyn uses stuff from her romance novels to seduce Alexsey. It's HILARIOUS. Pure gold. I was laughing out loud, these scenes were so funny. She studies up on his home country, and then spouts all these facts about it over tea. Or the time when she thinks she can win him over with singing, and starts singing in the middle of a make-out session with him. OMG It was so funny. Then there's the time she decides she has to have a 'unique scent' that he will always remember her by, but can't find any good perfume, so... LOL Well, you'll have to read the book to find out where THAT goes, but trust me, it's comedic gold.\n",

      "Alexsey Romanovin enjoys his rakish ways and has no intention of marrying despite his grandmother’s machinations. When Alexsey meets brainy and bookish, Bronwyn Murdoch, he realizes that courting her is the perfect solution as she will never meet his Tata’s requirements. Bronwyn enjoys her quiet life and has plans of her own for the spoiled and arrogant prince - none of which include falling in love with him.\n",

Although her stepmother is preoccupied with social enhancement for her daughters, she seems to truly care for Bronwyn (even though there are moments when this is questionable).

      "\n",
      "With a little bit of inspiration from Cinderella, The Prince Who Loved Me tells the tale of the loveable shy spinster Bronwyn and the dashing rakehell prince Aleksey. He is intrigued by her and would like to whittle away the country hours by engaging in some bed sport. She is wary of his slick charming attitude but would like to have a real life adventure that she so often reads about in books. Both are looking for just some light and fun interactions. Fate, well it has its own agenda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronwyn is a very likable and relatable character. She lost her mother as a very young girl, began to emulate her father, worried the family with her unladylike behavior, and ended up with a stepmother and sisters. Unlike Cinderella however, Bronwyn gets along with her new family members and while she is compared to the older more beautiful one, there is no resentment or jealously. Bronwyn is very strong minded and while at times she may lack self-confidence, she also goes after what she wants; readers will enjoy cheering her on. Our hero Aleksey is the one I had a problem with. For a large part of the story he was very selfish, immature, and displayed an overall unattractively young personality. I can see why he was attracted to Bronwyn, intelligent and different from anyone he had meet before but beyond his good looks I have no idea what Bronwyn saw in Aleksey.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story moves at a good pace, I'm just not sure anything really happens for eighty percent of it. A majority of the story arc is Aleksey trying to convince Bronwyn to simply be in his presence. Their interactions are all fairly quick and barely move beyond the \"I want to seduce you\" \"I can't allow myself to be seduced! But oh my, look at those gorgeous eyes!\" Without any real substance to their connection I was left feeling very bereft when their first love scene occurred and wasn't as emotionally involved as I usually like to be when they eventually came together. The \"villainous\" grandmother and stepmother were extremely overdone and detracted from the story rather than added to it as this story arc went on for too long and overshadowed Aleksey and Bronwyn towards the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronwyn was a keeper character for me, unfortunately Aleksey never measured up. I also wish we could have seen them interact more away from the seduction/trying to avoid plot so more material could be gathered as to why these two felt such a strong connection to each other. Ms. Hawkins can write, lamentably, this book fell short.\n",

      "Full Disclosure: I Owe Part of My Heart to Kindle Alexander\n",
      "\n",
      "My use of the title of one of Kindle Alexander's best books (well, they are all \"best books\" in MY book) to lead off my headline of this review is done for two reasons: 1) It's the theme of the book, and 2) it's personal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's get the personal out of the way. I have corresponded with Ms. Alexander for a couple of years because I just love what she does with men who have some serious issues about loving other men. A lot of authors do this very well, but she does it for such a wide cross-section of men in so many situations that I just kept telling her this, and she kept writing back and we had some very nice philosophical discussions (by e-mail only, we have never met or talked or Skyped or connected by social media), and shared some personal histories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I was completely taken aback when I saw to whom she dedicated this book--Bo--and I sent off a missive asking if she knew someone else by that name, and she said, \"no, silly, it's you.\" And I nearly died on the spot--after my jaw hit the ground. Full disclosure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just so you don't think I was unduly influenced by this unbelievable honor, I wish to let you know that it took me a few days to let that settle in, and then I started to read, nervously. After all, what if I didn't like it? And, actually, the first couple of chapters, which concentrate on a bit of a family crisis in the life of computer genius and Dallas semi-mogul Dylan Reeves, threw me for a bit of a loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the jacket blurb of the book does a good job of setting the reader up for a potential romance between him and computer genius and Laguna Beach mega-mogul Tristan Wilder, the exquisitely handled introduction of Dylan's family--wife Teri, daughters Chloe and Cate, son Chad--has me shaking my head: Is this going to be one of those books where one MC, i.e., Dylan, is straight as a Texas arrow and we are getting set up for a sloppy seduction process by an admitted player in Tristan Wilder? This man Dylan Reeves is a completely devoted husband and father, and you could not even imagine where Ms. Alexander is going with this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until the last couple of pages of Chapter Two--wherein you discover that the title of the book is not only the name of Dylan's high-tech company, but also the definition of virtually every little plot twist that comes along. And, wow! Do they twist and turn--but with such deft segues, beautiful writing, and extraordinary sexual heat that you ultimately cannot put the darn book down.\n",
      "\n",
      "This one took my breath away in every way and in every chapter. It's fast-moving but not capricious, to the point but not nasty (well, one little incident is, but that's expected), mind bending but never outrageous in its premise that two alpha males just over the 35-year-old divide can blow their lives apart, but agree not to keep doing it, until there is no choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is never a choice in this book for continuing to have secrets--which is why the title of the book, the name of the company, and the plot twists are so cool to contemplate. No, the reason there is no choice is because Dylan Reeves is one of the great characters to have emerged from the M/M contemporary romance novels I have read (and there are many): He lives his life on integrity, except, of course, for one part of it which some might say qualifies him as a hypocrite, but not when you get to know him. He is walking honesty personified, and he manages to change people's lives with that honesty and integrity without leaving the other people, or the reader, raising skeptical eyebrows--a testament to Ms. Alexander's fertile imagination.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he has a wife who as a major positive player here may stun you at first, just as much as how a conflicted Tristan thrashes about trying to wrap his head around a man he cannot figure out, may take you aback at first. But when you get wrapped up in this tale, and this family, you will wonder how many other couples are in the same situation, and how few of them deal with it as this one does.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a book that will challenge you to guess when the next secret is disclosed, and how these people will deal with it. That Ms. Alexander will toss a nice little bomb in your path to each of those discoveries will rivet you to the page, this tale, and to these characters.\n",

He’s gone as far as he can with it and is ready to sell so the company can be taken to higher levels. Dylan’s company, his app, is called Secret.

Could these two have any more road blocks in their way? I loved watching the transformation of these two, especially Tristan. He was pretty much flummoxed by his feelings for Dylan. He just wasn’t a relationship guy, up to that point anyway. He found himself willing to do anything to win Dylan over, to give him a chance. Even pretending to be a jogger on a long run and almost killing himself in the process.\n",

      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I hate when this happens and thankfully it doesn't happen often. This book is going on my Everyone Like it But Me shelf. I went back to read some reviews after I finished the book and the positive response for this book from my GoodRead friends is overwhelming. I'm glad for that, especially since I'm such a big fan of Kindle Alexander's books and have given all of them 4 and/or 5 stars. But this one did not work for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, since the blurb indicated that one of the main characters was married with children, I wanted to know if there was cheating involved before I started reading it. I'm not one who absolutely read a book with cheating (one of my favorite books of all time is Cameron Dane's where cheating is a huge part of the plot) but I like to be prepared, especially since children were involved. I don't think it's a spoiler to tell you that there was here. Dylan and his wife Teri are together only for their kids and Teri is actually involved in a two year relationship with another man when Dylan meets Tristan.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we have a deeply closeted man, Dylan Reeves, who is the creator of a social media app that all the big name companies what to acquire. He and his team travel to California to meet with the team at Wilder-Nation (described as a Google clone) and start negotiations to sell them Secret, the app that has millions of users. Tristan Wilder wants to acquire Secret at all costs after his own company's foray into the social media business has failed spectacularly. When Dylan and Tristan meet, there is an immediate attraction, but it thankfully isn't insta-lovey where they felt the need to rip each others clothes off in the stairwell. But we do hear both men's inner monologues and the attraction is there and mutual.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Tristan and his team give Dylan and his team a tour of the Wilder-Nation facilities, they take them out to wine and dine them and even visit a titty bar. Tristan can see that Dylan is uncomfortable and suggests the two of them leave the group and visit another establishment that would be more to their liking. This is where my problem with Tristan starts. Tristan is all promises to Dylan that he won't force him to do anything he doesn't want to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "See a pattern here? And all that is in the ! I felt that Tristan was pushy and had his own best interests in mind from the start. The next day, he finds he is enamored with Dylan that he offers the Secret team 20% then their asking price and all the stipulations they were asking for. On one condition: That Dylan agree to drive with him at sunset in his Ferrari and have a picnic on the beach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story continues with Dylan being apprehensive in his new relationship with Tristan (some reviews I read had readers annoyed with Dylan and his closeted ways, but I felt his feelings were warranted given the circumstances) and Tristan doing everything in his power to start a relationship. Flowers, Ferrari's, private dinners with Wolfgang Puck as their chef, elaborate hotel rooms, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, the boys do eventually get their HEA and all family members come to grips (incredibly quickly, if you ask me) with the changes in status and Secret is an astounding success. The end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tristan was just too relentless in his pursuit of Dylan and it kept me on edge throughout the entire book. I wasn't able to enjoy any of the sex because it felt just a touch dirty to me given Dylan's inexperience and Tristan's pushy tendencies. I personally , but for my one negative review, there are so YMMV. Either way, I do hope enjoy!\n",

      "Review 1\n",
      "==============\n",
      "It feels undoubtedly strange to review this book. In a manner of speaking, like e.g. rating the Bible; the book had (and still has) such an enormous impact on the Western history and culture that rating it feels utterly wrong.\n",
      "It is somewhat similar with the Edda. Its influence in literature cannot be put into proper words.\n",
      "However, the Edda is not a smooth read. In the translation of Bellows one can more often than not encounter archaic words or sentence structures that are unusual not only in English but generally since epic poetry has a unique style one finds nowhere else.\n",
      "Firstly, one has to get used to it. Secondly, it is necessary to pay attention to the footnotes and process what is said due to the complicated language. Thirdly, it takes time. A lot of it actually, despite the fact that this book is comparatively short.\n",
      "\n",
      "I still loved it though. From the very first page and until the very last. And after my class where we compared several translations I also feel obliged to note that Bellows translation is among the best in its precision and beauty of language. Several recent translations lack the same charm and attention when it comes to minor details of the poems, so a recommendation - if you want a beautiful and more precise translation of the Poetic Edda read Bellows.\n",
      "It starts off with the prophecy of the Vǫluspá who talks about the creation of the world, the world-ash Yggdrasil, the fate of the Gods, Ragnarök and the creation of a new, better world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vǫluspá was also one of my personal favourites. Plenty of myths, names, descriptions of the nine worlds that the ash Yggdrasil harbours and in the end a rather epic battle with all kinds of gods and monsters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Right after it comes another favourite of mine - Hávamál. A collection of proverbs and wise counsels from Odin. Advices how to live properly, how to aquire wisdom and how e.g. not to act around those who are superior. Actually, this one genuinely provides a lot of useful advices, even for present day people, perhaps because fundamental truths about codes of behaviour never change regardless whether you live in the 12th century or the 21st.\n",
      "It is simultaneously one of the most puzzling poems of the Poetic Edda and exists in no other manuscript but the infamous Codex Regius.\n",
      "Okay, sorry, this is a lot of random trivia. Fact is - it is beautiful, useful, and interesting both from the cultural, mythological and literary points of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will not dive into detail about every poem this translation contains but instead mention one more. The Lokasenna.\n",
      "Basically an exchange of insults between Loki and the other gods and goddesses whose attemps to talk back are rather ineffective. It's hilarious, simply hilarious, okay? Loki has something to say about everyone and what he says is far from flattering, a lot of funny and embarrassing stories of the gods come up and they, of course, get royally pissed off about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course the Poetic Edda is also interesting to look at from the POV of - how much did Christianity actually influence the poems and myths of the Norse people? What motifs are reoccurring and why? Where can parallels be found and so on and so forth.\n",
      "The Edda is in every sense a piece of literature worth reading, especially for those who adore Tolkien's works and Epic Fantasy since there are plenty of motifs and occurances taken from the old Norse myths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Highly recommended.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The second half of the 20th Century has seen a rise in popularity of Norse mythology through various pop culture entities even though the number of sources were few and knowledge of them not widespread. The Poetic Edda: The Mythological Poems is half of a collection of anonymously written poems arranged soon after the Christianization of Scandinavia that focuses on the Norse pantheon and translated in the early 20th Century by Henry Adam Bellows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mythological poems range from the creation of the world to the twilight of the gods to everything in between about the Norse gods most notably Odin, Thor, and Loki. The opening poem “Voluspo” gives a timeline of Norse cosmology that many with barely a hint of Norse beliefs will guess. The cosmology of the Norse was further expounded in “Vafthruthnismol”, “Grimnismol”, and “Alvissmol” through various devices. One of the surprising poems is how much Thor is made fun of by everyone via insult like in “Harbarthsljoth” or put in hilarious situations like in “Thyrmskvitha” which features Thor in drag before getting his revenge, though Thor isn’t a complete fool as will be found in the aforementioned “Alvissmol”. Loki is one of the prime characters in “Thyrmskvitha” and “Lokasenna” though he plays a significant part at the end of the Norse cosmology with himself and his children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, how much Christianization creeped into these poems by the time they were written down or changed as they were written down is unknown and thus 100% authenticity is not known. Bellows’ translation reads very well, and his footnotes are excellent, the only thing that a 21st Century reader might have an issue with is that instead of spelling Odin as we do now Bellows spells it Othin and there are other words where it seems this is the case as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a fantastic translated collection of mythological poems that gives the reader a very good overview of Norse cosmology.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Let me disclaim: I have not read this cover-to-cover, because frankly the long poems which are basically lists of names are pretty boring. But there are some seriously choice stories in here, if you're willing to flip through all of it to find the awesomest ones. Aweseomest is now a word, don't argue with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lokasenna is definitely my favourite -- basically it's a story about Loki, who attends a feast with the gods and gets thrown out for killing a servant. He comes back to tell them all that he thinks very lowly of them, in much graphic detail. He's in the middle of telling Sif that she's a hussy 'cause she slept with him, when her husband arrives and he finally decides he shouldn't be badmouthing Thor's girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "And while it's supposed to be a result of (and punishment for) his arranging the death of Baldr, I like the idea that when the gods chain him up in a cave with his son's intestines, it's actually because of his smack talking. Them's fightin' words and all that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, yes! I have given this four stars not because it is four stars over all, but because if you trawl through and find the really entertaining stories, they're awesome. Go forth and read!\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Before reading Bellows' translation of The Poetic Edda: The Mythological Poems, most of my (poor) knowlegde of Norse mythology originated, more or less, from sources like Wikipedia.\n",
      "Prose Edda or maybe even a moderen day retelling of Norse myths might had been a better choice as an introduction to the topic (recomented by both people and common sense), but screw it, I wanted to read the original poems before I changed my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Totally worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, it was hard to get into and I often had to put it down, but while reading it I found myself, despite the fact that some poems have been preserved only in very poor shape and that the others are not missing on their share of interpolations and gaps, honestly enjoying it.\n",
      "Everything - Odin (Othin in this translation) pretending to be someone else most of the time, Thor calling other gods \"unmanly\" (Loki) and \"womanish\" (his father Odin in disguise), somehow self-contradicting world view of the Vikings, everpresent vision of the end, ..., and hey, even lists of names and events were not that horrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Norse mythology is not as easily accessible as Greek and the myths are not always preserved enough to be comprehensive, it definitely deserves a chance from any mythology-lover.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The Indigenous Germanic tribes passed down these myths through oral storytelling tradition, and I suppose they could be around ten thousand years, old if not older. The origin of them is very complex and shrouded in mystery.\n",
      "These stories are funny, weird, fascinating, and deeply moving-and were not just stories to these people but their religion and understanding of the world, which is very important to remember.\n",
      "My favorite version of these myths is Neil Gaiman's Norse Mythology, but another version worth reading, is Henry Adams Bellows translation.\n",
      "As I was reading through this fascinating and amazing book, I found the virtues of courage, faith and hope, welling up within me, and, like C.S.Lewis, I experienced the sehnsucht joy which led him to Christ, numerous times- that transcendent longing roused by the beauty and glory of nature, music, literature, art, and love. I highly recommend this book.\n",

      "Now you know my secret – I am a long time, hard core fan of The Sound of Music. I own the LP and CD; DVDs in three languages (do check out the Japanese version – ‘delicious noodles’ are one of the favourite things) and have seen several stage versions. Nothing can compare to the original movie though. Because it was filmed pre-DVD extras (goodness, even before DVD and video invention), there has not been that much ‘extra’ information out there, although the most recent DVD release is very, very good. That is why we need this book – written by the seven actors who played the von Trapp children. The book focuses on the children’s experience – so you will find little from Julie Andrews or Christophe Plummer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book contains many photographs that I’ve never seen before – behind the scenes shots and photos lovingly taken by the parents who accompanied them to Austria (except for Charmian Carr, who played Liesl – she was 21 at the time). Considering this was pre-digital cameras and pre-mobile phone cameras, there’s a lot of material. Each of the ‘children’ (naturally all adults now, doing a range of things – not all involving acting) has a section of their own, explaining their lives pre and post The Sound of Music. It’s fascinating to think that little Kym Karath (Gretl) is now all grown up and that Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich) now calls Australia home! There are also sections on how certain scenes were filmed (e.g. The ‘Do-Re-Mi’ montage) and the premiere. Did you know Charmian Carr got to travel the world for 2 years promoting the movie? Now I know definitely that I would like to be Liesl!\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait – there’s even more for fans. There are several sections containing facsimiles of items to do with the movie – from Angela Cartwright (Brigitta) and Heather Menzies’ (Louisa) secret club rulebook, Nicholas Hammond’s (partial) script and premiere tickets. There’s also a DVD of home movies taken in Austria and beyond – but please remember that camcorder technology wasn’t as developed in the 1960s. While interesting, there’s a buzzing sound which is kind of annoying (I suggest you turn the sound down) and some blurred footage. It’s still a lot of fun though, from the beautiful landscapes to the gorgeous 60’s wardrobes.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several typos in the book – the last page has a caption for ‘Julia’ Andrews for example and there’s a few full stops missing. That shouldn’t detract you away from this gorgeous book though. It’s definitely something to treasure for fans.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Because I am a sap, The Sound of Music is my favorite movie. I am well aware that the real von Trapp family did not swing from trees and skip down the road clad in clothes fashioned from curtains all the while singing about drops of golden sun. Nonetheless, the music and images never fail to bring a smile to my face. If I'm listening, I guarantee I WILL sing along. This scrapbook, created to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the movie's release, is filled with cast photos, script notes, music sheets, and anecdotes. The coffee table makes for an ideal home, perfect for perusing at one's leisure, and is a great gift for the saps in your life.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A must-have in any \"Sound of Music\" lover's library. It is full of pictures and replicated memorabilia of the seven children along with personal anecdotes and stories written by each actor. It was a joy to read their thoughts and memories and see how the bonds they created 45 years ago are still as strong.\n",

      "I've just recently started exploring the SoulPancake website, and decided to buy the book because I liked the idea behind it. It's not necessarily a book that requires a lot of reading - which could be a good thing. SoulPancake provides you with thought-provoking quotes and prompts that should make you ponder life's questions. While being a bookworm certainly has its benefits, SoulPancake makes me realize the importance of finding the beauty in life by taking action, making decisions, and digging deeper into the soul to discover what is really important. You can think as much as you want, but it's not until you put your thoughts into action that they really develop meaning and purpose.\n",

      "I was so excited when I heard this book was coming out. I'm a huge \"Dwight Schrute\" fan, & when I heard that Rainn Wilson wrote a book combining spirituality, art, & what it means to be human, it immediately caught my interest. This book is a quick read, but gives you lots to think about. It also gave me ideas on things I could do to inspire myself! A lot of the questions asked in this book will really make you think about WHY you think & believe the way you do. I love to delve into the deeper things of life, to find the meaning in everything, as I believe everything happens for a reason. This book will help you get to know yourself better & also offers a lot of interesting art to look at! I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to take a deeper look within.\n",

      "A fantastic book to make you contemplate many of life's big questions, fuelled by inspirational art and quotes. This is a great book to read alone, taking your time to really contemplate the thoughts raised on each page (I would recommend min one day per double page). There are a small number of practical activities the book suggests for you too, some of which can be quite interesting (although some I worried could be disrespectful or a recipe for arrest, such as gatecrashing a stranger's funeral or the reverse-pickpocket). Soul Pancake also makes for a fantastic collection of interesting conversation starters for both online or real life conversations!\n",
      "\n",
      "My only gripe was that so many of the questions seemed to be focused on the idea of regret for the past or wanting to change the past. As someone who has no interest in either, about a quarter of the questions seemed irrelevant (I'm probably exaggerating).\n",

      "\n",
      "Review 1\n",
      "==============\n",
      "When Edward St. Aubyn's dead and his legacy gets hammered out, Lost for Words will be considered one of his minor works.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't get me wrong, this book was fun enough. I read it in a day, and when I put it down, looked forward to picking it up again. But ultimately I found it slight, disappointing, and not nearly as good as its writer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which is, you know, fine. We're all entitled to a good time, and St. Aubyn has the right to hit the little bloop single instead of crushing everything out of the park. Though I'm normally very cheap and a big library user, I plopped down almost thirty bucks for this skinny thing yesterday, and I'm not bitter or regretful at all. I'm happy to have supported my local bookstore, FSG, and this gifted writer; I should buy new books more often. eased the pain of a trip to the DMV and provided an evening of diversion (\"arresting my attention in the midst of distraction,\" as one character might have it), and I'm not asking for my money back.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were some things that kind of bummed me out about this book, though. A satire of the Booker Prize selection process from an author who's been subject to it sounds pretty fun, and I guess it is, but the book lacks the sense of special access that I would have liked. Of course, there must of been tons of this and it was just such inside baseball that it all just flew way over my head, but unfortunately a lot of the characters just seemed like stock caricatures so it didn't matter if they were based on real people in ways that would've been hilarious had I only known. And not to sound like a shrew, but the female characters mostly sucked, from the man-eating sex siren to the not-one-but-two negligent mothers who'd alienated their offspring by focusing too much on their careers. I guess to be fair, though, the male characters kind of sucked too. I felt I'd seen most of them before, except for the Indian prince, and there were good reasons for that... Let's just say that if St. Aubyn were normally a sculptor, this cast of characters would represent his foray into two-dimensional media.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which again, hey, that's fine, man. Paint a picture, draw a comic, take it easy for a change! Here's the thing I didn't like here, though no other readers seemed to mind it so probably I'm just too dumb to understand the brilliance of this book: satire of low-hanging fruit, that has good guys and bad guys, doesn't mean all that much at the end of the day. It's essentially television. That is, it can represent something and make a statement about it, but it doesn't really do what I think a novel's meant to do, and expose a truth to transform the way its readers understand the world. Some of the characters in this book are ridiculous idiots, while others are -- I think -- supposed to be sympathetic real-ish people, and this split just didn't work for me. At first I assumed we were in for it, but by the end I felt that some of us had become cartoons while others of us got to be turned into real boys with dignity by an authorial blue fairy, and maybe I just didn't understand the book properly, but I found this disappointing. It seemed like I was supposed to side with certain characters' views of literature and come out of it all with my own cherished notions intact, and I just expected to finish this with more damage than a giggle at some pretty predictable targets. That is, I feel St. Aubyn is capable of a brutal scorched earth campaign but he restrained himself here to selective shots and not very difficult ones. (Unless I missed the whole point, which is always highly possible, and in this case I'm suspicious that I did.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, a lot of this book comprises parodies of various literary (or not so literary) styles, and while they're cute, they're not nearly as awesome or as funny as I wanted them to be. That kind of trick -- whatever it's called -- is one of my all-time favorite literary devices, but for it to work the way it's supposed to I need to look forward to the italicized parts. I didn't at all here, though, and sort of groaned when I got to them, because St. Aubyn writing as St. Aubyn is a billion times better than St. Aubyn writing as Irvine Welsh or whoever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which brings me to my real final point, which is that while the end of this book was completely stupid (which did leave me cranky) and the characters were lame, it was still written extraordinarily well by a guy who truly understands the English language, so who fucking cares? I'd read Edward St. Aubyn's g-chats -- in fact, I kind of feel I just have -- and it'd still be more enjoyable than most of the crap that gets published and given prestigious prizes these days... which was maybe all he was trying to say.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The 2011 Booker awards season is the gift that keeps on giving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chair that year was Stella Rimington, an ex-spymaster for MI5 whose purported link to literature is her retirement hobby of penning apparently adequately competent spy thrillers. She wasn’t off to a good start with the literary critics (who she likened to the KGB) when she announced that this year the focus would be on “readability”. One of her judges supported her by saying that for him, the novels “had to zip along”. Oh. My. God! exclaimed the literati. Zippiness? Readability? What about the quality of the writing, of the deeper meanings and layers of the story?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, there certainly are books that embrace all of those qualities — they are not mutually exclusive. But they also weren’t on that Booker list. My own conspiracy theory was that the presence of Snowdrops was a case of mistaken identity: the nomination should have gone to , author of the far better book , rather than Andrew Miller (), author of the mediocre . But once such a mistake is committed, it would be impossible to correct.\n",
      "It was fun, nonetheless, to read the snarky articles and comments that permeated the book pages at the Guardian etc as well as the book blogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Redemption was achieved when won. And now it has also provided inspiration for this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a deliciously fun romp. The sponsor of the prestigious book prize is Elysian, a controversial manufacturer of herbicides and pesticides, They are the usual corporate bad guy looking for disguise in the purifying robes of “the Arts”.\n",
      "The Chair of the jury, an MP on the downhill slope, accepts the job because of “backbench boredom”, and a need to get more public attention. The jurors include a celebrity columnist whose “ruling passion was ‘relevance’”. Another juror is an academic, an unavoidable but undesirable type — but There is an ex-girlfriend of the Elysian director in charge of the awards. She writes. Badly. But her books are popular. These were some of the funniest parts of the book, written in a free indirect style of Penny Feathers. Excerpts of her writings show flat, plodding simple sentences notable only for the extraordinary density of cliches. I thought of my GR friends when Penny rewards her own hard work with a Paris weekend at the Ritz,\n",
      "\n",
      "And just as the quality of the jury is questionable, so too is that of the books on the long list. This includes an accidentally submitted cookbook, which the columnist champions as a “ludic, postmodern, multi-media masterpiece.” Could this be the parallel to the Andrew Millers mix-up of the real Booker?\n",
      "It all proceeds in a somewhat chaotic fashion, hopping from one viewpoint to the other, and like all good satire, revealing truths along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "And who can resist the ultimate irony that this book turned out itself to win a major award, The Wodehouse Prize for comic fiction, which encourages even more sniping — the book is too superficial, the satire too broad, the targets too easy. It is what it is, and for what it is, it is a funny and well-written commentary on the world of literary awards. Just have fun with it.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Before I begin this review, let me just state that I loved the Edward St Aubyn Patrick Melrose novels. When my book club chose this as a monthly choice, I was very pleased and eager to read something else by him. Unlike previous works by St Aubyn which I have read, this is a satirical look at a fictitious literary prize, the Elysian Prize; although the author barely bothers to disguise the fact that he is writing about the Booker.\n",
      "\n",
      "We begin with a backbench MP with an ailing career, Malcolm Craig, being asked to chair the committee. Hoping for some press coverage he agrees, but is obviously only interested in pushing through the books he is backing and being generally in control. Also on the committee is an actor who virtually never appears at meetings, a well known columnist and media personality who is passionate about ‘relevance,’ an Oxbridge academic, with an anorexic daughter, who is interested in ‘good writing,’ and thriller writer, Penny, an old girlfriend of Sir David Hampshire who organised the committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with these characters are, of course, the writers. They mostly circle around the beautiful novelist, Katherine Burns, and include the neurotic Sam Black, who years for her, Sonny, an upper class Indian with designs on the Elysian Prize, his aunt who somehow finds her cook book entered by mistake and a scattered number of publishers and agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this was humorous, and is filled with excepts from the various novels either submitted or written by the characters, you cannot help but feel St Aubyn had more fun writing this than we have reading it. There are a lot of jokes that have circled around the Booker – bizarre choices, books submitted by mistake and more. However, it is full of stereotypes and did not really do more than make me smile in places. I forgive this author anything for the sublime Melrose novels, but sadly this did not really match those in any way, despite being a pleasant enough read.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Die Idee ist gut: Eine Jury eines Literaturpreises, in der sich teilweise Menschen tummeln, die von Literatur wenig Ahnung haben, dafür aber umso lieber Ränke schmieden. Autoren, die höchst eitel sind. Bücher, die nur aus Versehen auf die Longlist geraten. Befindlichkeiten und Intrigen, wenig Literatur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oder nein, nicht ganz: Von einigen der Autoren lesen wir auch Auszüge ihres Schaffens. Was St. Aubyn die Gelegenheit verschafft, sich in verschiedenen Genres und auf unterschiedlichen Niveaus zu bewegen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Warum hat mich dieser Roman dennoch gelangweilt? Weilt die Figuren seltsam fleischlos wirken. Vor allem aber, weil ich St. Aubyn von der Melrose-Reihe als wesentlich pointierter und zynischer kenne. Das hätte dieser Geschichte auch gut getan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also alles in allem: Akzeptable Unterhaltung, nicht mehr. Und damit drei sehr freundliche Sterne.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A spoof on a literary prize event, that is also a telling indictment on this form of reward system that is skewing literary appreciation for writers.\n",
      "\n",
      "An environmentally unfriendly company manufacturing cancer-causing herbicides and pesticides (familiar?) decides to buy some goodwill by sponsoring a Commonwealth-wide literary prize. The politician appointed to chair the selection committee, Malcolm, is “pre-advised” as to which books need to make the long list by the head of the prize granting organization. The rest of the committee is made up of a secretary who is dreaming of her own writing career, an actor who is mostly off-stage, a journalist who favours underdogs, and a lone literary voice who believes that “literature must have depth, beauty, structural integrity and an ability to revive tired imaginations.” This idealism is lost on Malcolm of course, who, in keeping with his political conditioning, is looking for “compromise among all members” as his goal, irrespective of the outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the candidates in the running for the prize: Katherine, a nymphomaniacal ingénue who is sleeping with her editor Allan, and with two other writers at the same time: Didier the paradoxical theorist and Sam the angst-ridden insomniac; Sonny, the maharajah from India who believes his self-published book is a winner; and the aforementioned Sam, who is also probably the best of the literary lot. Oh, and lest we forget there, is also an Indian Cookbook, written by Sonny’s aunty that gets submitted by accident and is included in the long list due to the journalist committee member’s desire to favour the underdog!\n",
      "\n",
      "St. Aubyn is a briliant wordsmith and delivers this story in beautifully constructed prose, weaving his plot skillfully as we pop in an out of the heads of the entire cast. Ego’s rise and fall: Katherine breaks up with Sam as his book goes ahead of hers into the short list; Allan gets fired for screwing up Katherine’s submission; and Sonny cooks up a diabolical plan to assassinate the committee for spurning his book. Literary truisms abound: “Art based on impact, rather than process, structure, or insight is doomed to the jackhammer of monotony of having to shock again and again.” “Money has value because it can be exchanged for something else. Art only has value because it can’t.” and “What’s worse than an unexploded bomb in your basement? An exploding one!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The finale, of course, is the predictable awards ceremony at which we find the committee still in deadlock at the eleventh hour, split between the purists and the politicians, between the deserving and the undeserving. And of course, what happens if you end up with two favourites and cannot decide between them? Well, you'll have to read the book to find out. As for literary merit, it doesn't count for much with this award.\n",

      "I first came upon Swale via the excellent film 'Summerland' that she both wrote and directed, that (not coincidentally) also starred Gemma Arterton. I was so impressed with her writing, I wanted more, and for the most part, this fun historical romp did not disappoint. Apparently this is a revised edition that the playwright rewrote following the first production, and it still could use a bit of tweaking and some judicious editing. But it's loads of fun, and loved the postmodern nod to Titanic!\n",

      "As people who follow my reviews probably know, I love history plays, and this one is a very good one. Nell Gwynn (also spelled Gwyn or Gwynne) is one of those really intriguing figures who managed to overcome the normal limitations of a rigidly hierarchical social class system and rise from obscure poverty to wealth, fame, and power. Partly her rise was due to being in the right place at the right time--i.e., around the theatre in the first years women were allowed to perform on the English stage--but the larger part was Nell's wit and intelligence, which captivated fellow actors, audiences, and King Charles II. Although in Swale's play, Nell declares that she doesn't want to be political, as one of Charles' most important mistresses (probably the most important), she had to negotiate a world of court etiquette and intrigue for which her upbringing in Cheapside would have provided little preparation. Simultaneously, she was one of the most beloved actors of the Restoration stage, and with a small number of other women played a key role in establishing women as talented and (semi-)respectable performers.\n",
      "Swale does not give a documentary account of Nell's life and career (as she makes clear in the interview published at the beginning of this version), but she does a really good job of showing the various challenges of Nell's life and how she struggled but ultimately succeeded at managing them.\n",

The more I read the more I realised this book is essential a science trivia book. This is the best description of it. It doesn’t talk about specific field or specific scientists. It has stories, poems, really lame jokes, equations, book recommendations, first this and first that, drawings, historical events, etc. The only theme sewing all this together is science. It is a great book for these minutiae. You’ll sure care about some stuff and don’t give a hoot about others, and this is normal for a book of trivia.\n",

It was such a mix up and collection of all sorts of fields and disciplines, it definitely kept me engaged and the turnover of information was so quick, it didn’t give me a chance to get bored!\n",

      "\n",
      "It’s easy to read and entertaining too, and I’m not embarrassed to say I totally repeated some of the jokes too although as to whether they laughed is debatable (I did!).

      "==============\n",
      "This book caught my attention when I was at my local library and I couldn't resist checking it out as in my other life away from blogging, I am actually a (geeky) scientist. On the whole, it was filled with some interesting facts and trivia and I did manage to find out things that I didn't previously know, which was my aim of reading it, as my speciality is usually biochemistry. Some parts however, I did find a bit hard to get through, and anything involving physics went right over my head I'm afraid! So, just an idea what scientific treats are in this book - we have the Periodic Table, binary, the Richter scale, biological classification, genetics, evolution, threatened and endangered species and a short history of the atom to name a few. But don't worry, if this all sounds a bit scary, the author makes things a bit lighter with poems and diagrams and even several scientific jokes:\n",

      "Or how about some real molecules with some very funny names? Like ARSOLE - a ring molecule containing arsenic and DIUREA which it should be no surprise to learn that it is used in the fertiliser industry. If that didn't really float your boat how about an experiment or two that you can do at home? For example, making your own pH indicator scale that tells you how acid or alkaline a solution is simply by using some red cabbage, a kettle, a pan and some glass jars or bottles. There is also a second experiment that allows you to measure the speed of light using just chocolate, a microwave and a ruler. Sounds fun, right? Or how would you like to compare your intelligence to a fifteen year old taking exams in 1858 with a few example questions. On second thoughts, maybe you don't want to do this, I was hideously embarrassed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, there is a great little Appendix in the back of this book (although I wish it had been larger and included reminders of the physics education I am sorely lacking) and it gives a great little summary on the structure of atoms, the biology of the cell, some basic genetics and explanations of Newton's laws. In general, I did enjoy this book and am glad I read it and definitely appreciated the lighter side that the author brought to the text, proving that yes, science can be interesting and fun!\n",

      "I have a list of popular science book ideas that I occasionally revisit – things I quite fancy writing in the future. Now I have to cross one of them off the list, because Simon Flynn has written it for me. My list describes it as a popular science version of Schott’s Miscellany, but Flynn has called it by the (to me, rather clumsy) title The Science Magpie.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least, that’s what I assume it is, because I have to confess, I’ve never read Schott’s Miscellany, so I don’t know what it contains – I merely assume it’s this kind of kaleidoscopic mix of all manner of facts, from the quite interesting to the downright weird. It’s the sort of book you can imagine Stephen Fry curling up with of an evening before hosting QI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inevitably in such an inspired hotch-potch there will always be some entries that inspire more than most. I loved, for instance, real molecules with silly names, the 1858 Cambridge University exam questions and the curly snail periodic table. Other parts are more ‘Hmm’ moments, like a whole page of digits of pi, while still others simply get a little dull. Often this is a transcription of a historical document – I have fallen for this one myself. They fascinate if you are researching the particular topic, but to the general reader they can fall a little flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nice thing though is that, even if there’s a topic that doesn’t really grab you, you know that in the next page or two there will be something completely different. There is no order to all this, it is just stuff accumulated at random, like one of those wonderful old fashioned museums where you get a Victorian vacuum cleaner alongside an Egyptian mummy. Delicious.\n",

      "I learned that it talks about one most popular follege football conferences called the \"Big East\" conference. The book also talks about some of the NFL's most popular Hall of Famers named Dan Marino,Johnny Unitas ,Jim brown,Ernie Davis,and Tony Dorssett. Even my favorite running back Steve Slaton played for the \"Big East\" football team called the \"West Virginia Moutaineers\". Michael Vick also played for the \"Big East\". The played he played for was called the \"West Virginia Hokies\".\n",

      "If you love zombies, campy humor, or 1950s style ads, this is The Zombie Tarot deck for you. The 78 card deck comes in a sturdy box that looks like an ammo box when you are taking off the lid. An instruction booklet is provided for those who want some guidance in how to conduct a reading. A description of the major and minor arcane are included as well – so you will know just what they mean for your reading!\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the book there are a few advertisements too. You know – for those items you just know you need like Zombigone: “Sufferers From the Walking Death use Zombigone to feel ALIVE again!” I’m sure knowing these items are available will come in quite handy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cards themselves are masters of 1950s style art, with zombies added in of course. A favorite, The Wheel of Fortune, shows a zombie up on a knife-throwing wheel. The description of the card tells you this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Taking the Wheel of Fortune out for a spin may result in more than a little dizziness. Sure, some things are out of your hands, but you’d be silly to leave your fate to chance. You control more of your destiny than you think. Opportunities are headed your way. Don’t try to fight it just go with the flow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another, the Six of Cups features a precious little girl all dressed up with her little zombie boy friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ahh, the carefree days of childhood! No zombie plagues, no hiding in abandoned houses, and your best friend was always at your side. Well, there’s good news: someone from your past may soon arrive for a visit. Just don’t mistake a friendly kiss on the cheek for a zombie gnawing off your face.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This deck will help you with the undeniable impending zombie infestation or zombie apocalypse if you will. It will guide you in the correct actions and help you remain calm in a time of turbulence. The Zombie Tarot is a “prediction/protection” resource providing “insight and ammunition for surviving the undead uprising”. Adding this to your stockpile of ammunition and supplies hidden in the basement, attic, or between your walls is a necessity to ensure your future.\n",

      "“We find out who the good writers are, and then we look or wait for their next book. Such writers—living or dead, whatever genre they write in, critically fashionable or not, academically approved or not—are those who not only meet our expectations but surpass them. That is the gift the great storytellers have. They tell the same stories over and over (how many stories are there?), but when they tell them they are new, they are news, they renew us, they show us the world made new.”\n",
      "Yes, this is exactly what happened when I read my first Le Guin over a decade ago. Ursula K. Le Guin is now my literary hero. And this book of her essays and talks gives a glimpse into the brilliant mind behind the brilliant stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subjects she touches upon here are mainly related to writing, literature and imagination in different ways. Creating stories; rhythm in poetry and prose; fantasy as it relates to describing reality; the blurring of lines between fiction and libraries; the traditional silencing of female voice in literature; Mark Twain and female roles; Tolstoy and his “happy families” line criticism from the vantage point of years lived; her humorous and yet sharp takedown of Hemingway’s bravado-filled uber-machismo; her love ode to public libraries; the power of oral storytelling. And also thoughts on life, aging, oppression, freedom, power, and the art and craft of writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What shines through every piece is Le Guin’s intellect, inquisitiveness, feminism, ability to look at things from a viewpoint new and different, confidence mixed with a bit of self-deprecation — and what stood out for me especially, her razor-sharp wit and pointed humor.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always think of Le Guin’s fiction as profound and serious. But in her essays she is surprisingly playful, making light even of serious themes while still somehow staying serious. Her sense of humor is spot-on, her delivery is precise, her wit is sharp.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ursula K. Le Guin, born in 1928, was one of the few women in a traditionally very male-dominated science fiction genre. She knows firsthand the difficulty that presented. She’s well-aware of the perception that if three women judges have only books written by women on a literary prize shortlist it will be seen as a feminist cabal conspiracy, but if men picked all books written by men it will be seen as credible. Or how about something closer to “real” life —\n",
      "\n",
      "Ursula K. Le Guin is the person I can listen to for hours and hours. She’s eloquent, she’s perceptive, she’s deliberate and funny and serious. My book was highlighted so much that it’s easier to see the non-highlighted parts. She has perfected her craft and knows that writing is as much - or more - of a craft you work on as it is art. Where does she get her ideas? Well, she works at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Le Guin knows very well how it felt working in the genre that often gets dismissed as “inferior” to modern realism, the red-headed stepchild of literary world — fantasy and science fiction. Despite fantasy relying on imagination, daring to envision not just how things are but how they can be different — because imagination is central to us, important for our foundations.\n",

      "Este libro contiene diferentes conferencias y artículos de Ursula K. Le Guin revisados por ella misma (y muchas veces ampliados) para aparecer en este volumen.\n",
      "Llevo un mes saboreando cada uno de los artículos, ojalá este libro tuviera mil páginas y no 400. Aquí Le Guin nos habla de su experiencia como escritora, como lectora, como mujer. Conocemos retazos de su infancia, de las lecturas que le marcaron (Tolkien, Tolstoi y Virginia Woolf están muy presentes en este libro ♡), de sus colegas escritores, del machismo, del taoísmo...\n",
      "Este volumen resume muy bien muchas de , muy entretenida, con ironía y sentido crítico. Tan solo en la parte central hay un par de ensayos que me resultaron un poquito más densos, pero de verdad que el 95 % del libro se lee solo y es un auténtico disfrute.\n",
      "Hay muchas cosas sobre las que reflexiona Le Guin que acabaron rondándome la cabeza durante días, este es uno de esos libros. Me gustó muchísimo esa reivindicación de \"contar historias\", contarlas en voz alta (como hacen las madres, los abuelos, como se hacía al principio de los tiempos), esa reflexión sobre que la y que la importancia del lector es enorme, sobre que la escritura es encontrar el ritmo, subirte a la ola, esperar pacientemente hasta que lo tienes y luego dejarse llevar... hay anécdotas que me impactaron especialmente, como esa en la que comenta cómo un jurado compuesto por mujeres le habría dado el primer premio y los de consolación a 4 mujeres y ante el miedo de que las tildaran de feministas radicales y eso influenciara negativamente a la ganadora, decidieron darle a dos hombres los segundos premios.\n",
      "En fin, este es un libro maravilloso, y como dice la editorial en una nota: \"un milagro\" que haya llegado a nuestro mercado, así que toca disfrutarlo, leerlo y releerlo, aprender de todo lo que esta maravillosa autora tenía por enseñarnos.\n",
      "Y sí, os gustará mucho más si sois , pero no creo que sea necesario para disfrutarlo.\n",

      "Ας φανταστούμε λοιπόν έναν κήπο με ρόδα. Ένας ροδώνας είναι τα κείμενα αυτά της Ούρσουλας Λε Γκεν. Μπαίνεις μέσα - η πόρτα είναι διάπλατα ανοιχτή - και κόβεις όσες θέλεις από τις μπουμπουκιασμένες σκέψεις της. Δε χρειάζεται φειδώ· είναι τόσο γόνιμο το έδαφος, που σίγουρα ό,τι έκοψες θα ξαναφυτρώσει, στην επόμενη ανάγνωση θα είναι και πάλι εκεί, να σου ξαναδιεγείρει τους νευρώνες, να αγγίξει μια άλλη χορδή.\n",

Άξια υπερασπίστρια του είδους της, μας πείθει πως , το μυθιστόρημα φαντασίας, δεν είναι σε καμία περίπτωση υποδεέστερο από το ρεαλιστικό μυθιστόρημα. Η επινόηση έχει το πλεονέκτημα της εκτόξευσης της φαντασίας που μάλλον δεν ωχριά απέναντι στην κάθε μίμηση. Και η φαντασία είναι ένα πολυεργαλείο για τον ανθρώπινο νου· οφείλει να το χρησιμοποιεί.\n",

      "Recently I’ve been working on a novel, wrote like the wind for two weeks. Then it stopped. Busy-ness interfered. This morning, to break the block, I lay on the couch at nine a.m. something I do not allow myself to do on a bright spring workday full of energy and ideas. Determined to do nothing unless the novel resurrect. What made me stop the flow? Some slight or silent criticism perhaps, the Easter Retreat, worry about money, wrinkles, the cat. Doesn’t matter – to an author any excuse will do in the moment – and I said I was fine with letting the new novel grow on its own. Maybe it’s not a real idea, or a good story, or too close to ‘fact’, or a million other rationalizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I know, after so long practicing the craft, that I can break this inertia by reading another writer on writing. And I have renewed this book too many times, let fines build up, just couldn’t be finished with it. Finally I realized I did not want to finish it. I wanted always to be reading it. Always seeing it as it journeyed around my home from bed to table to kitchen to laptop case to guest room to coffee table again. I wanted this book to be mine. But, yet, the library far distant from which my library had obtained it, was determined to have it back. So yesterday I made the commitment to return it. And break the block – as I knew it would. Having this book to complete reading is like having a writer’s insurance policy that pays off with more words.\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters, Virginia Woolf in 1926 in response to Vita Sackville-West letter:\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the , you are quite wrong. (Already amazing, to say quite baldly to a lover, you are quite wrong, what courage!) Style is a very simple matter: it is all rhythm. Once you get that, you can’t use the wrong words. (Awed) But on the other hand here am I sitting after half the morning, crammed with ideas, and visions, and so on, and can’t dislodge them, for lack of the right rhythm. , (n.b), what rhythm is, and goes far deeper than words. A sight, an emotion, creates this wave in the mind, long before it makes words to fit it; and in writing – such is my present belief – one has to recapture this, and set this working - which has nothing to apparently to do with the words – and then as it breaks and tumbles in the mind, it makes words to fit it. But no doubt I shall think differently next year. (Parenthesis and bold are mine, not VW’s)\n",
      "\n",
      "Ursula, pardon me I have to call her that, begins and ends her book with this quote. In the beginning I wasn’t sure I caught what Virginia really meant. Something about inspiration and the ocean possibly, yet more. By the end of book, I saw more clearly what they are both talking about, that writing that’s real comes from the profound place inside which carries the words across the sea of self, makes a big splash as the consciousness gets it, big enough to notice and wipe the drops onto paper. Playing by the sea, writing is bare feet with sand socks, maybe a pail and shovel, a sunhat if you are lucky to keep from being burned as the relentless motion brings the story forth. OK, I really did write that trying not to edit and adultize the feeling, just write. Just connect the poet said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever I understood that phrase to mean, while understanding it in the moment, also allowed my characters whom I have already grown fond of and missed hearing from, to break through my excuses. Here I am writing again, in a review, but at the same time, Sam, Dan, Alyce (working names) are pitching their book to me. I am making notes from them right along side the Ursula notes – since I have to return the book today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are samples of key Ursula ideas that helped me get back on my novel’s tracks:\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 234: Writing is a high wire act on cobwebs. Trust your own sense of balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 253: (I’m going to photocopy this whole passage to keep). The Papa’s (Hemingway and Freud) agree that writers write for money and women. Ursula says: writers don’t write FOR anything. Then she discusses the importance Hemingway attributed to ‘experience.’ I remember being eighteen, wanting to be a writer someday, lamenting to my girlfriends, who rolled their eyes at me, but how do I get that kind of experience in Bethesda?\n",
      "\n",
      "Then on Page 273, Ursula explodes the Papas with “Aspiring writers keep telling me they’ll start writing when they’ve gathered enough experience. Usually I keep my mouth shut, but sometimes I can’t control myself and ask them, ah, like Jane Austen? Like the Bronte sisters? Those women with their wild, mad lives cram full of gut-wrenching adventure working as stevedores in the Congo and shooting up drugs in Rio and hunting lions on Kilimanjaro and having sex in SoHo and all that stuff that writers have to do – well, that some writers have to do?” Are we talking males here, of course, I answer myself. Ursula then concedes that writers need context of living in order to deepen their awareness. But what we really need, as Sinclair Lewis declared is “to apply seat to chair and get to work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 261: The Question I Get Asked Most Often chapter: How do you get your ideas? Ursula answers: “I like what Willie Nelson says: the air is full of tunes, I just reach up and pick one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 276: “In my books, particularly the first one, people sail around all the time on the sea in small boats. They do it quite convincingly, and many people understandably assume that I spent years sailing around on the sea in small boats.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My entire experience with sailboats was in my junior semester in Berkeley High School, when they let us take Sailing for gym credit. On a windy day in the Berkeley Marina, my friend Jean and I managed to overturn and sink a nine-foot catboat in three feet of water. We sang “Nearer My God to Thee” as she went down, and then waded a half mile back to the boathouse. The boatman was incredulous. ‘You sank it? He said, How?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Her point: do your research. Take your experience and expand through research of others, ask questions etc. What is my novel about? Well, the navigating the sea and boat building partially of which I have only web experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Ursula Le Guin changed my mind. I arose full of wind, ready to resume the novel. But first I wish to honor the great writer willing to pass on her wisdom: remember fiction is basically a lie made into a story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now grab the skeins of your experience add with others’ knowledge and weave into whole cloth. May yours become cloth-of-gold.\n",

      "Ας μιλήσουμε λίγο για τη φαντασία, τη δημιουργική φαντασία: το primum mobile και τη Μεγάλη Πορεία που οδηγεί στη μοναδική άξια λόγου ουτοπία, εκείνη του έργου τέχνης. Η τέχνη, έχει πολλάκις ειπωθεί, δεν είναι αναπαράσταση, δεν είναι αναπαραγωγή του υπάρχοντος. Χρησιμοποιεί τα υλικά της εμπειρικής πραγματικότητας, τσαλαβουτάει στα ρηχά νερά της, αλλά αυτό που αναδύεται από εκεί είναι κάτι παντελώς διαφορετικό: είναι επινόηση, πάει να πει φαντασία.\n",
      "\n",
      "Αν αναζητήσουμε ένα λογοτεχνικό παράδειγμα, το πλέον τρανταχτό είναι το τέρας του Frankenstein, όπως απεικονίζεται στο σπουδαίο έργο της Mary Shelley. Από τη μία πλευρά ο Δημιουργός και ο ρεαλιστικός κόσμος στον οποίο κατοικεί. Από την άλλη το Δημιούργημα, ένα πλάσμα τεχνητό, από αποδιαλέγια σωμάτων, ενδεδυμένο με κουρέλια, συρραφή, άρνηση του υπάρχοντος, ύβρις στην κατεστημένη πράξη πραγμάτων, τη θεϊκή μα και ανθρώπινη κυριαρχία. Κι αυτό που δίνει ζωή στην επινόηση, το ηλεκτρικό ρεύμα, ο σπινθήρας που ενώνει δια παντός τον Δημιουργό και το Δημιούργημα (και ως κατάληξη τους αναγνώστες) είναι η φαντασία.\n",
      "\n",
      "Η Ursula Le Guin (είχε προτίμηση στο Λε Γκουίν ως προφορά) υπήρξε συγγραφέας της fantasy, της science fiction, του φανταστικού, του παράδοξου. Η Le Guin δεν έκανε τίποτα περισσότερο ή λιγότερο από εκείνο που έκαναν και κάνουν όλοι οι συγγραφείς από καταβολής: επινόησε χαρακτήρες, επινόησε τόπους και κόσμους για να τους τοποθετήσει εντός, και στη συνέχεια εμφύσησε πνοή (πάντα ο συγγραφέας σε ρόλο Frankenstein) για να τους δώσει ζωή. Σκηνοθέτησε τη δράση, αναμόχλευσε τα πάθη, εμβολίασε με αντισώματα φαντασίας την παθογόνο πραγματικότητα, συγγράφοντας βιβλία και νουβέλες και διηγήματα που κοσμούν τη λογοτεχνία, μα όχι αποκλειστικά τη λογοτεχνία είδους (genre). Το μαρτυρούν βέβαια τα βραβεία και οι πλείστες διακρίσεις, αλλά και κάτι σημαντικότερο: η διάρκεια, η επίδραση του έργου της τόσο σε ομοτέχνους της όσο και γενικότερα (θυμίζω δύο βασικά έργα: «Ο αναρχικός των δύο κόσμων» και «Το αριστερό χέρι του σκότους»).\n",
      "\n",
      "Όλα αυτά θεωρούνται οικεία σε πολλούς. Σίγουρα, όμως, δεν είναι αποδεκτά από όλους. Η κοινότοπη αλήθεια είναι ότι ζούμε σε έναν κόσμο παρεξηγήσεων. Έναν κόσμο όπου ο «ρεαλισμός» στην τέχνη υμνείται, καθότι θωπεύει στοργικά το αίσθημα ανασφάλειας του αναγνώστη που είναι αναγκασμένος να ζει μια λειψή, πεπερασμένη ζωή σε έναν κόσμο ακατανόητο, μάταιο και μόνιμα ξένο στην αντίληψή του. Και η τέχνη ετούτου του κόσμου οφείλει να είναι στοργική, να υπενθυμίζει διαρκώς το οικείο, εξοβελίζοντας το αγνώστου ταυτότητος, επαναφέροντας στην τάξη το απείθαρχο, καθιστώντας το άρρητο. Η μοναχική φωνή που καλεί στα όπλα φοβίζει, είναι άναρχη και δυσήνια.\n",
      "\n",
      "Επιπρόσθετα, ο κόσμος αυτός κατοικείται από όντα τα οποία έχουν διαφορετικές αντιλήψεις, φερ’ ειπείν, για το ρόλο του φύλου όσον αφορά όχι μόνο την προσωπική /κοινωνική διάσταση της ύπαρξης, αλλά και τη δημιουργία (λογοτεχνίας, τέχνης εν γένει). Και εκεί το αλλότριο απωθείται, αν δεν εκπέσει σταδιακά σε μίμηση, παρωδία, σχετλιασμό, οπότε γίνεται ελεγχόμενο και ανενεργό. Μα οι παρεξηγήσεις δεν σταματούν στα προαναφερθέντα. Πώς θα μπορούσαν;\n",
      "\n",
      "Ετούτο το βιβλίο, εσκεμμένα μακρηγορώ, είναι μια απάντηση ενά��τια σε όλες αυτές τις παρεξηγήσεις. Όχι όμως με τη μορφή ενός ακόμα «Κατηγορώ». Η επιχειρηματολογία του δεν είναι αυστηρά πολεμική, εκείνη μιας έμπλεου οργής νεανικής γυναικείας φωνής που αναζητά στη μάχη το κλέος και την αυτοπραγμάτωση. Εδώ, στα κείμενα αυτά, ακούμε τη στεντόρεια και ταυτόχρονα πειστική φωνή της ηλικιωμένης συγγραφέως/ γυναίκας, η οποία καταθέτει το απόσταγμα της σκέψης της. Δηκτική, ως όφειλε, απέναντι στα στερεότυπα (οι παρεξηγήσεις που προανέφερα), δεν χαρίζεται ούτε φυγομαχεί όποτε κρίνει ότι το απαιτεί η περίσταση (το κείμενο για τα τακούνια, τη γυναικεία ομορφιά, τα λογοτεχνικά βραβεία), επιχειρώντας στο κέντρο του προβλήματος. Με λόγο στιβαρό, αλλά όχι απολυταρχικό, ex cathedra διδασκαλία, αποφεύγει αφορισμούς θεμελιωμένους στις αναφορές σε αυθεντίες που υποδηλώνουν ανασφάλεια και έλλειψη προσωπικού ύφους.\n",
      "\n",
      "Η στόχευσή της Le Guin είναι ευρύτερη, διόλου περιοριστική. Η σιγουριά της ώριμης διανοούμενης ξεχειλίζει από κάθε κείμενο που περιέχεται στην όμορφη και προσεγμένη αυτή έκδοση (Στάσει Εκπίπτοντες). Συνομιλεί με ένα οικουμενικό κοινό, με το οποίο μοιράζεται τους προβληματισμούς της και τις απόψεις σχετικά με προσωπικές ανησυχίες, την τέχνη, τη συγγραφή και τα διαβάσματά της, μα και την ανθρωπολογία, την επιστήμη και το φύλο της. Μοιράζεται με εμάς, το κοινό της, τι συνιστά έργο τέχνης, ποιος είναι ο ρόλος του συγγραφέα, ποιες οι ανησυχίες του, τι τον καθιστά συγγραφέα (στο εξαιρετικό κεφάλαιο «Για τη γραφή»). Ταυτόχρονα στέκεται και στις προσδοκίες του αναγνώστη, τον ρόλο του, δεδομένου ότι πρόκειται περί σχέσης η οποία απαιτεί συμπόρευση, ανιδιοτέλεια, εμπιστοσύνη, ενός είδους αμφοτεροβαρούς συμβολαίου, προκειμένου να ευοδωθεί.\n",
      "\n",
      "«Το διάβασμα είναι ένας τρόπος να αφουγκράζεσαι. Το διάβασμα δεν είναι τόσο παθητικό όσο το άκουσμα ή το κοίταγμα. Διαβάζεις με τον ρυθμό σου, με τη δική σου ταχύτητα, όχι με την αδιάκοπη, ασυνάρτητη, τρεχάτη, φωνακλάδικη φούρια των μίντια. Παίρνεις ό,τι μπορείς και ό,τι θέλεις να πάρεις και όχι ό,τι ξεφορτώνουν πάνω σου τόσο γρήγορα, τόσο απότομα και τόσο μεγαλόφωνα ώστε να πνίγεσαι».\n",
      "\n",
      "Η Le Guin επιμένει και επανέρχεται πεισματικά στη μαγική λειτουργία της ανάγνωσης, στον τρόπο με τον οποίο το έργο τέχνης, το βιβλίο εν προκειμένω, λειτουργεί ως εμβρυουλκός της φαντασίας, ως έναρξη διαλόγου του αναγνώστη με τον συγγραφέα και την ίδια στιγμή με τον εαυτό του. Διακρίνει δε την ανάγνωση από τις άλλες τέχνες -επ’ ουδενί κατατάσσοντάς τη αξιολογικά- θεωρώντας τη την πλέον ενεργητική όλων. Δικαίως, διότι πειθαρχεί μεν το εν εγρηγόρσει πνεύμα που εστιάζεται στις ανάγκες του κειμένου (εμπρός-πίσω, επανάληψη της σελίδας), ταυτόχρονα δε απελευθερώνει τη φαντασία του αναγνώστη, ο οποίος αποσπάται εξολοκλήρου από την εργαλειακή διάσταση του παρόντος, απελευθερωμένος από τα δεσμά που συνιστά η πεπερασμένη του ύπαρξη. Στη λογική αυτή, η ενεργητική ανάγνωση είναι ίσως από τις ελάχιστες συνειδητές πράξεις, αν όχι της εφήμερης ζωής μας, τουλάχιστον της καθημερινότητάς μας.\n",
      "\n",
      "Η θεματολογία ποικίλει, το ύφος όμως είναι εκείνο μιας εξαιρετικής τεχνίτριας του λόγου. Ούτε στιγμή η Le Guin δεν ξεχνά ότι είναι πρώτιστα συγγραφέας και τούτη η ομολογία διατρέχει όλη την έκταση του βιβλίου ετούτου, καθιστώντας το απολαυστικό στην ανάγνωσή του. Ακόμα κι όταν προτάσσει την αιχμή της, καθότι το απαιτεί το θέμα με το οποίο ασχολείται, το πράττει με καλλιτεχνικό τρόπο, οπότε το επιχείρημα στιλβώνεται λογοτεχνικά. Το αποτέλεσμα είναι αφενός ο αναγνώστης να προδιατίθεται θετικά στα διακυβευόμενα κι αφετέρου να ευφραίνεται αναγνωστικά. Όσοι διαβάζουν τακτικά βιβλία κριτικής, δοκιμιακού λόγου, γνωρίζουν (συχνά πικρή εμπειρία) πόσο σπάνιο γνώρισμα είναι αυτό, δεδομένου ότι ο γράφων/ουσα δεν είναι απαραιτήτως συγγραφέας.\n",
      "\n",
      "Καίτοι ο τόμος αυτός έχει έκταση περίπου 400 σελίδες, ο αναγνώστης δεν νιώθει σχεδόν καμία στιγμή είτε ότι η συγγραφέας πλατειάζει είτε την παραμικρή κόπωση ακόμα και στα κείμενα εκείνα που δεν εμπίπτουν στα άμεσα ενδιαφέροντά του. Η Le Guin έχει…διαβρώσει λογοτεχνικά τις σελίδες, προσφέροντάς μας μια συλλογή που ενεργοποιεί αυτούς τους περίφημους κυματισμούς στο μυαλό (ο φερώνυμος τίτλος εκπορευόμενος από τη Β. Γουλφ).\n",
      "Καταλήγοντας, ακόμα κι αν αυτό το «κύμα», όπως αδευτέρωτα το περιγράφει, αφορά τους συγγραφείς και τη δημιουργία έργων, δεν θα ήταν υπερβολή να πούμε ότι τα απόνερα της διαδικασίας αυτής συμπαρασύρουν τον αναγνώστη στη χώρα της φαντασίας όπου εξαίσια πλάσματα (όπως εκείνα της Le Guin) κατοικούν.\n",

      "This book has been the big elephant on my Goodreads 'Currently Reading' list, because the more accurate way to describe what I was doing with this book was avoiding, and not reading. I got about halfway through it and I just can't see the finish line. I just can't finish it. I really, really wanted to like it and I really, really wanted to finish it, but, alas, I cannot and I have to just face the fact that it won't happen. Every time I come back to it, I just get this really anxious feeling in the pit of my stomach and have to put it down again. I don't know if I can write a fair review if I haven't finished the book. Then again, the fact that I can't get to the end might speak for itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I first picked up the book I thought it was going to be a fun historical romance with a frustrating heroine who annoys the big bad Viking and gets foiled in her attempts at undermining him by her own desires and his prowess. I expected there to be some conflict. I expected there to be repercussions for some of the things that the heroine did. She wasn't exactly trying to be endearing and some of the things she said and did were not very well thought out. However, I felt that the punishments did not fit the crimes. I got through two such punishments, and they were both brutal and possibly emotionally damaging. Honestly, after the first one, I wasn't sure how the heroine was ever going to forgive the hero, especially considering her personal history and the fact that she said she wouldn't ever forgive him. The second punishment was publicly humiliating, physically painful, and hurtful, and it was all because of a misunderstanding. I just thought it was too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I couldn't make the mental leap from feuding couple - emotionally draining and physically painful (not in a fun kind of way) - to making love. Fucking. Whatever. I couldn't. I needed them to take time to repair the damage first. Especially because there was existing damage that wasn't repaired from punishment number one. I just needed a little bit more here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing that turned me off was the back and forth between the hero and heroine. The \"I love you, I love you not,\" and the \"Does s/he love me, does s/he love me not?\" I just felt like so much unpleasantness could have been avoided for them if only they just admitted their feelings for each other. I'm not saying it should have been super easy. I'm saying that it seemed to be super hard, maybe too hard. And maybe some people enjoy the suspense and the back and forth and the anxiety. But it is not to my taste, so I just had to put the book down and walk away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe I'm reading this through the eyes of a 21st century woman with a different concept of fair punishment as opposed to the medieval mindset that was a bit more brutal. But I am a 21st century woman, and this book was written for a 21st century audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writing itself was good. The sex scenes that I read were hot. The style just wasn't to my taste and there were too many issues that I just couldn't reconcile. Maybe other readers would enjoy this book and for that reason, I'm giving it two stars.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I was in the mood for something angsty, and since the Viking series on the History Channel, I've also been interested in reading/listening to something from that era. So, this book delivered on both fronts in this chemical romance through the melting together of Viking Hero, Brant (Lord Blackwell), the Flame, and his \"lady-wife\" Lady Della, the Cold-hearted.\n",
      "\n",
      "As previous reviewers have indicated, you will feel a myriad of emotions on this medieval journey of love. It is an emotional, roller-coaster especially for the values of a 21st century listener! Yet, through the many tumultuous emotions that encompassed the experience of this book, overall, I was rooting for a fabulous HEA for both Brant and Della.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is about a very conflicted relationship between a couple from different cultures who go through many misunderstandings because they don't share all of their feelings, they speak too harshly and can't take things back due to pride. Della, herself has one of the most sharp-tongues I've witnessed from a heroine. She says awful things to Brant that come very close to fruition. And, even though, most of the time, Brant was the more patient of the pair, he was ruthless in his treatment of his wife (even though he felt remorseful). In this era, it was what was expected. In fact, with all of the brut power and force of the law on the husband's side, it's amazing how much influence and control Della actually held in her manor and with her husband. She is a very strong heroine, despite her shrewish flaws. But, there's always a reason behind the way people act, and Della definitely has a reason for her prejudice and hatred of Vikings. Brant understood this and seemed to really exert effort in making his marriage work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the tumult, I kept listening because I couldn't stop. Also, the steamy romances between the two was really good. I just wish there was more coverage of the blissful and light moments between the lovers because when they loved it was amazing…..they loved almost as passionately as they fought. Unfortunately, the end felt very rushed and it did not fully make up for the dramatic, violence that preceded it. For this reason there should have been an epilogue. On the positive side, thankfully, there is a resolution to their issues. This story may have a lot of emotionally, crushing moments, but it is very well written. Let me tell you Michelle Pillow really knows how to tell a story, no matter how steamy or chilling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, I thought the narrator was excellent. Mason Loyd did a great job in narrating both the masculine, Viking voices as well as the ladies.\n",

      "This is an indispensable guide to anyone considering writing haiku in English (or reading it, for that matter). Well-written, straightforward, lacking jargon, filled with examples, this book is about all things haiku: its history and development, how English poets use it, how to write it, how to appreciate it. As the author says in his introduction, “The writing of a haiku is a smooth process of rather short duration, but I have 'deconstructed' the art into a series of independent subjects to be analyzed separately.” Chapter headings include “Haiku Grammar,” “Poetic Devices,” and “Why Edit?” for example. On my copy there’s an endorsement on the back of the book from Lawrence Ferlinghetti: “Wow! Breath of the Buddha!”\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "It is difficult to imagine a guide into the world of modern English-language haiku better than Lee Gurga. For the merely curious, Haiku: A Poet's Guide is a concise history of haiku and a clear explanation of what makes a strong haiku in modern English; for the beginning haiku poet, it is the perfect textbook complete with masterful illustrations of the form and critical analyses of how they are constructed; and for the experienced poet, it not only reinforces the foundations of the craft but also theorizes on the future of English-language haiku, asking many important questions about the significance of haiku and how it might transform in the 21st century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gurga not only provides excellent haiku examples throughout the many detailed sections of the book, but he also shows how those poems could have been much worse by intentionally rewriting them with mistakes (usually added words and/or a rearrangement of words/lines) to illustrate particular points that he wants to teach. This is a smart approach, allowing the reader to easily compare good and bad choices with various techniques. The book is also well-researched, quoting other poets and haiku scholars throughout, and providing countless insights into related genres and theoretical approaches to the form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toward the end of the book, Gurga states that he espouses a particular style of haiku--he leans more toward traditional methods when it comes to seasonal references, the juxtaposition of two images, and avoiding figurative language--but he also admits that there is room for experimentation and other methods that can stretch the boundaries of the form, providing some examples like a minimalist poem from Cor van den Heuvel and a concrete poem from Carolyn Hall. A further exploration of haiku experimentation and the Modernist movement of the 20th century might have been enlightening for readers with an avant-garde bent. However, that is outside this guide's scope, and the book more than adequately fulfills its intended purpose as an insightful introduction to the haiku form as a whole. On the cover, van den Heuvel himself calls this \"an important book,\" and I agree that it is an essential text for anyone wanting to make the most of reading, understanding, and writing haiku.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This book felt beyond where I am as a writer at this point, but even so I got a lot out of it. So much here that is good advice for all poets plus a really good dive into what it really means to write haiku...which includes changing how you look at the world around you. So glad I read this.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "One of the best guides to writing haiku that I have read thus far.\n",

      "I read this book to learn some things about Ireland as we are soon going on a trip there.\n",
      "I learned a lot about the Potato Famine. Apparently, Great Britain had a lot of negligence in the 1,000,000 deaths due to the potato fungus that affected the potatoes. Britain had laws and attitudes that caused many of the people to be without food. It was interesting to note that the Irish exported food to the wealthy British during the famine.\n",
      "Ireland was certainly subjugated as an inferior race by the British. It is good now that Ireland is independent. They are doing well now.\n",

      "The Bible!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are a competitive player of the game of Bridge, you should consider this book to be your Bible for advice concerning how best to defend against suit contracts. The information to be found within should be indisputable. Why? Because it is not opinion! Because it is not a collection of old wives’ tales! Because it is not the view of some so-called expert or another. Because it is a collection of many thousands of computer simulations that actually calculate the best results for the opening leads of defenders, regardless of the most commonly used scoring methods used in our games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authors David Bird and Taf Anthias present the optimum opening leads using both IMP and Matchpoint scoring methods, and they carry their results to two decimal places. In their research and analysis, the authors generated millions of hands that matched the possible holdings for the defender sitting in the West seat when North and South were in various suit contracts right up to, and including, grand slams. They selected and analyzed the five thousand that most accurately reflected the bidding and the holdings of cards by the players. Then, they generated additional hands to show how small changes in the bidding, or in West’s hand, might dramatically change the preferred opening lead. They point out the importance of paying attention to opponents’ bidding in order to make the best leads.\n",
      "\n",
      "The contents of this book are not opinions. They are statistically- and mathematically-proven facts — facts that will probably surprise some readers and players. Take, for example, the opening lead of an unsupported Ace. Is it ever a good idea? You have probably been taught that it is not — that the purpose of Aces is to capture Kings. Guess what?! That’s bad advice! An Often, when defending against suit contracts at any levels, the lead of an unsupported Ace will provide the best results for defenders.\n",
      "\n",
      "What if the opponents are in a slam contract? Is it ever right to lead the Dummy’s known long/strong suit? You bet! The authors have calculated the probabilities that your partner might have a trick in that suit, and sometimes it is the best lead you can make.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not late-night, easy and relaxing reading. It is a textbook. It is dry but is also chock full of information that serious players of the game will find useful. Study the material within and you will certainly win more matches and games. My copy of the book is now heavily highlighted and underlined, as well as being rife with post-it note flags. Yup. It looks like a heavily used textbook, and that’s just what it now is.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the best book on defensive Bridge play that I have ever seen, and I highly recommend it. I award all five of the available five stars with my advice to purchase it and begin studying.\n",

      "Wald's focus is the night Dylan took the stage at the 1965 Newport Jazz/Folk festival, backed by most of the Paul Butterfield Blues band, and \"electrified one half his audience and electrocuted the other.\" Newport principally had been acoustic (and, if not, featured only electrified ethnic folk music, e.g., Cajun). But Dylan cranked the volume up to \"11\". It is true, as described in Alex Ross's book on 20th Century music, and the surviving film (turned into a brilliant documentary by Scorsese) that Pete Seeger charged up to the mixing board demanding the noise be reduced--but was told there were enough other Newport Festival Board members to overrule him.\n",
      "\n",
      "More interesting is the tale of the axe--that Pete Seeger wanted to take down the power to the electric instruments. Seeger himself admitted, in an autobiography, saying, \"Damn, if I had an axe I'd cut the cable right now.\" But this may be a post-hoc invention: Wald closely listens to the film soundtrack, and hears \"Leave that one alone, Pete [Seeger],\" at almost the same time Peter Yarrow says, referring to Dylan, not Seeger, and using a jazz musician's metaphor for guitar, \"He's gonna get his axe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There's no question that some, maybe as much as half, of the Newport audience booed the Dylan/Butterfield electric set. But why? Two reasons: the impromptu group played badly, having rehearsed only once (the night before); and the sound mix was awful--those in front could hear only the amplified instruments, not Dylan's voice: you had to be in the back half of the lawn to know Dylan existed at all. So at least some of those booing may have been frustrated about missing their idol entirely (at least until he was persuaded to return for two solo acoustic numbers).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Newport '65 became a time to take sides:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"[T]he audience had to make a clear-cut choice and they made it…They were choosing suffocation over invention and adventure, backwards over forwards, a dead hand over a live one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Theodore Bikel put it in a nutshell:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'You don't whistle in church--you don't play rock and roll at a folk festival.' For that analogy to hold, Newport has to be the church: the quiet, respectable place where people knew how to act. Pete Seeger was the parson. The troubled fans were the decent, upstanding members of the community. And Dylan was the rebellious young man who whistled.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Or, to personify that era, it was not Dylan who was transformed; it was Seeger. [The audience] could chose the past or the future, and they chose Seeger. It was not news that Dylan was the future; the news was that Seeger was the past.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other side, a young audience member -- clearly unfamiliar with Seeger's persistent Communist connections (Seeger apologized for Stalin only in the 1990s) -- said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All the martyrdom blather about blacklisting and guitars killing fascists and trailing Woody Guthrie around like a puppy faded to zero for me when Seeger took the stage to try to enforce his hootenanny, Sing Out version of what music should be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, to simplify it still further, it must have driven Seeger mad that although \"[i]t was not impossible to sing along with a rock band, but it was irrelevant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Wald concludes -- anticipating, wrongly I think with respect to the break between New and Old Left, Altimont by a few years -- \"the confrontation at Newport marked the end of the folk boom and the arrival of rock as a mature art form, the break of the New Left from the old, and the triumph of the counterculture.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Dylan made it clear he didn't care: \"You go your way/I'll go mine.\" Seeger seems to have simultaneously admired and despised that attitude.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dylan Goes Electric!: Newport, Seeger, Dylan, and the Night that Split the Sixties, by Elijah Wald, is a stool on three legs. It's the story of early Bob Dylan, his art and commerce, it's the story of the Newport Folk Festival during the period when it gave the imprimatur to politically conscious sixties pop music, and it's also the story of Pete Seeger, who was as much the founder of the Newport festival as anyone, and who was accepted as the conscience of the festival by both those who agreed with him and those who didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides this tripod of Dylan-Newport-Seeger, there are other stories running through this book, for instance the start of the so-called British Invasion, which brought American folk and blues music back home, performed by British performers. Ironically, this wave of British musicians inspired by traditional American artists had the effect of smothering the folk music renaissance of the early 1960s.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a tension running through this history—between folk music vs. pop, amateur vs. professional,\n",
      "singer-songwriters who performed their own work vs. traditionalists who kept the “people's music” alive, and supposedly “honest” folk singers like Leadbelly vs. what Dave van Ronk called the “Babbitt balladeers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wald looks at Dylan's early career as a songwriter and examines the changing ideology of his work. It's not anything as superficial as going from Left to Right. Just as he did in his earlier books, Escaping the Delta: Robert Johnson and the Invention of the Blues, and How the Beatles Destroyed Rock 'n' Roll: An Alternative History of American Popular Music, Wald uses sales figures to see what songs were actually popular when.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wald details the origin of the Newport Folk Festival and describes how it was organized (or disorganized). We learn who played and what they performed and why they picked what they did. Some decisions were motivated by art and some by popularity. And some decisions were motivated by greed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The battles weren't only between the old-timers and the new pop royalty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some traditionalists, like the ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax, wanted to bring the audience up to a level that would appreciate the perfection of musicians who had been playing this music their whole lives. Some others like Pete Seeger (also traditionalists) were more interested in the political effect of getting a country full of amateurs strumming their guitars and banjos to resist the evils of society.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Seeger himself saw this problem—making a connection between the people and artists—a generation before, when he was trying to bring political music to labor unions: music doesn't have a lot to do with pork chops.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are still probably contradictory memories of what happened the night Bob Dylan fronted the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and played Stratocaster, I think Elijah Wald has investigated and answered the meaningful questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't just Dylan who went electric. It was the whole world of popular music.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there hadn't been musicians and songwriters who were inspired by both traditional folksingers and the sound of electric guitars and amps, there would have been no Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, no Laura Nyro, no Simon and Garfunkel, no John Prine, no Janis Ian, no Cat Stevens, no Dan Fogelberg, no Judy Collins, no Jackson Browne.\n",
      "\n",
      "First we needed the Byrds singing Dylan's “Mr. Tambourine Man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "More interesting than the rock history gossip is Wald's analysis of what it all meant. He sees it not as a struggle between old and new dreams, between Seeger and Dylan, between the Old Left and the New, but rather a struggle between two old dreams, between ideals of community and the individual, a conflict that's inherent in this country and that's still being fought.\n",

      "I received this ARC from Dey Street Books and Elijah Wald. Thank you for allowing me to read this excellent book!\n",
      "\n",
      "This book was extremely long (350 pages) and does a little back and forth time jumping through the years of the Newport Folk and Jazz Festivals, but all in all it was an excellent read, and by the end you feel like a spectator of The Night that Split the Sixties. And you will appreciate your understanding of the rolls of many other personalities involved the the resurgence of Folk music during the fifties and sixties. Dylan is no less enigmatic when you finish the book than he was before you started, but that is as it should be. Altogether an excellent look into a world of often forgotten entertainers, and a memory jolt for those of us who during that era 'found' folk music, jazz and blues, and cling to it still.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A truly superb rendering of the intersection of the folk music scene of the 1960s and rock and roll music, and a terrific look at the music and career of Bob Dylan at that time. This book is an essential for fans of rock music history and roots music.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I enjoyed this story of Dylan’s folk concert surprise. Wald opens with a tease of the event to be fully described later – Dylan rocking. The author then dives into the history behind the event, with extensive bios of Dylan and Pete Seeger, name dropping dozens of others in the folk firmament in the late 50s and early 60s. Wald covers the business aspects, including concert promoting, as well as the music aspects. I found the variety of perspectives really helped set the stage for what was to follow – the night at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 when Dylan broke the code and played rock and roll, backed by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. In the frantic description of the concert, perhaps it was Dylan backing Butterfield. Nevertheless, things changed for Dylan and for folk music, as the prince moved on to conquer larger fields. I most enjoyed the stories of concert promoting, especially from the folk music collective, which isn’t a subject I’ve read a lot about. I also enjoyed a story I have read before, Dylan becoming Dylan. Here, there seems to be more direct quotes from sources including film. This has more of a feeling of immediacy than other Dylan-focused books I’ve read. I also enjoyed the descriptions of the focus of the book, the concert. There is a lot of back-stage intrigue, yet what exactly happened is not recorded. Wald weaves a narrative, explaining where he’s making conjectures and what he’s basing them on. This was nice work making a readable story of a confusing event where new paths in popular music were set.\n",

      "Mike Bartlett proves once again to not only being one of the most provocatively versatile and witty contemporary playwrights, but a master craftsman as well. His 'faux' Shakespearean history play, lampooning the current Windsors, is a master stroke in blank verse and iambic pentameter, with Diana making an appearance as a Ghost and ambitious Kate becoming a Lady MacBeth figure to ensure her husband's & son's legacies.\n",
      "\n",
      "On 2nd reading: Although less than 2 years have passed since my initial reading, I wanted to re-read this upon having seen the recent PBS adaptation, which unfortunately truncated the play quite a bit, cutting about a third of it, and subtly changing the ending. The play still holds up quite well, and seeing it laid out on the page actually adds to one's appreciation ... although there is something to be said for seeing it performed also. Am curious whether history will be kind to the play, once real events catch up to Bartlett's imagined fabrication.\n",

      "I have to say that, purely as an American who took some comfort during the Trump years that at least the British had Boris, it would be wildly entertaining to see Act 3 Scene 6 of this play happen in real life on the telly (as the British say), where Charles the Third pulls a William the Fourth card, smugly marching in and dissolving Parliament with his kingly scept(r)er. Perhaps then, with our Great British Allies suffering a constitutional crisis as well, America’s looming woes of the Electoral Count Act and variety wouldn’t feel as lonely. Lol.\n",
      "\n",
      "After listening to by both the Choir of King’s College, Cambridge and the Sex Pistols (both sides what what), I found this play today while Googling “King Charles III.” I was impressed that a play originally published in 2014 was so on point in predicting the news headlines following Elizabeth II’s death. Just like the Washington Post, BBC, etc., Paul the kebab truck guy in Act 3 Scene 5 says:\n",

      "It does strike me that on the freedom of press bill at issue in this play, Chucky Number 3 was in the right. Hence does monarchy, “the Albion oak… sown in British soil,” uphold liberal democracy….\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, at any rate, it is interesting how Charles’s stance on the freedom of speech issue and his desire to be active is mirrored in his reaction to Harry’s desire to renounce his status as prince to marry Jess (another impressive fest of prescience on the author’s part) while William, the younger and more in-touch royal ends up opposing Harry and Jess even as he supports through regal inaction the censorious law. It’s an intriguing dimension to the play. Who’d you rather, Charles or William? The latter is definitely no better than the former in this play, and possibly quite worse. Neither, you say? Not an option!\n",

As per usual with plays in general and Shakespearean-type stuff in particular, reading the script does it no justice. Hearing different voices in the roles and seeing it done properly made all the difference here. Since Harry's marriage to Meghan the window of plausibility for the play has essentially closed, but it remains an intriguing piece nonetheless. Only time will tell...\n",

      "I bought this book a few years ago when looking for information on dancing in church. I attend a Messianic congregation and dancing is a part of our worship. Although the author of this book is from a different tradition, it still fit. I think this is a good book for anyone to read who is interested in being a part of any ministry, not necessarily dancing. I like how she focused on the indewelling of the Holy Spirit and how your thoughts and actions interfere with your ability to minister.\n",

      "This is the third book in the 'Inside Out' series and as much as I've enjoyed the series, I have to say that this book didn't hold quite the same level of intrigue for me. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, but it wasn't great like the first two books. Maybe it's just me, but the series is losing some of the appeal for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "After getting the answers to the questions surrounding Rebecca's disappearance in the second book, having many of those questions resurface in this book just seemed unnecessary. It seemed a bit like beating a dead horse to me. I was happy to have closed that chapter in this story and didn't want any doubt being cast. Can't a girl just have some closure!\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the earlier books in this series, this book is set in Paris. Sara decided to follow Chris and give their relationship a chance. As his past collides with their present, Sara must face her own insecurities, as well as a couple of women from his past that are determined to break them apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time around, some of the secrets that haunt Chris finally come to light. While I enjoyed seeing Chris and Sara come into their own as a couple, I found the big secrets to be anticlimactic. No big shockers here. I was left thinking, \"Really? That's it?\".\n",

We were about to film a pilot when covid hit. So if you still want to see it made, remind everyone how much! Tell the world about the sale and share, share, share! Remind them this project is still important! TEN YEARS it's been in Hollywood with so many almost-there stories. I'd need a big drink to tell you all the ways it's ALMOST been done.

      "One day I was a high school teacher on summer break, leading a relatively uneventful but happy life. Or so I told myself. Later, I’d question that, as I would question pretty much everything I knew about me, my relationships, and my desires. It all began when my neighbor thrust a key to a storage unit at me. She’d bought it to make extra money after watching some storage auction show. Now she was on her way to the airport to elope with a man she barely knew, and she needed me to clear out the unit before the lease expired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, I was standing inside a small room that held the intimate details of another woman’s life, feeling uncomfortable, as if I was invading her privacy. Why had she let these items so neatly packed, possessions that she clearly cared about deeply, be lost at an auction? Driven to find out by some unnamed force, I began to dig, to discover this woman’s life, and yes, read her journals—dark, erotic journals that I had no business reading. Once I started, I couldn’t stop. I read on obsessively, living out fantasies through her words that I’d never dare experience on my own, compelled by the three men in her life, none of whom had names. I read onward until the last terrifying dark entry left me certain that something had happened to this woman. I had to find her and be sure she was okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before long, I was taking her job for the summer at the art gallery, living her life, and she was nowhere to be found. I was becoming someone I didn’t know. I was becoming her.\n",

      "The dark, passion it becomes…\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I am working at a prestigious gallery, where I have always dreamed of being, and I’ve been delivered to the doorstep of several men, all of which I envision as one I’ve read about in the journal. But there is one man that will call to me, that will awaken me in ways I never believed possible. That man is the ruggedly sexy artist, Chris Merit, who wants to paint me. He is rich and famous, and dark in ways I shouldn’t find intriguing, but I do. I so do. I don’t understand why his dark side appeals to me, but the attraction between us is rich with velvety promises of satisfaction. Chris is dark, and so are his desires, but I cannot turn away. He is damaged beneath his confident good looks and need for control, and in some way, I feel he needs me. I need him.\n",
      "\n",
      "All I know for certain is that he knows me like I don’t even know me, and he says I know him. Still, I keep asking myself — do I know him? Did he know her, the journal writer, and where is she? And why doesn’t it seem to matter anymore? There is just him and me, and the burn for more.\n",

      "Review 1\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Raymond Smullyan is famed to be a philosopher, logician, mathematician, musician, magician, humorist, writer, and maker of marvelous puzzles, and all these aspects and interests come forth in various chapters of the book, which follows on in his unique tradition of parodying great works of popular fiction. As the author says, “This book, like Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There, is truly for readers of all ages. By this I do not mean that all of it is for every age, but for every age, some of it is for that age.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of his famous works include where the indefatigable duo of Holmes and Watson is enlisted to solve strange conundrums and where is called upon to give the puzzles some good twists. The real beauty of the book is how similar the characters feel to the originals, not only in talk and behavior, but also in the word plays and their convoluted logic and paradoxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The puzzles do increase in difficulty as the book goes along, but the sheer delight at the inventiveness and playfulness of the author keeps us going with breaks only to think or to laugh. So even as the Duchess prompts Alice with “As to puzzles, these are nothing compared to some I tell you if I chose!”, we are far from Alice’s feigned indifference as she says, “Oh, you needn't choose!\" as politely as she could.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is a fun book of math, logic, and philosophical puzzles. The joy for me came from Smullyan's ability to channel Lewis Carroll. He used the characters, humor, and story lines from Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass to great effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not, however, a math, logic, nor philosophy book. The answers are given in the back, along with a brief explanation of how the answer was reached. It doesn't explain the math/logic etc. I would have liked to have had more of an explanation of how to set up the problem-solving. Because I'm that kind of a nerd who doesn't understand higher math.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Raymond Smullyan is my Logician Dumbledore. I own and read every book of his I can get my hands on. Which is well over a dozen.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Pretty sure the way the author came up with many of these \"puzzles\" is by taking some pure logic statements (I don't know logic): A^B>C+A. Then scrambling these statements using logic rules: ABAB&CA^>>Q. Then translating this into a story with Alice in Wonderland names. It is honestly uninspired and the resulting puzzles are inelegant and just painful to think about. There is just no respect to the \"non-mathematical\" story part of these logic scenarios: why should every member of a hearts club love every woman not in the hearts club? why does Humpty Dumpty sneakily change the established definition of \"liar\" that has been used half the book? Because it served the weird, twisted mathematical bowl of spaghetti that is the backbone of the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many problems require \"brute-force\" solutions wherein you must check every possible case and make tables out of said cases. While this may be a useful homework exercise for a logic class, it's not elegant like actually fun riddles are. And I'm certainly not going to waste my time solving these problems just because I read them in a fanfic about a book inside a book about an insane drug land. The mystery of the \"tarts,\" surrree.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least the character and style well-replicates its inspiration. It may even be worth a read just because of that. This is in the spirit of the originals, of course. And this is as close to a sequel as you'll get. Wonderland is a dream world, when the brain is encased in darkness with nothing to do but play \"logic\" with itself and extrapolate on its knowledge, so it makes sense that the next book in the series would be like it is, another logic book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than that, my reason for reading (which is certainly not for these \"puzzles\") is the dual purpose of the narrative: story and riddle. This is relevant to my attempts at such metafiction where the narrative is at once both story and an outline of game mechanics. I have a talent for this and have done in the past a dry yet humorous news article, and a story that doubled as an app to an exclusive community. The book does a mediocre job at this at some points. One whole chapter the queens randomly decide to give Alice an exam, and in another the king recites a whole book about logic puzzles he once read. Most of the book is just Wonderland characters unabashedly telling each other logic puzzles, unfortunately.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite chapters were the few ones without the puzzles, of course, and with just narrative. Toward the end, there are some of these chapters that explore some very strange, complex logical curiosities in the same spirit as \"Godel, Escher, Bach\" (another strong follower of Carroll!), however with significantly less clarity (not as well explained) and also just plain absurd and purposeless. I will admit, though, the setup and structure of the ending puzzle, which was about Alice dreaming about herself, was pretty cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would only recommend this book to Carroll fans or mental masochists.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "La Dover ha da poco ristampato, come sua abitudine a prezzo abbordabile, uno dei tanti libri di Raymond Smullyan, matematico noto per essere uno dei principali esponenti della corrente \"esperti di problemi di logica\". In questa sua opera, come dice il nome stesso, Smullyan si ispira ai libri di Lewis Carroll con protagonista Alice: i problemi hanno pertanto come personaggi il Cappellaio Matto, la Lepre Marzolina, lo Jabberwocky, il Cavaliere Bianco, Humpty Dumpty e via discorrendo. Smullyan è delizioso e molto carrolliano nel testo: ma lo dice anche nel sottotitolo, \"una storia carrolliana per bambini fino a ottant'anni\". Insomma è un piacere leggerlo anche senza darsi la pena di risolvere i problemi: questo va benone per uno come me che dopo un po' si ingarbuglia nelle definizioni. Per esempio, la \"logica attraverso lo specchio\", con la differenza tra quello che si crede esser vero e quello che è vero, dopo un po' fa venire il mal di testa.. Tanto per cambiare, ci sono anche un paio di capitoli di \"problemi per cui non serve l'algebra\", semplici problemi aritmetici che possono per l'appunto essere risolti con un po' di attenzione e di conti ma senza dover scrivere un sistema di equazioni. Lettura insomma piacevole.\n",

      "My Body, My Self for Girls is a great book for girls in the 9-14 year-old age range who want to learn more about the changes they can expect in their bodies during puberty, and for the parents or other adults who will be raising them through it. This book is written in a very easy-to-understand, conversational style that is fully accessible to it's target audience. I really liked that the authors frequently reassure girls that everything they are going through is perfectly normal and natural, and that they should be happy with their bodies just the way they are and not feel embarrassed about the things they are experiencing. mainly covers the basics of the physical changes a girl can expect when going through puberty such as growth spurts, breast and pubic hair growth, and “The Big M,” menstruation. The book does include detailed line drawings of the naked female body including both the internal sex organs and external genitalia. In my opinion however, it is all quite age appropriate, as there is nothing included about boys or sexuality, except for a couple of brief mentions of masturbation. The authors' companion book, , covers those types of issues, but I will probably wait a couple more years before giving it to my currently 11 year-old daughter until she has matured a bit more. Of course, this is just my opinion and every parent has their own ideas about the age at which it is appropriate to share such things.\n",
      "\n",
      "also contains lots of fun, interactive activities including quizzes, games, questionnaires and journaling exercises. There are some good ice-breaking questions to help open the channels of communication between girls and their parents or other adult role model in their lives to discuss the ofttimes difficult topic of puberty, and suggestions for getting a parent to open up when they seem embarrassed or unwilling to talk about it. Overall, I found to be a very informative book. In spite of being a mom with 40 years of experience to back me up, I was still able to learn a couple of things from it that I didn't previously know. All I can say is that I wish this book or one like it had been around when I was my daughter's age and that my mom had given it to me. can be used as a companion workbook for , or the two books can be read separately.\n",

      "This is Part III in the Mickey Tussler Series. My full review is full review is forthcoming in The Rockford Review, which will be released later this month. For now I will quickly write that it was wonderful to reunite with my friends Mickey, Murphy, Molly, and Lester. I'm also glad I got to get acquainted with Jolene.\n",
      "\n",
      "So here's what's going on:\n",
      "\n",
      "Mickey is still pitching, but he's in the Big Leagues now. Most of this story takes place in Boston, which is cool. We also visit Milwaukee, Indiana, and New York for professional and personal purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Murphy and Molly are making progress with their relationship and Mickey has a girlfriend now, Jolene. Once I recovered from the shock that Jolene carries a rabbit's foot with her for good luck, I was able to accept her for being a good listener with a kind heart. I still can't believe anyone ever thought carrying a rabbit's foot was a good idea, let alone a good luck charm. I, like Mickey, love rabbits as pets. Anyway, moving on:\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some wonderful, joyful moments as well as sickening ones. Nappi has written suspense into the games as well as the relationships very well. As someone who doesn't watch or play baseball, I still enjoyed this book. Nappi gives baseball virgins a peek at baseball's backstage and baseball's colorful language. Example: I know what \"twin killings\" means in baseball because of this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed this book very much. I enjoy all the characters I've mentioned, but was especially enchanted by the strength and thoughtfulness of Molly. I am already looking forward to the fourth installment. But before that happens, please know this book releases in early April BUT you may preorder it now through Amazon.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "It's unusual to say that a third book of a series stands well on its own and doesn't really require the support or a prior knowledge of the others, but Welcome to the Show is such as production, adding to the Mickey Tussler series about an autistic baseball prodigy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Set in the 1950s, this baseball saga continues the story of Mickey's rise to fame and connects major league playing with life's challenges in such a way that even non-baseball fans will find Mickey's progress absorbing (although baseball enthusiasts will be the most likely followers of Mickey's on- and off-field exploits.).\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank Nappi's attention to detail and his honest appraisal of the times pulls no punches, so readers anticipating a light or breezy coverage of autism and social issues of the 1950s will find plenty of passages more detailed than might be anticipated from a casual baseball saga.\n",
      "\n",
      "The protagonists in Welcome to the Show clearly reveal their thoughts, hopes, and worries. Some are specific to Mickey's condition and others are more general expressions, but all psychological revelations hold food for thought and a depth unexpected for a 'baseball story': another reason why Welcome to the Show is notable when compared to other books about either autism or sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "From encounters with prejudice about special needs in society to games that teach Mickey about life, Welcome to the Show is about achievement against all odds and the ripple effect of a game that spills into life experience, ethics, and psychological growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "So many factors entwine here that it's difficult to say Welcome to the Show is about any singular person or event. It is ultimately about the game of life itself, and continues a powerful series (prior books not seen by this reviewer) by exploring the evolution of this process, using a focus that any reader - baseball fan or not - can easily understand.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Ever wonder what it’s like to manage a major league baseball team? The book Welcome To The Show: A Mickey Tussler Novel by Frank Nappi is about a Man named Murphy that manages baseball for the minor league Brewers and moves up to the Major league team Boston Red Socks. Making this journey with his autistic baseball prodigy Mickey Tussler. Mickey is one of the more important characters in this book as well. He goes on to have all of his difficulties being autistic with this new baseball group. Especially after there was a spark of intressed from one the team members' sister in Mickey. Mickey and Murphy are very close though and it helps that Mickey’s mom Molly is Murphy’s Girlfriend too. Molly and Murph have their problems as well as all couples do. The biggest mission is to be welcomed into the team for these two new members.\n",
      "This is a great book. There is just enough going on at all times to keep on turning for more pages. It sure does help to enjoy the sport of baseball though, understanding some of this book definitely helps having some baseball knowledge as well. My favorite part of the book is right around the climax and it really feels like the weight of the world is being lifted.\n",
      "During the reading of this book it really felt as though the problems were real and the reader had to fix them, almost as if they were the manager themselves. If you like reading about baseball or especially if you like the Red Socks I’d suggest reading this book. I give this book an 9 out of 10.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Mickey Tussler is a rookie phenom with a difference: he's autistic, and is getting his first taste of the big leagues and the big city when he's called up to the Boston Braves for the 1950 season. Althought it's the third book in a series, it easily stands alone as it details a storybook season and the unique perspectives of Mickey, his father-figure coach, his mother, his teammates and a special someone who becomes enchanted with the star pitcher. All necessary backstory is clearly detailed, and the narration has all the charms of a classic baseball raconteur.\n",
      "\n",
      "** I received a complimentary copy of this from the publisher for consideration in ALAN's Under the Radar column **\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A middle-of-the-road tale of an autistic pitcher and his stepfather leading the Boston Braves in 1950 with family, relationship, and racial challenges popping up along the way. The third in a trilogy, this book referenced a number of events out of context that occurred in previous novels, and was married by its overly pedantic and prosaic style. However, it's a solid YA novel for baseball lovers who are interested in the game's history.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "The story in this book was pretty good – a few recent Thor books I have not cared for the story as much as his earlier books. However, as always, the story serves only as a thin veil for Thor’s soap box. While I do find his approach to certain topics a bit extreme at times, I enjoy political thrillers and his are very readable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will say that one of Thor’s most common themes is torturing the bad guys for info. If you don’t like descriptions of torture, than you should probably stay away from this and other Thor books. Another theme that he touches on A LOT is that he is not a fan of religious extremists and his terrorists almost always come from this group. You can probably get what I am hinting at while I stay as politically correct as possible in my review! So, be aware that this is in the content if you decide to try Thor out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do like how Thor has carried the story line from book to book. While each story stands alone, he always ends them in a way that is a seamless transition into the next book. I have gotten to know and see the development of his characters throughout the series and it is nice to get back to them every time I pick up the next book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Action packed but controversial – definitely might make some uncomfortable. But, if you like political thrillers and need an easy read, you can’t go wrong with Thor.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I keep forgetting brad thor has gone off the deep end on politicl policy. Use to just write good thrillers but now he writes wacko right wing commentary. Too bad. Couldn't get past first few chapters before he started in on the benefits of torture and those opposed being communists. Then onto the theory that the country is under attack by liberals as if we were inches away from becoming another cuba? No, china? No. France, that's it's. Hard to believe when we have become more conservative than ever before.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I think I'm done reading books by Brad Thor.\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoy espionage and covert ops genre novels, especially because I believe it's a complex world and I respect the patriots who put their lives on the line on our behalf trying to protect our liberties and our community.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Thor's novels are increasingly filled with not-so-subtle caricatures of liberals and Democrats as teetering on the edge of terrorism and anarchy themselves. If I have to choose a political camp, it is the liberal/Democratic one. I do believe that there are other Americans of good conscience and true patriotism who are conservative/Republican. I also believe that the health of our democracy depends upon holding respectful tensions of our differences. And what fundamentally threatens our democracy is any extreme that can't allow for the differences in Americans' beliefs, including political and economic values. But Thor seems to \"get\" this less and less.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the caricatures of Muslims are even more disturbing. In a few places, Thor acknowledges that there might be Muslims of good faith. But the overall conclusion seems to be that there aren't enough of these persons of good faith to take on the bullies who have perverted that faith into an excuse for jihad against the West.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the use of such extreme torture, violence, and killing by a \"hero\" who works for a subcontractor for the US military is all too disturbing and chilling in its realism. For me, this raises a serious concern we Americans should have about the contractors who are doing this. Unconstrained by military chain of command and accountability, why should they have the authority to take these actions? I \"get it\" that terrorist cells require a different approach than do nation-based threats. Even so, the question of accountability and ethics looms large.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Great read. Scott Harvath is battling evil again, this time against a group aiming to systematically dismantle all that is taken for granted in the USA. The background of this effort can be summed up with this excerpt:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A democracy can only exist until the voters discover they they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From the moment that realization takes hold, history shows that the majority of the people will always vote for the candidate promising the most goodies from the public treasury.\n",
      "\n",
      "History also shows that once a democracy goes down this road, things never end well. Each and every time, the democracy collapses. It always happens. It collapses over loose fiscal policy, and democracy is always followed by dictatorship.\n",
      "\n",
      "When democracy collapses, fear, violence, and uncertainty fill the void. In essence it's chaos, and that what the dictator preys upon. The people are so terrified that they will agree to trade anything, even the most precious possession they have -- their liberty -- in exchange for a return to order. But, when order is restored, freedom is never seen by those citizens again.\"\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I love thrillers, and CIA thrillers especially. And while I enjoyed some of Thor's earlier Scot Harvath books, they've taken a sharp turn for the worse. Yes, Thor's Harvath has always been an ego-laden 'Mary Sue' character, Thor's wish-fullfillment. And, yes, the prose has always been basic. But the action used to be thrilling and, well, action-packed... and not bogged down with Thor's obvious, in-your-face, personal political agenda/propaganda. I know military books tend to have a right-wing bend, but this book went extreme. Thor crams his extreme political (and hypocritical at that) agenda down your throat in this book so hard it suffocates, gags...TORTURES. Being water-boarded would have been more enjoyable. He goes on and on and on...AND ON!... he comes completely out of the story and just rants (much of which is so unbelievably hypocritical and narrow minded it's embarrassing).\n",
      "\n",
      "Listen, I understand...Brad's frustrated with politics. Dude, many of us are. But fiction isn't where I want to get his agenda force-fed to me. He's lost me as a reader. I'm out.\n",

      "This is the third book in the series A land of Canaan. The story is about Danielle Kent and Levi Detweiler. It is such a sweet love story. Beth Wiseman has won me over and i will be reading a lot more books from her. This story made me smile, cry, made me mad (at Sarah and Vera -Levi's mother), and joyful for such a happy ending. I wish she would come out with a fourth one about Sarah and maybe Matthew together. But anyways i loved this book and this whole series.\n",

Honestly, if I had remembered that it was an Amish book (couldn't see the cover very well on my library's site & didn't bother reading the blurb because I was trying to hurry & I knew it was Christian fiction), I probably wouldn't have even given it a second thought. And I most likely wouldn't have finished it, except that it was the audiobook and I needed something to listen to at work and I couldn't find a different book to listen to. So yeah... I finished it and it wasn't a bad book, it's just not the type of book that I really like.\n",

      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Very good book. I liked both Levi and Danielle, though she had a fair amount of maturing to do in this book. When Danielle discovered she was pregnant, she was devastated when Matthew walked away from her and refused any responsibility. She went to Levi for comfort, since he had been her best friend since she had come to live there. Danielle is still very young emotionally. She had a crummy home life, where her mother abused her. She ran away and ended up living with Martha, an Englischer who lives in the Amish community. Levi offers to marry her, to raise the baby as his own and take care of her. At first she refuses, because she knows that it will cause him to be separated from his Amish faith. He convinces her to accept and they marry. Danielle has never learned how to cook or keep house and her first few weeks are pretty rough. She also has to cope with the fact that Levi's mother dislikes her and blames Danielle for luring Levi away. Danielle also has no faith in God which is hard for Levi to accept. Over the weeks of their marriage, Danielle starts to believe that maybe God does exist and has a plan for her life. With help from Martha and other friends in the community, Danielle learns how to cook and care for the house. When Danielle is put on bedrest when her pregnancy is threatened, Levi's mother steps in to help. This gives her and Danielle a chance to get to know each other and Vera soon comes to care for Danielle. She also helps Danielle learn about the Amish faith and about her own relationship with God. I also liked Levi and the way he wanted to help Danielle. He felt called to marry her even though he knew the problems it would cause. I loved his patience and the way that he wasn't a critical husband when Danielle was first learning her way around being married. I also loved the way he supported Danielle, even standing up to his strong-willed mother. His quiet faith also help Danielle grow in hers. I thought the ending was very well done, and very believable because the changes happened over a period of time.\n",

      "My original Level Zero audiobook review and many others can be found at Audiobook Reviewer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Level Zero” is a coming of age Literary Role Playing Game (LitRPG) story which is the first book in the NextWorld series.  The book is written by Jaron Lee Knuth and the audiobook is very well narrated by John Pirhalla.  The author has quite a few books under his belt, however this one appears to be the only book currently available, at the time of this review, in audiobook format.  I assume the author and narrator will be bringing the second book in the series (Spawn) to audio in the future.  If you enjoy young adult (YA) coming of age stories that have science fiction and gaming elements with an interesting Blade Runner look and feel, I believe you will like Level Zero.  Even though the book is the first in a series, I felt the story concluded quite well for the first in a series with the author giving us a view into what to expect in future books.  That is to say, this book could be read as a stand-alone novel without any cliff hangers or other aspects requiring you to read the other books in the series; but I would be surprised if you did not want too.  When binary numbers are used for the chapter titles, you know you are in for some computer gaming fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main character is a fifteen-year-old who lost one of his parents and is estranged from the other; who is a highly politically involved individual.  Our main character has a single friend in the world and they both enjoy putting all their time in to playing virtual reality games for escape.  Although it sounds similar to all the other dystopian coming of age books in the genre, the author is able to set his story apart by creating a rather unique and different world from the others.  In this story, the world outside of their living space is crumbling and becoming toxic.  However, the space outside is filled with cable and wires providing feeds for the ever-present virtual world; think of it as the Internet times ten.  A person is given a small physical living space for storage, sleeping and eating.  Each room also comes with a pod allowing a person to jack into the virtual world.  Food, Vitapaste, is provided in a protein paste format used to sustain everyone; yummy.  It is a rather grim and dirty world, and that is why so many want to escape to the ever-growing virtual world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything from meeting up with your friends, education, work, and even religion occurs in the virtual world.  The pods are programmed to terminate your virtual connection when food or sleep are required as a safety precaution.  The world has a very socialistic feel with the government running, providing and overseeing nearly everything.  When a new beta world is available to only a select few, our characters jump at being given the opportunity to join.  Once in the new game, things go from bad to worse as they become trapped with their only escape being to win the game.  This newly created world is exactly what one would expect from your standard fantasy RPG.  There are warriors, rogues, magic users, etc.  Everyone needs to also trust and depend on the others in their party to survive.  However, the author did a good job of crafting some new and unique weapons and upgrade options.  It helped give the book a different angle than so many others in the genre.  Think fantasy world blended with a few of the amenities of the modern world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me turn to the book’s characters.  I felt the characters were overall well rounded and had good interaction with one another.  I would have liked to have had some additional background on a few of the characters joining the party to help me better understand their actions.  Each of the major characters had some issues that needed to be resolved as well as trust needing to be built for the party to succeed at their task.  What complicates things even more is that the new beta program locks our unsuspected group in the virtual world where they will starve if they are unable to escape.  The security protocols have all been compromised and our characters must win or parish due to starvation.  This is where the main arc of the story picks up as they try all they can to escape the program and save their lives.  The book focuses mainly on friendships with light romantic elements included.  If I could change one thing, it would be the continued use of the word “Yo” by one of the party characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The books narration was done very well and I enjoy John Pirhalla voice.  I have listened to a few other books by this narrator including the Origin of F.O.R.C.E. series by Sam B. Miller II which I enjoyed quite a bit.  His voice is mellow and pleasant to listen too, yet he is able to also keep things exciting during scenes of intense action.  John was able to bring life and distinction to each of the main characters by giving them unique personalities and accents.  He even included a few audio extras that make the book come alive in audio format.  I do not recall any issues with the audio itself, only a professionally produced audiobook.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to give the author credit as I do not remember any use of vulgar language in the book, nor any over sexualized sections.  The book’s is designed to be read by younger audiences except from a few rather graphic scenes of violence.  The book also does not fully address the tension between parent and child, as with most Disney stories, but I was happy to see that this book can be read by younger audiences; who I think will enjoy it quite a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, if you like book in the LitRPG genre and you are wanting something a little bit different or unique, I would recommend you pick up Level Zero and give it a try.  Most books in this genre often contain vulgar language or adult subject matter, where this book does not.  It is a fun, interesting, yet rather dark view into the future of virtual reality.   And remember, make sure to brush your teeth after eat your Vitapaste before going to bed tonight!\n",

      "I picked this up when it was a free download on Amazon.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a very enjoyable book. Rich world building and a great cast of characters made me forget that this story about being trapped in an online video game probably isn't the most original idea. However, Knuth makes this story his own by the end with some clever twists and turns that I completely didn't expect. The action is fast paced and never leaves the reader bored.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I had any complaints it would be that the editing really slipped by the end of the book. Typos scatter the last few chapters especially. I would love to see this book picked up by a big publishing house, it's a great YA novel with a lot of promise and was a lot of fun to read.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I understand what Mr Knuth was trying to accomplish with this narrative. While the plot twist was neither original nor unpredictable, it really wasn't the point of this story. In fact, while reading I was thinking this book would warrant a 1 or 2 star rating. It took a long time to get anywhere and seemed to be too meandering. I figured that's because it was book one of a series and we weren't going to get a conclusion. But no, this book stands alone just fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, the book earned 3 stars from me because as a book about the emotional growth of the main character it succeeded rather well. The growth seemed well earned and didn't come out if nowhere. I have no desire to read the next book, but I'm glad I enjoyed this one in the end.\n",

      "Basically a tongue in cheek ethnography of the people on the bleeding edge of technology circa 1995. Totally adorable in a dorky kind of way and kind of like a time capsule, full of praise for things like beepers and blazing fast 14.4k modems. They insist that smileys are lame and passé and on the way out, and that people who surf the web instead of using BBSes or IRC or USENET are \"bourgeois\" and totally lame. I wonder how they currently feel about emojis and the fact that most people now think that the world wide web is the entire internet.\n",

      "I was pleased to see that I'd read all of the top recommended cyberpunk books they listed. Every single website they recommended, on the other hand, is now defunct. It's curious that as a self-identified branch of punk, they eschew drinking, drugs, tattoos, and piercings, all of which they explicitly call stupid. Also curious, they seem to mistake furries for people into bestiality, a distinction that any seasoned netizen would recognize instantly, even back in 1995.\n",

I loved how they referenced to Beavis and Butthead's the anarchy sign on the side of the house. Then, I really enjoyed the jokes about some religions like \" Rastafari is the religion about smoking various kinds of plants and the letter ' I '.\" I enjoyed it because I would have probably not been allowed to read before now and sort of wished I could have read it back then. However, I would suggest it to people who do not get offended by things easily and no one under the age of 13 read it just because of some of the references.\n",

      "This book is a biography about Frida Kahlo. It talks about her art, childhood, political beliefs, family, and the car accident that effected her life. It talks in depth about her relationship with her husband Diego Rivera. It talks about her influence in her time and in the future and present in Mexico. It also talks about her time in the United States.\n",
      "A big event that effected Frida's life is the accident that left her in the hospital. The accident affected in her many ways one of the ways is that it made her discover her love for painting. While she was in the hospital she began to paint. At first painting her family then painting some of her infamous self portraits. Another thing that effected her is her husband Diego Rivera. Diego is a painter himself whom is much older than Frida. She met him while attending high school at first they didn't have such a romantic relationship. Then later on they got in a relationship that turned into a marriage. Their marriage was a very painful one that at times made Frida depressed since he would be with several other women. She even painted The Two Fridas a very famous painting of hers because of their eventual divorce. Another effect of Diego is he made her even more interested in the Mexican Communist party. She very heavily believed in Communist beliefs.\n",
      "I liked the book since I was very interested in Frida. I enjoyed the book because it showed the effects she had in Mexico. I thought it was pretty cool that it showed how powerful she was and influenced women and equality in Mexico. I liked that it showed more than her happy side since she is often perceived to have had a painful and depressed life. It also goes into detail about the events in her life.\n",

      "Oh how I love Frida Kahlo. Before this book, I didn't realize how much pain she had went through during her life. She inspires me so much, and has inspired so much beautiful art.\n",

      "I hated this book. And the more and more I read it, the more and more my hatred grew. It was so horrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jake shows up after 4 years of absence, looking to 'lay claim' to the woman he ALLEGEDLY loves. Michelle. He last saw her 3.5 years ago when she showed up at the Navy SEAL base to pour her heart out to him, and he said some horrible horrible things to her. Like that she's a gold-digging slut. And \"all I ever wanted was a piece of that grade-A ass.\" And \"You keep that sinfully luscious mouth of yours wide like that, babe, and you'll have Preacher down on one knee pledging his everlasting love within a week.\" How about \"Don't you go thinking you're any different from the scores of other girls I bagged at the [club]. The only thing that sets you apart from them is the fact that you never got me off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*Carmen excuses herself to be sick.*\n",
      "\n",
      "Our hero, ladies and gentlemen. Now. Would you ever allow a man back into your panties after he said such things to you? NO. You would never, ever engage in any sexual contact with him ever again. Y punto. End of discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this book's whole entire premise is already beyond the abilities of MY imagination. I don't care if he shows up, three years later, on his knees, begging me to give him another chance, claiming that he loves me. I DON'T GIVE A CARE. You didn't only lose your chance, asshole, you blew it into smithereens.\n",
      "\n",
      "She tries to call him. She writes him letters. She's still trying to have a life with him. He ignores it all. Why is she trying so hard after he's obviously shown her that he's a piece of shit?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So already this book is grating my cheese, right? I mean, I can't even with this shit. What an asshole.\n",
      "\n",
      "BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. There's other problems. Let's talk about them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to ignore the little problems, like the fact that our asshole hero thinks the fact that Michelle is putting on lipstick indicates that she wants to impress him and have sex with him, or the fact that the author refers to breasts as \"funbags.\" Yes, funbags. That's just exactly the terminology I want used in my romance novels. NOT.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, let's focus on the bigger problems. Like the fact that \"our hero\" keeps fantasizing about Michelle down on her knees sucking him off. This is REALLY disrespectful and skeezy. I want to read a romance (Romance!) in which instead of reading about love and sweet things and stuff like that, I get this. I mean, I don't care if the MCs engage in this in the bedroom, the problem I have is that what's running through his mind while looking at the heroine isn't something like \"She's so smart/pretty/fun,\" or \"I want to kiss her\" or \"I love her\" or \"She's such a great mom to her son\" or \"I've missed her so much\" or something it's like \"I really want to see her lips wrapped around my cock.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Listen... there is NOTHING romantic about that. It's skeeving me out and making me view him as a creeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another problem I had: there's one black person in this novel - the babysitter/nanny - and she is brutally murdered and I mean it is really icky. And I have a soft-spot for babysitters and nannies. It was just very disgusting. And they refer to her \"milk-chocolate skin,\" which makes me rabid.\n",

      "Let's see, what else?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, yeah. He is always using force to get what he wants from her and he doesn't take 'no' for an answer. I was cringing at how many times he is physical with her, grabbing her and shaking her or\n",

      "he's all like, \"Well, what are you going to do?\" And \"These things happen\" when she's obviously hugely upset and already a mother and he's a fucking asshole. She (for VERY understandable reasons!) does not want to have this guy's kid. I can't blame her!\n",

      "P.P.S I forgot to mention that he says \"yo\" all the time. \"Yo, mama!\" when he's really excited. Just think about reading the inner monologue of someone who uses the word \"yo\" as much as normal people say, \"uh\" or \"well.\" It would have been laughable if I didn't hate him so much.\n",

      "Rev it Up is the third book in Julie Ann Walker’s Black Knights, Inc. series and my favorite of the three, so far. The story was both action-packed and poignant, opening with a heartbreaking, intense scene that had me feeling anger, sadness and loss. From the very first pages the tortured hero, Jake Sommers, grabbed hold of my heart and didn’t let go.\n",
      "Soldier. Hero. Ladies’ Man. He’s the one who broke her heart...\n",
      "\n",
      "Career soldier Jake “The Snake” Sommers has made a few mistakes in his life, but none so terrible as forsaking the only woman he’s ever loved. But he’s finally conquered his inner demon, the one that thirsted only for blood. So, now he’s back. And he’s not leaving without Michelle. Unfortunately, her enemy has other plans. Plans to see her dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Michelle Carter has never forgiven Jake for abandoning her all those years ago. Now he’s suddenly back, after she’s finally begun to make a life for herself. But her safe, orderly world is about be blown apart. With a psychotic Las Vegas mobster gunning for her, she has no choice but to turn to Jake. Only there’s more at stake than her life. As they all head for a showdown, something that was never meant to be revealed is suddenly thrown into the light. And with a secret this hot, there’s bound to be an explosion.\n",
      "I’ve enjoyed all three BKI stories but this one drew me in on many levels. A truly emotionally tortured hero, a widow whose husband served with Jake, raising her small child alone, fighting the memories of her own dysfunctional childhood that we learned of in the last book… yes, this story has it all and kept me turning the pages faster and faster wanting to find out what happens next, yet not wanting the story to end.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the things I most love about Ms. Walker's writing is her ability to take us from poignant to sexy to funny to intense... and she does it so well that you can actually imagine yourself there, caught up in whatever it is that's taking place. And I love that! I want to be drawn in. I want to feel the passion, the fear, the hope... to be engrossed, enthralled and captivated by the story and the characters, and with that's exactly what I got. I can't ask for more than that!\n",

      "I tried, I swear I tried, but really I couldn't bear this idiocy. I don't know what other people's idea of romance is. I don't think mine is something like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I find awful that a woman's life is on hold because eons ago she loved a prick and could never overcome this love. (It's demeaning to her husband and whatever love she had for him, too.) I find awful that he expects to come back to her life and she has to roll with it. I find awful that a brother wouldn't stand on his sister's side and would choose his fellow soldier. At least do wonder why she's taking a stand.\n",
      "\n",
      "This series is a wishful thinking on the part of the author, writing contemporary and mistaking it with fantasy. I do believe if you write contemporary, it has to be , not some kind of fairy tale. Didn't we survive the Harlequin phase?\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I was cringing for all the third of the book I was reading. So I said myself? Why? Did I do something for which shall I be punished? (Well, there was that chunk of chocolate I ate today, but it can't be, can it?)\n",
      "\n",

      "I laughed quite a lot while i was reading the book, which is always a plus. I also liked that there are kickass females in the book, i get so fed up with girls who are totally pansies who depend on the men to make everything alright. There were a few surprises thrown in a long the way to keep the interest levels up.\n",

      "Tillie Cole slayed me. Damn This book was everything I wanted and more. Souls Unfractured is my favorite book in the Hades Hangmen series. I fell madly in love with Flame in the first book. He was so broken I just wanted to fix him and make it all better. So I couldn't wait to get to his and Maddie's book. And it was better then I expected. There was some seriously dark, twisted, and taboo parts in this book, but Flame and Maddie's relationship was touching, powerful, and beautiful. This book obliterated me, broke my heart then pieced me back together. Although I am pretty sure I need some therapy after reading this! But damn it was worth it!\n",

      "Maddie having escape only a few months ago from The Order, a religious cult that branded her a cursed devil's whore since birth because of her beauty, lives in fear. Only one thing makes Maddie feel safe, feel anything and that is Flame. Flame, the man that killed her tormentor, Brother Moses, a man that raped and hurt her daily since she was six. Everyday Maddie sits in the window watching her hero Flame pace back and forth keeping guard over her, cutting himself. She watches and wishes to help him be free of his demons as he freed her of hers. She sits in her window and draws the life she wishes she could have with Flame, a life free of fear, a life with touch and love. Since neither her or Flame can stand to be touched she knows she can never have her dream of having a love with Flame like Lilah and Ky or Mae and Styx have, so she must be content with watching him and her art. But when some unknown thing triggers a mental break in Flame, and no one can reach him, Maddie knows she must go to him and try before it's to late!\n",

      "Flame is one of the most broken, raw, beautiful, and memorable characters I have ever read. He is now one of my top 5 favorite heroes of all times with Bone, Vlad, Talen Kayrs, and Ian Mackenzie. I could never do justice telling how damn amazing I find him, but I am going to try. Flame grew up in a religious cult too, one that doesn't believe in doctors, one where they dance with snakes, drink snake poison, and if a snake bites you it means you have evil in you. Having always been different, Flame didn't fit in. He didn't know how to talk to people, didn't understand facial expressions, social cues, or emotions. People always cried, laughed or got angry with him. The book never says, but I am sure he is high functioning autistic. His father would get mad, beat him, calling him a evil retard, not knowing what he did wrong he just stop talking which only made is father angrier. Telling Flame that he has the flames of hell running through his veins and that he is evil. His father takes him to their pastor who tortures him and let snakes bite and hurt him. When that doesn't work, his father takes him home and locks him in the cellar, beating and bleeding him to get the flames out. His mother not being able to take her husband's abuse of her or her sons kills herself leaving Flame alone with his evil father and baby brother. This of course causes his father to hate and hurt him more. Flame blames himself for his mother's death. His father told him she killed herself, because she hated having a evil retard for a son, then he starts daily raping Flame while cutting his back with a blade . Flame is a broken man, A man so damaged he thinks his touch kills and hurts. He always feels flames under his skin, he is always cutting himself trying to get them out. Reliving daily the abuse of his father in his head til it drives him crazy. Flame wants Maddie, but he doesn't want to hurt her with his touch. Maddie is his and he will do everything in his power to protect her even if he can never really be with her.\n",

      "Maddie and Flame together are one of the most beautiful couples ever. The way they give so much to each other, fight for each other, protect each other. The way their love overcomes their brokenness. Learning what true and pure love was together. Learning to touch each other, trust each other.\n",
      "It was heart warming, and breathtakingly beautiful. Their love was worth all the dark, gut wrenching things I had to read about their past. They both have been through fire and came out together stronger then ever.\n",

      "I still feel there is no redemption for Cain. I don't really care if he claims ignorance in the raping of children or the punishment of Lilah. He was told about it more than once, hell he seen enough with his own eyes to know it was true. He just didn't want to rock the boat and ruin his chance at getting Mae for himself. Turning a blind eye doesn't make him less guilty. Not to mention he also knows that women have no choice in having sex with men in what is called the Lord's sharing. No choice is rape! So he was okay openly with the rape of the women in The Order. So in my eyes he is not only a disgusting, repulsive bastard , but he is a coward and pussy too. Is it wrong that when his brother Judah betrayed him that I was laughing at him, enjoying the little bit of comeuppance Cain got while wishing it would have been worse? Will I read his book? You bet I will. Why because I have OCD and I won't be able to skip around, and I want to read the series I fell in love with all the way through. Plus I now hate his brother Judah too and want to see them both suffer.\n",

      "Tillie Cole is one of those authors I can always count on to make me feel when I read. She does an amazing job of writing tortured characters with emotional and beautiful stories. may be her most emotional book yet. Although I knew it would be. After hearing about the things Maddie (Mae’s sister) went through in the previous books, I knew her story would get to me. Pair that with Flame, who’s past may have been even more horrid and you’ll have a book that will keep your heart hurting, but in true Tillie fashion, it will be healed by the end of the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flame is one of those characters who I had to know about after reading the first two Hades Hangman books. He’s different than the rest of the Hangmen. He’s a little more violent, a little more quiet and there is something different about him… he can’t be touched by anyone. Not women, not his brothers that he trusts. He can’t cope with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He and Maddie have that in common. Maddie grew up in the same religious cult as Mae and Lilah. The man who had her was extra violent and terrible and has scarred Maddie. Men make her nervous, even good men. All men. All men, except for Flame. He saved her and she isn’t afraid of him.\n",
      "She dreams about being with Flame, about touching him. Even the most simple thing, like holding hands would mean the world to her. And this is not one sided. Flame wants more than anything to be able to touch Maddie. To be there for her when he needs her, to be able to hold her, but he’s not sure it’s possible. He cares too much for her to ever hurt her the way he feels he will if she gets too close.\n",

I could tell pretty much straight away why he was the way he was and knowing how he was treated growing up made me sick to my stomach. It’s not an easy read. But by the end, it’s so worth it. Maddie and Flame���s love story is worth all the heartache.\n",

Full of a beautiful intensity, her words move you, make you feel, break you apart, then heal that broken heart.

      "Overall I finished this story enjoying the ride, but it took waaaaaaay too long to really get going for me. I was still contemplating whether this would be a DNF at about the 50% mark. At that point, things finally picked up for me and the second half of this story was much more the adventure I was hoping the book would be. I usually find books in a series have too much recapping in the first few chapters, but this time I almost wished there was a bit more (odd, since I just finished the first in the series a couple of weeks before I started this installment)\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm uncertain whether I'd continue with the next in the series at this point, but (some of) the characters growing on me and there was at least one string left dangling that has me curious enough that I might pick up the next one if I see it on sale.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "After the pure, distilled joy NPCs brought me, I was eager to dive into the next book in the series. While Split the Party (which is such a bad idea there is even a book about aptly titled Don't Split the Party) was a great, action packed read, it lacked some of the charm the first book's premise brought to the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this installment our once minions turned reluctant adventurers have more or less fully embraced the mantle of adventurers and all the baggage that entails:\n",
      "So our brave heroes are on the run from a power-mad king who wants to hunt them down for a magic item they had recovered in the previous book. Of course, being adventurers now in a world whose rules are bent to provide adventurers quests and challenges, they naturally stumble into those two things. Circumstances force them to, you guessed it, split the party to achieve their goals (which mostly involve staying alive).\n",
      "\n",
      "As with NPCs, Hayes does an excellent job introducing both the reader, who may be unfamiliar with the cliches and tropes of RPGs, and the heroes to the life adventuring in a very seamless way. For most of their lives the heroes have lived in a town where a few gold coins was considered a lot of money. In adventuring a few gold is considered pocket change. When confronted by this harsh reality by the traveling merchant it becomes clear just how they are expected to build their wealth to be effective adventurers:\n",
      "When the rules of a table top RPG are the physical laws of a universe very strange things happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with all the hacking and slashing Hayes still finds space to further develop and grow his characters. We see Gabrielle worry over her value to the team, especially after her pilfered ax breaks and she feels like the others are far surpassing her abilities. We see Grumph's iron determination to protect his friends by risking life and limb to becomes a member of the Mage's Guild:\n",
      "We see Thistle continue to grow into his role as a Paladin and further his relationship with Grundle, the God of Minions whom he serves. Even poor, formerly mind controlled Timuscor begins to figure out what he really wants and how to achieve it. All said, as fun as the winks to RPGs were, the heart and soul of this series are the great characters and their relationships with each other. Even a person in complete ignorance of RPGs can appreciate the craft and care put into the characters and enjoy this for the adventure book that it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "But is isn't all hacking and slashing and serious character development. Hayes expertly sprinkles in humor and real world wisdom as well:\n",

      "Finally, on top of the great action, excellent character development, and well balanced humor, Hayes also advanced the greater plot of the series (how our world interacts with this fantastical one) and laid seeds for future developments (Gabrielle's new ax, MR. PEPPERS THE GREATEST PIG TO EVER BE SUMMONED, the machinations of gods, etc.). I wait in eager anticipation of the third installment, it cannot get here soon enough!\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Executive Summary: After a bit of a slow start, this one is as good as the first one, if not slightly better. I sure hope there will be a third book soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audiobook: So here's the downside of a relatively unknown author, with an excellent narrator. The ebook of this looks have come out several months before the audio version. Roger Wayne does such a great job narrating this, that I want to keep listening if/when there is a third book. But can I hold out waiting an extra 6 months to do it?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're an audio book person, you should do this series in audio. Maybe that will help his audiobook publisher hurry the hell up! Audio books are big business these days. I get frustrated (and a bit dumbfounded) when the audio book doesn't come out the same day as the text. It seems especially common among lesser known authors though.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to make it a bit of crusade to increase Mr. Hayes popularity (with whatever little influence my reviews may have at least), for the selfish reason that I want book 3 in audio sooner rather than later. That and I think many of you will enjoy this one in audio like I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed so much, I rushed right out and got this one. I found the start a bit slow. That was short lived though. In fact there was only one other scene where I wasn't completely sucked into this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only do we get the excellent characters, and RPG in-jokes from the first, but there is a really cool overarching plot developing. So when do we get the third book? Is it now? I'd like it now. Please say it's in the works at least!\n",
      "\n",
      "In this entry our favorite NPCs are back, and now joined by some excellent new characters. Meanwhile in the real world Tim and Russel are also back, but this time with other players more like those I played with in my 20s than the ones I sometimes suffered through in college.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm particularly interested to see where the main story will go, but in the meantime I enjoyed the main quest and side quests of this book quite a bit. I'm sure it's not a new idea, but I had never encountered a mage's guild with magic doors in various cities, but I totally love that idea, and wish my now bored/retired Wizard had been able to join.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite addition is probably the traveling saleswoman though. Sadly between the audio and my general terrible memory (especially for names), I couldn't tell you her name. She makes a great addition to the already excellent cast of characters of this series.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two books in, this series is a ton of fun. I have no idea how many more books Mr. Hayes has planned, but I'm eagerly hoping to get another one soon. In the meantime I'll continue to use whatever limited influence I have on goodreads to get more people to check out this series. If you're an RPG fan, I especially recommend this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grab your dice and roll along with the NPCs and the players as they take on many well-worn tropes in fun and often humorous fashion.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I'm in the process of reading another book by Mr. Hayes right and I've got to say I have yet to pick one up I haven't enjoyed, greatly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we're following the adventures of a group of NPCs (Non-Player Characters) who have found themselves taking the part of (and ultimately becoming) \"Adventurers\".\n",
      "\n",
      "This series is completely engaging for me and I find myself waiting and hoping for the next installment in the series. That is a bit odd for me as I also like his Super Powereds series and want to see it continue to. I've not tried his Accountant Vampire series...I've never been much on \"cute\" vampires. That said Hayes is such a good writer I may try it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look if you're a gamer I think you'll love this book and this series. Even if you're not I believe the humor and adventure will draw you in. So while I know \"liking\" any novel is a matter of taste I can highly recommend this great piece of brain candy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy.\n",

      "I love this series, 4 1/2 stars, this 2nd book is better then the first the characters get more interesting and the new character's introduced are equally interesting and somewhat mysterious looking at you Fritz. I'm off to read volume three right now.\n",

      "I started watching wrestling around Wrestlemania II or III but I was never a huge fan since I wasn't into Hogan or the stars of the time, I was more into the NWA (Magnum T.A, Rock n Roll Express, Road Warriors, Lex Lugar). But I've kind of kept an ear open about wrestling and heard names over the years so even if I wasn't a big fan I was at least aware that a particular guy was a big deal.\n",

      "This is a brilliant comprehensive resource for young people. It is a book that children can interact with, not a dry book on the subject that they have to read. It is illustrated well throughout so is less intimidating. It is an introduction to CBT, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Mindfulness and how these methods can be used to help with self esteem. Self – Esteem and lack thereof is also explained so that children understand why they are experiencing these feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book is meant to be written in, there are lots of spaces for the user to fill in their own experiences and thoughts throughout. The feelings they are experiencing are explained along with any negative behaviours that may result from these. Coping strategies are discussed and the reader is encouraged to try different methods to help their situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall definitely be purchasing this book for my son who will soon be 11, in these strange times, I feel any resource that can help his mental health is beneficial.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "This is an excellent book for children, pre-teens, and teenagers. It introduces very complex ideas in an engaging, easy to understand way. It's simple, but not condescending, which is difficult to pull off. As an adult, I've had therapists who did a worse job of explaining Mindfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The presentation is very good for the age-range that it is intended for; there's a good balance of texts and images. It's a workbook so it begs to be written in, which is a good outlet for creativity. I like that it gives examples of how other children have completed the tasks - in poems, drawings, etc. - because it shows kids that there's no right way to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This workbook is empowering for young people because it doesn't just say, ''If you have a problem, go tell an adult.'' It tells them that they should acknowledge their feelings. It also tells them that THEY can change the way they feel - which is important because part of being that age is feeling like you don't control anything. This book says, ''Let yourself feel your feelings and, if you don't like the way it feels, take steps to change it.'' More young people need to hear that. It also asks them to take responsibility for their own negative behaviour, which is also important.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would also recommend this book for people who work with youngsters, as well as parents, because it's a gentle reminder of how what you say and do can affect their development. (There's a bit just for adults at the end.) It'd be a great thing for parents and children to work through together.\n",

      "Reading these poems is like being a stunned Canadian tourist visiting famous European sites for the first time.

      "Larkin was undeniably brilliant at his best and even at his less than stellar he's still usually at least somewhat amusing or has a great line here or there. For the lay reader, the Complete Poems is probably a bit much, at least it was for me. A third of these poems come from the collections. Another ten percent or so were published in his lifetime, but even among those much of the work is juvenelia, published in high school or college literary magazines. Wholly too much of what's here is youthful Larkin finding his feet, then towards the end you get a bunch of scraps and extras. There are often gems hiding in a couplet pulled from a letter or even a youthful stab at something, but I would have strongly preferred a Selected edition, where the wheat was separated from the chaff for me. I did appreciate the copious and fastidious notes compiled by editor Archie Burnett, which do put the poems in context and deepen the reading experience. Another aspect of reading a metric ton of Larkin is the fact that the man himself was more than a bit of an asshole. That's easier to ignore reading the published work, but as you get into the ephemera, especially late in life, his political and racial attitudes start shining through and are unpleasant and impossible to ignore. That said, when he's good he's quite good. He was also, of course, quite funny. Why are American conservatives almost never funny? It's like you have to give up your sense of humor when you register as a Republican. Tories don't seem to have this problem, or at least they didn't used to back in Larkin's day.\n",

      "Philip Larkin, the saddest heart in the post-war supermarket... from what we know him best by. But what is striking is the large amount of unpublished material from his early years which strikes another tone, as well as the light verse taken from his letters. The image of the dour faced and sparely written bureaucrat/poet for whom there was no longer a \"myth-kitty\" to draw from juxtaposes itself with the prolific student bubbling over with influences and symbols, as well as the sarcastic penner of bawdy limericks to his friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither of the other two modes is as genius as the one we know him for. The first was full of juvenile aspirations and ham-fisted themes and influences. The latter, had neither the nuance or dimensionality of superb light verse. Still, for better or for worse, every single lyrical verse penned by Larkin is here, with back-end commentary and variations from drafting. Likely, given his own highly reserved manner and cultivated distance from his audience, Larkin himself would not be happy with this edition. His own letters and notes written on pages clearly denote that he thought the bulk of his early work before he found his particular voice and niche in his 30s was bad, and to be honest, his estimation is correct. It's often derivative and occluded. Other times, the frustrations of the writing process break out in the poetry itself. One unfinished and unpublished work just breaks into a long CRAPCRAPCRAPCRAP and stops mid-line. The mature Larkin was definitely one who spent much time crafting and polishing what he wrote. In some respects, he had to, as the prolific nature of his writing output in his youth dwindled with age, to the point that he did not write much at all in the final decade of his life (though my personal favorite \"Aubade\" was written during this time).\n",
      "\n",
      "In some ways, if you already have a collection of Larkin's verse, you really don't need to get this one. You're mostly getting things he didn't publish for a very good reason. If you're looking to see his development as a poet, his judgement of his own works, as well as his writing process and influences, then this book should be on the list. Just be prepared to wade through a lot of juvenalia and poetic blocs to get there. Certainly, the amount of work and struggle it took to get where he got is something heartening to another poet who feels like all they're producing is crap as well.\n",

Really marvelous -- and it definitely adds to my appreciation, all the relevant quotes from letters and references to possible sources both in books an real life provided in the notes.\n",

Part of the problem is that the story is so subtle sometimes, that it is very easy for a party to completely miss the clues of the overplot and become uninvested in the final outcome.

      "==============\n",
      "Twelve of the 13 stories in this collection take up the lives of historical women who are either virtually unknown or only known through association with more famous figures. As Bergman puts it in her author’s note, the stories “are born of fascination with real women whose remarkable lives were reduced to footnotes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of our ‘almost famous’ heroines are Lord Byron’s illegitimate daughter, Allegra; Oscar Wilde’s niece, Dolly; Edna St. Vincent Millay’s acting sister, Norma; and James Joyce’s unstable dancer daughter, Lucia. There are also historical figures you may have heard of but likely know little about: painter Romaine Brooks, actress Butterfly McQueen (one of the maids in ), and early aviatrix Beryl Markham. There is such variety in this baker’s dozen of stories: they are split almost equally between the past and present tense, and between first- and third-person perspectives, although the latter wins out a bit more often.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two stories even use the , a viewpoint of which I’m particularly fond. “The Internees” is a story in miniature, just one and a half pages, depicting the female residents of Bergen-Belsen in 1945. When liberation comes and they are able to wear lipstick again, it restores their identity: “We were human again. We were women.” This perspective also has an intriguing use in the first story, “The Pretty, Grown-Together Children,” about conjoined twins Daisy and Violet Hilton. Although Daisy is the chief narrator, she sometimes lapses into first-person plural: “We were somewhere between singular and plural.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Hilton twins were beyond the pale because of their physical uniqueness, other heroines are so because of their sexuality. For instance, “The Siege at Whale Cay” is about Marlene Dietrich’s visit to lesbian couple Georgie and Joe – M. B. “Joe” Carstairs, a larger-than-life heiress who owned a Caribbean island and held sway over the locals. Dolly Wilde was also a lesbian; in two subtle connections with previous stories, she once shared a lover of Romaine Brooks’s, and corresponded with Joe Carstairs (both were ambulance drivers during World War I).\n",
      "\n",
      "The main characters of the final story, “Hell-Diving Women,” are doubly unconventional: black and lesbian, they were members of the first integrated female swing band. Whether they break racial or sexual taboos or (like Romaine) are so old the world no longer remembers them, all of these women are outsiders. Yet they are such vibrant individuals they simply cannot blend into the crowd; “You don’t have the luxury of being mediocre,” the Millay girls’ mother chides them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the stories are set in the 1910s-40s, but a couple of notable ones break that mold. “The Autobiography of Allegra Byron,” narrated by the little girl’s nurse at the Italian convent where she lived the last two years of her short life, is set in the 1820s. “The Lottery, Redux” is set in an unspecified near future and has dystopian elements. It’s the odd one out in that it does not contain any historical figures. Rather, it is inspired by Shirley Jackson’s most famous short story. A second generation of exiles on the island of Timothy, banished for “environmental crimes,” must reduce their population one by one through a ritualized ceremony.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite story of all is “Saving Butterfly McQueen.” The narrator, Elizabeth, is about to cut into a cadaver as part of her medical training in Baltimore. Suddenly her mind jumps back to the moment when, as a teen on a door-to-door evangelism mission in Georgia, she met Butterfly McQueen on her doorstep. McQueen was an avowed atheist and told Elizabeth not to waste her time; she was going to be donating her body to science. Especially when Elizabeth’s mother became ill with cancer, she came to realize how, for McQueen, dedicating her body to research “was about taking control of the thing that was undeniably hers.” Although the framework is fictional, McQueen’s story is historical. It reminded me of by Rebecca Skloot, one of my favorite recent books.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, many of these stories could lead readers directly into longer works. Here are a few of my related recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "If you like “The Siege at Whale Cay,” try by Naomi Wood and by Sarah Waters.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you like “Hazel Eaton and the Wall of Death,” try by Rachel Kushner.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you like “The Autobiography of Allegra Byron,” try by Lois Leveen.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you like “A High-Grade Bitch Sits Down for Lunch,” try by Paula McLain.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you like “The Lottery, Redux,” try by Susan Scarf Merrell.\n",

      "This is a rich, wonderful collection. If I have one point of criticism, it is that the shorter stories (several in the range of 3–5 pages) don’t add much to the whole. The in-depth character analysis you get in the longer stories is where Bergman shines. I can see this book fulfilling a dual gateway function: inviting those who normally read non-fiction, especially biographies, to attempt some fiction; and luring historical fiction lovers to give both short stories and non-fiction a chance. Bergman’s author’s note gives her sources and initial inspirations for each of the stories, so readers can follow up on anything of particular interest.\n",

      "As the narrator of “Who Killed Dolly Wilde?” muses, “Maybe the world had been bad to its great and unusual women. Maybe there wasn’t a worthy place for the female hero to live out her golden years, to be celebrated as the men had.” That is, until Bergman’s terrific book gave these almost famous women the perfect showcase.\n",

      "I will admit to spending quite a bit of time looking up many of the people these stories were written about. All exceedingly well written though, but there were two that really resonated with me. The two about the oldest and the youngest. Romaine remains, after a fully decadent life Romaine is now 93 and housebound. The people who are hired to care for her take advantage of her in many ways. Something about being that elderly and becoming a victim after living a life on virtually her own terms just filled me with pity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story was the story of Allegra Byron, which starts when she is three. So incredibly sad, this young lady and her short tragic life. Loved the author for imagining someone who really loved her and tried to care for her, show her a little joy. Found myself hoping such a person actually existed.\n",

      "These are thirteen stories about extraordinary women whose “lives were reduced to footnotes.” My two favorites featured Allegra Byron (Lord Byron’s illegitimate daughter) and Butterfly McQueen (an actress who played one of the maids in Gone with the Wind). All of the stories offer an unusual combination of grit and sensitivity. Most feature these women when they’re well past their primes, giving the whole collection a melancholy feel that kept me from wanting to read too many stories at once (there’s a lot of sagging flesh, drug addictions, and wasted dreams). But I highly recommend checking this collection out – Bergman is incredibly talented.\n",

      "I absolutely LOVED this one! I'm usually not a fan of short story collections. For me, they just don't work well together. This book, however, is the exception. I devoured this book, and would've finished it in one setting if I had the time! Each story represents a fictionalized account of an almost famous woman. I was fascinated, intrigued, and interested in reading about these amazing women. Some more impactful than others, but savored each one for what it was. It would be extremely difficult for me to even choose a favorite. I could sit back and go back through them all over again.\n",

After many adventures, mirroring Ulysses’ problematic navigation in the tricky waters of the Mediterranean, they land in the country where “fate” tells them to found a new empire based on Aeneas’ descendants.

      "Roman culture is in many ways a direct copy and paste of earlier Greek achievements, and their Olympus is mostly identical, just renamed. But there are peculiarities within the Aeneid that give it a specific flavour and make it enjoyable to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, Aeneas’ visit to the Underworld is hilarious, and he meets both past and future celebrities of his tribe. The modern reader may wonder how life in the Underworld works out practically, with Creusa, Dido, and eventually also Lavinia all joined together in their love for Aeneas? Is polygamy acceptable in the Underworld, if it is only practised as serial monogamy on earth? But those are amusing, theological reflections that the heroes do not dwell on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much more interesting are the godly powers that support or oppose Aeneas’ cause, with Venus, his mother, being his most ardent advocate in Olympus, and with Juno being his most hateful enemy. A combination that puts Jupiter in a pickle, of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aeneas manages to have weapons of mass destruction delivered by the joint effort of Venus and Vulcan, and it is of peculiar interest to archaeologists that his shield carries the future of Rome written down for him: a prophetic text! Or a wonderfully amusing way to establish legitimacy through translatio historiae? Rewriting history when needed for political purposes is not an invention of Orwell’s . Dante later added his own journey to the Underworld under the guidance of experienced traveller Virgil - translatio studii - as illustrated in , and beautifully painted by Delacroix, in another simultaneous leap forwards and backwards in history, creating connections between times and characters:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What made me read the ancient text, and stick it out until the end, despite being frustrated at times when the war turned into repetitive, graphically described slaughter, involving heads cut open so that brains are split in half, and any other imaginable mutilation of human bodies, over page after page?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is the interesting question of heroic ideal, alive and terrifyingly deadly still in World War I and II, of “Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori”, the famous line from Virgil’s contemporary Horace’s Odes. One young man in the Aeneid puts it quite bluntly: if I win, I will bring home lots of booty, and if I fall, I will be an immortal hero. Either way, my father will be proud.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are the relationships between men and women, and the role of women in general. Camilla, the warrior virgin modelled on Amazons Hippolyta or Penthesilea, the mighty Carthaginian queen Dido, who has a strong mind of her own, and Lavinia, the booty for the winner in the war, are all different representatives of ancient women’s roles and status in society. For the modern reader, the goddesses in the Olympian council are more amusing types, playing the political advocates of the causes they support, fearlessly, adamantly, and in eternal frustration over the slow pace of the action, and over the cacophony of a polytheistic assembly, all with equal right to speak and lobby - and to which they add incessantly. Quite like international committees nowadays, weighing different claims, needs and justice against each other!\n",
      "\n",
      "General verdict: if you love mythology, historical processes as mirrored in fiction, graphic war scenes, unhappy love, and stormy seas, as well as the neverending story of human fight for power and legitimacy, then the Aeneid is highly recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed it all, and will close with a bow to Dido, my favourite ancient, tragic heroine so far! She did not really get a chance, representing Carthage. Her suicide was a necessary construction to symbolise the wars to come:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam, said Cato, and Dido was just one of many to suffer from Roman power play. A mighty queen, nonetheless!\n",

      "I’m a huge fan of propaganda, but I think I may not be a fan of fan fic. I was going into this with the hope that it would be fun, extreme, Latin propaganda, but The Aeneid is really more Trojan War fan fic, IMO. It’s the Phantom Menace to The Iliad’s Empire Strikes Back. It is seriously lame. I think Akira Kurosawa could have made a pretty decent movie of it because he likes to have people frenzy. There’s a lot of frenzying here. The dudes are all chest pound, blooooood, and the chicks are all hair pull, frenzy, waaaaaail. And Aeneas is such a dweeb about the name-dropping. Like, “Oh, did I mention that Venus is my mom? Oh, did I tell you how freaking hot I am? Yeah, I was totally there when Odysseus scammed the Cyclops.” Give me a freaking break. Did you scam the Cyclops? No. Get over yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what happens when you start a series, and then someone else wants to capitalize on your story. It’s the fifth season of or the seventh season of or all the Jane Austen / Jane Eyre sequels and prequels. It just doesn’t work. Find your own story! I’m looking at you, Virgil. Not that I’m against people using storylines that someone else has used. That’s almost inevitable (and, of course, Shakespeare is a good argument for being okay with stealing). But, there is a line. I’m not positive where it is. This story crossed it. And then don’t even get me started about Dante. WHY?! Virgil’s got his guys running into Homer’s guys, and then Dante’s running into Virgil? It’s just so presumptuous. I guess, it’s like, go ahead and steal a really wonderful storyline if you have something to add to it. But don’t think that your SUPER LAME storyline is going to suddenly turn wonderful because you drop a character from a good story into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there are some seriously weird details to this story. For example, Venus is this guy’s mom, but she doesn’t raise him to know not to pull a George Costanza in running away from the Greeks? Dude. It just takes a second to wait for your wife, you loser. I mean, I’m no great fan of Venus to begin with, but that’s just weird. It seems like she would have taken a minute to say, \"Don't trample people running away from your enemies.\" Maybe it never occurred to her he'd be so lame.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then the business with Dido was just annoying. She’s the queen of all the land, has been through hell, wherein her eeeevil brother killed her seemingly pretty awesome husband, and then when Aeneas says to Dido, “btw, it was great sleeping with you, but I have a lot of heads to chop off for no particular reason, so I should prolly get going,” she goes all Kathy Bates in all of a sudden. Except lamer because she’s wailing and self-mutilating instead of taking it out on him. It’s just awkward to watch. Girl needs a . And none of these people are as cool as they think they are.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the rest of the book is basically one long chest pound. I guess there’s the part where he goes to Hades, and lo, he knows folk there. I’m kind of bitter about the whole thing because Juno’s so funny and great in and such a loser here. Again, Akira Kurosawa probably could have turned it into a pretty decent movie. I don’t really get the frenzying thing, but Kurosawa seemed to have liked it. And, if you like people to run around, chopping limbs off and then whining and blustering for a while, you might really click with this book. What I’m saying, though, is if you haven’t read , that’s where it’s at. I recommend, for best results, reading it in a hammock.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Impossible to rank a book that is so important, that has so many problems, that holds moments of deep and beautiful simile and metaphor, that treats its lead with shocking inconsistency, whose ending is an eruption of modern plot that redeems the whole book.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ferry translation is quick and good and worth noting.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is staggering overlap with The Iliad and the Odyssey throughout- Cyclops and Scylla and Charybdis were surprises here, as is the rip off of the in media res structure. We have storms (Poseidon as savior, instead of tormentor was an interesting twist), a separation of forces, a host. But everything seems condensed .\n",
      "\n",
      "Dido, as you might hope, pops off the page. That amazing section on page 17 that scans over her dead husband was so unbelievably Hamlet, and there was something tragic about Cupid's bewitching her:\n",
      "\"And Cupid, to please his Acidalian mother,\n",
      "Begins, little by little, to erase\n",
      "From Dido's mind the image of Sychaeus,\n",
      "And to substitute a living passion in\n",
      "A heart and soul long unaccustomed to love.\" (33)\n",
      "\n",
      "But as with the windmills in Don Quixote, she is too quickly gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Roman propaganda is interesting throughout but in some ways, it is less pronounced than I would have thought, save for one outrageous description of a piece of armor. It put me in mind of just Grossman's Stalingrad (it's great). To get it by the Soviet censors he had to (among many other things) add a 40 page section about how heroic coal miners are - and I ended up fascinated by that section, in its lack of nuance and its propulsion, in how a talented writer operates in restrictive systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second half, in Italy, is a more human-oriented text, and somewhat ridiculous. The book's supporting characters, especially the lovers Nisus and Euryalus, are stronger than the lead. The book is rarely a page turner, but it is incredibly worth your time. It is very, very different than you might expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two things: The treatment of the underworld is gorgeous, in Book 6. It is, of course, Dantean pre Dante. Critic Madeline Miller points out that \"when Aeneid is in hell, after he finishes admiring that same glorious pageant of future Roman heroes, he finds himself before two gates. One is made of horn and is, Virgil tells us, for “true shades.” The other, made of ivory, is for “false dreams.” And Aeneas, founder of the gleaming vision of Roman history we have just seen, leaves through the latter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Borges was preoccupied by this distinction too, and I wonder if there are some hints here of the undermining that I feel is at work in The Aeneid some impulse to attack the very root of the project, of fiction, of the need for Roman propaganda in a poem, even of the need for empire and cultural assimilation.\n",

Tate disrespected Bones ever chance he got. Rubbing his feelings for Cat in Bones's face.

      "I really liked the concept behind this book, but I think it has one fatal flaw. I don't think their system for tallying up the quiz answers was really accurate. I got Dauntless, which didn't feel right to me at all, but that was how the math worked out on their system. They put a specific answer that is supposed to be the \"Divergent\" answer with each question, and that seemed odd to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was fun to play with this, and I hope my students (for whom I really bought this) enjoy it, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for an accurate answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: After writing this, I had a student take it, and her answers all seemed to follow the same pattern, and thus her result made sense. I decided then to go back and more closely analyze my results. Basically, all the 2s represent Abnegation, 4s represent Amity, 6s Candor, 8s Dauntless, 10s Erudite, and 12s Divergent. I tallied the number of answers I got for each category. I had 12 Amity answers, 12 Erudite answers, and 10 Candor answers. Basically I'm Divergent. This method made MUCH more sense to me!\n",

      "This was okay. It was interesting to read all the little scenarios and consider how you actually would react when put in that situation... but the results were a bit meh and they didn't really seem to match up with the answers, which is probably unavoidable when you use a \"calculate your total count\" type of method (in which case you could have half Abnegation and half Divergent and no other answers and it would still put you in Candor instead of either one). Apparently my faction would be Candor, which I don't mind, though I tried going through the number to faction list that someone else posted in the reviews here and according to that, I had the most Amity replies (12), followed by Divergent (11). Abnegation & Candor (9), Erudite (7) and Dauntless (2), which seems to make a lot more sense. So, yes... Cool concept, but flawed execution.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Umm, Dauntless? I am the very definition of a pacifist. The way of determining your faction I thought was very skewed. Like I get it it’s basically your average but STILL that’s not a very good way to determine something so big. Also, a couple of the “quizzes” were really weird and not important. So ok, but not good at determining results. I think a buzzfeed quiz would have been better and more user friendly with less room for error than a book but still it’s a cool idea.\n",

      "There are some people in the world to whom music is as vital as oxygen. To those--me, and certainly Emma Trevayne, the author of Coda--music has the ability to heighten emotions, to heal, to soothe, to enrige, and excite. To us, music is as potent as any drug, and almost as addicting.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Anthem, and the rest of the citizens in The Web, there is no almost. Music is quite literally a drug, one as addicting as any narcotic. And just as dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Anthem's post-war world on the island of Manhatten, the Corp--the nameless, faceless, despotic government--controls everyone through music specially encoded to be as addicting, and mood-altering as possible. It keeps the citizens passive, keeps them dependent--and ensures they don't live long enough to have time to do anything but survive.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Anthem has a secret. He and four others meet secretly once a week to play music together--real music, without any encoding. Music created just for the joy of it, an outlet for their rage, and their sorrow, and the sweet thrill of the illicit, and the free.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even with the pure high playing gives him, he can't escape the addiction the Corp has bred in him. He craves the high as much as he despises it. When he's tracking is the only time he feels free, yet it is when he's most chained.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It isn't until a friend is killed right in front of him that Anthem begins to wonder if their music is worth something more than the few moments of freedom it allows him and the band. Could their songs incite a rebellion? Could they be an anthem for the revolution the people so desperately need?\n",
      "\n",
      "Coda has a cool-factor unlike anything I've read. A cyberpunk--part dystopian, part science fiction--thriller set in futuristic Manhatten, with the requisite gadgetry, romance, and the added benefit of a rockstar? Sign me up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a fast read, intense and sometimes violent, but not without nuance or sublety. In a world built on absolutes, Anthem is a character drawn in shades of gray. He is conflicted and flawed, never entirely sure of himself, only that he can't go on as he has. And though the action and intensity may be the melody to Coda, the elements that stick in your head the most when you remember the story, Anthem's heart is the backbeat to it all. Steady, unwaverying, and giving structure to it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coda is a unique read, fast and intense, and fun, with twists you won't see coming (but will probably want to yell at Ms. Trevayne about. Go ahead. I already have.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Full disclosure: I am one of Emma Trevayne's crit partners, and first read Coda when Emma pinged me and said, \"hey, I read a chapter of this thing. Wanna read it?\" And though it's gone through some changes from gdoc to book, at the heart it's the same story that thrilled me from the first page almost two years ago.\n",

She did an excellent job of pouring out her heart and soul into her life story (5 stars), but she went a little overboard on her ideas as to overcome some of her hardships -which were many- and relate that to our everyday life situations (4 stars). I have seen Jewel 13 times in concert and met her twice personally and thought I knew her story, but she really went in depth to give us the real story behind her courageous and incredible career.\n",

      "This is quite simply one of the greatest books I have ever read (or listened to, in this case, as I usually do these days with non-fiction if it's read by the author). I was looking forward to it as I do anything Jewel puts out but I feel almost ashamed now to admit that I wasn't expecting anything earth shattering. But the opening simply blew my head open and the feeling never let up for the whole 10hrs+. What a life - what a mind. Jewel turns autobiography into poetry, covering the history of her family, her rise in the music industry and the events that have seen her disappear somewhat from the limelight in fascinating detail. I had no idea about so much of this and haven't been the heaviest of fans when it comes to her music - it's always just been nice to see that she has something new out and there's usually at least a song or two per album that really hits home for me - but reading this (and then revisiting her catalogue afterwards, as I've just begun - I can't believe how long it's been since I listened to Pieces of You…) I felt like the guy in that story about Jesus on the beach and the footprints in the sand… it's like Jewel's been there for me all my adult life, feeding me all this wisdom, teaching me how to feel, often speaking my mind before I knew it myself, and quite often I didn't even know it, and the book just clarified so much about those years and made me feel like I have always been on the right path. I just know that this book is going to help so many people.\n",

      "I've always been a fan of Jewel and knew a little about her life, but I was excited to learn more. Jewel has been through so much in her life and is an artist I admire for not only her talent, but her drive and resilience. She narrated the audiobook herself and there were snippets of some songs, which was fun. And of course, as soon as I finished the book I had to go and listen to some of my favorite Jewel songs :)\n",

      "This is one of the most interesting autobiographies I’ve gotten to listen to in a long time. When Jewel goes and talks about song lyrics in her story she then sings the song a cappella. It’s really an amazing touch in the audiobook. I’ve enjoyed Jewel’s music if it came on the radio but I never really sought it out before. I’d heard the story of how she had gotten her recording contract before and I was interested in finding out the rest of her story. She was raised in remote Alaska and there by chance got a partial scholarship to Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan to study music. She almost got expelled the first day as she walked onto campus with skinning knife on her belt. Something she always had on her in Alaska. She went to busking and playing in coffee shops to make money and that’s where she gets discovered by the record companies. It’s quite a story. I think I’m going to go back and listen to all of her music now.\n",

      "Jewel has written a deep and revealing book. Part memoir and part self-help manual, Never Broken chronicles her life, and never ending journey of self-discovery. Along the way she relates lessons from her childhood in Alaska, and cautionary tales from her 20 years in the music business. She shares how she overcame an abusive childhood, homelessness, and a bankruptcy brought on by her wacko mothers excessive spending. She also discusses marriage, motherhood, and divorce, and shares the self reflection techniques that have gotten her through each, and have helped her emerge bruised, but never broken.\n",

      "Hard-core fans will really enjoy the audible experience with this title because she uses several of her songs and poems to illustrate lessons she's learned. The occasions where the author chose to go off on a self-reflective tangent were sometimes too long for me, but I think a lot of people will find this book inspiring, and hopefully helpful.\n",

Though, I did figure out the twist from being there...but it didn't spoil the book for me. I enjoyed reading it. I remember fussing at Savannah the whole entire book! What you should take away from this book is...\"don't be so quick to react...everything is not what it seems...maybe...\". But what would you do if you found a thong in your husband's suitcase after a business trip? You're feeling less than attractive because life has happened...then you see that. Imagine then questioning him about it...only to have him pass out from a heart attack! While he fights for his life, will you be able to concentrate? Probably not. For Savannah, everyone becomes a suspect.\n",

What I love about this play is the way in which it develops a conventionally suspenseful plot--complete with goodies and baddies, action-packed scuffles and wrestling matches, lovers \"meeting cute,\" etc.--at breakneck speed for all of the first act, and then slows to something close to a halt once it reaches the Forest of Arden.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is as it should be, since this forest is a place of magical transformation just as certainly as Oberon and Titania's fairie wood, a place where time stops and love grows and both are discussed and exemplified in language both witty and profound. At the end, all plot strands are resolved in what should be an unsatisfactory fashion, but somehow still manages to satisfy not only the characters themselves but also the audience, who have both been transformed by the timeless experience of Arden.\n",

      "Orlando, the youngest, and most loved son of the late Sir Rowland de Boys, ( set in France in the 16th Century) is being mistreated by his older brother Oliver, the middle son Jaques, is away at school, since Oliver inherited most of the rich estate, and money, he has the power of the purse to do anything . He, Oliver is jealous of his sibling's superior attributes, Orlando lacks education, possessions, totally dependent on his brother, but the very simpatico boy's qualities, nevertheless shines brightly through, causing Oliver who hates him, to hate him even more. He arranges a wrestling match between Orlando and the vicious wrestler Charles, who has crippled three previous opponents and gives special orders to kill his brother... Things don't go as planned, and Charles is the one carried off unconsciously to the surprise of all, Rosalind witnesses this event and falls in love with Orlando. The political situation in the dukedom, at the court of Duke Frederick, who overthrew his brother Duke Senior, and exiled him is hazardous, the shaky ruler fears plots against him, all are potential enemies, his daughter's Celia's best friend and companion is her cousin Rosalind, the daughter of Duke Senior, which makes for an uneasy situation. Duke Frederick the paranoid royal, banishes his niece Rosalind, from court and threatens her with death if she remains, the loyal cousin Celia, will not abandon the person she loves the most in the world. They the two cousins secretly leave the palace, dressed like men for safety reasons during their travels, Rosalind becomes Ganymede, and Celia, takes the appropriate name Aliena, for additional help the court fool, Touchstone, also goes, he is a lot smarter than he looks. Meanwhile warned by the longtime family servant, old Adam, that Oliver is plotting to kill him, Orlando... the two flee to the Arden Forest, where the exiled Duke Senior lives with his followers . Duke Senior, is rather enjoying himself, no responsibilities, a leisurely existence in the beautiful woods, the food while not luxurious, is enough for his simple needs, shelter quite adequate for his people too, he doesn't care about losing power. Then the needy men and women, escaping the tyranny of his cruel brother, arrive, Celia, Rosalind, ( who while disguised, likes to play amusing tricks on Orlando) Touchstone, Adam, Orlando, and many others. And the nervous evil one Frederick, is bringing a vast army to crush the oblivious inhabitants of the forest paradise. One of Shakespeare's better comedies, still after 400 years , it will please readers who like to be entertained, and this not serious tale, does indeed accomplish that very well.\n",

      "The best thing about the performance was the fact that Orlando was played by a woman who was less that five feet tall and Rosalind was played by a man was way over six feet tall. Needless to say, this lead to many comic moments. Here’s some shots of the performance:\n",

      "\n",
      "The play displays much of what Shakespeare does best. There are explorations into gender politics and sexuality because of the layers added into the play; there are men playing female characters who then in turn pretend to be men, which makes it even more complex. As with most of his comedies, I find the magic of the work is lost on the page. These are plays that are meant to be performed!\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike many of Shakespeare’s plays, even the comedies, this was very light and breezy. Nobody died. Nobody suffered. And the ending was a mass matchmaking that only left me feeling warm inside. It’s an entertaining piece to watch, though once you’ve got your head round the plot it won’t make you think any further.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a funny piece, but not quite as good as and I think it suffered a little with a background cast of pretty standard Shakespearean characters rather than standout personalities.\n",

Die ganze verkorkste Geschichte beginnt mit Skeeves altem Lehrer Garkin, der seinen Schüler beeindrucken will, indem er einen waschechten Dämon beschwört. Betrüblicherweise ereilt ihn während der Beschwörung ein unerwarteter Tod und so sitzen nun Skeeve und der beschworene Dämon (kurz für Dimensionsreisender) Aahz gleichermaßen in der Patsche. Aahz kommt vorerst nicht in seine Dimension zurück und Skeeve braucht einen neuen Lehrmeister. Da hilft nur eins: Aahz wird natürlich Skeeves neuer Meister.\n",

      "I am so glad my friend recommended this book because I had never heard of it before. It is a really fun read. It kind of reminds me of William Goldman or Douglas Adams (maybe even a subtler Christopher Moore) in it's blending a serious and absurdist tone at the same time. There are serious moments and dangerous moments but then a goat shows up and it's all good. Okay, not really, but that kind of thing could happen. I enjoyed this book because it doesn't take itself seriously and that's enough. There are some low-hanging fruit jokes in the book, but most of the humor is subtle even if it's absurd. I appreciate how it makes fun of medieval times-ish fantasy tropes but also clearly loves them. That loving hand makes for a lot more enjoyable fun.\n",

      "The basic plot is very simple (though the execution of it is anything but). Chon and Ben are the 21st century version of the odd couple on steroids. Ben is a passive, brilliant, Buddhist type (or Baddhist as Ben explains) and Chon is an ex-special forces, \"man of few words\" killing machine who basically hates everyone (except Ben). Ben has engineered the highest of high grade marijuana and he and Chon sell it in Southern California to upper class, Kardashian type clientele. All is peachy, breezy and OC easy until the Mexican drug cartel wants Ben and Chon to come work for them.....and no is not an option.....yeah, tell that to Chon.\n",

Chon (a nickname based on his real name, John) is an ex-Navy SEAL and Afghanistan veteran with a bad attitude and sincere belief that most people are just pretending to be civilized.

They’ve been the premier pot distributors in Southern California for years thanks to Ben’s talent with weed and Chon’s ability to discourage any unsavory types who threaten their operation. Unfortunately, the guys just got a video from a Mexican drug cartel showing several people getting decapitated. The message is clear: join up or get the Marie Antoinette treatment.\n",

Unfortunately, drug cartels aren’t used to taking no for an answer, and they kidnap O. If the guys won’t keep growing pot for the cartel, O.’s neck is going to meet the business end of a chain saw. Ben and Chon have to play along, but to get O. back, they’ll have to go to war without letting the cartel know who is waging it.\n",

      "Don Winslow is a writer I think has been flying under the radar for far too long. This should be the book that finally gets him some serious attention. This is an incredible story about the lengths that some people will go for friendship. I especially liked Chon with his bleak but amusing view of most people. Despite the gritty and violent nature of the story, the book is also laced with a black humor that has a lot to say about how goddamn silly this country can be at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved the unique writing style of this, too. Winslow has done several books in a conversational So-Cal tone of voice, and he’s also played around with a clipped and brusque style in . In this one, he’s fused the two into a unique read that reminds me of James Ellroy mixed with Charlie Huston and a dash of Chuck Palahniuk. Anyone interested should read it and not listen to an audio version because even the layout of the words on the page becomes part of the structure of the story.\n",

      "is the story of Ian and Mackenzie. If you’ve read , you may remember them as the best friends of Cade and Alexa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kenzie is a nurse who is working in the gym that Ian trains at. Ian and Kenzie had a moment. They were out with friends, they were hitting it off, and they almost got together. But Ian has rules. Rules he does not break. When he is seriously training for a fight, he trains hard, he eats clean, and he doesn't have sex. It’s his rule that he won’t break. Unfortunately, this comes across to Mackenzie as not being wanted. With the way she grew up, its hard for her to deal with those types of feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kenzie and Ian have sexual tension that is off the charts. It’s so obvious that they want each other. As much as Kenzie tries to deny her feelings for Ian by seeing someone else, she can’t lie to herself. And Ian can only hold back from her for so long…\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked Ian and Kenzie’s character’s a lot, but I found myself frustrated a good portion of this book with each of them. There were moments I wanted to jump in the pages and smack some sense into them both. So much unnecessary struggle and heartbreak. The only thing that kept me from getting fed up with them both is the fact that I understood completely where both characters were coming from. Any decisions they made that I didn’t like, they both did for the right reasons in their heads and hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "As always, I love Kendall Ryan’s writing style. Her books are sexy, easy to read an enjoyable. They always have the right amount of emotion to make me feel. I could have done with a little more steam in this story, because this woman can write a steamy scene like no other.\n",
      "\n",
      "is written in dual p.o.v. which I always love. Even though it is the second book in Kendall’s Hard to Love series, it can be read as a standalone.\n",

      "\n",
      "I am huge fan of Kendall Ryan, so much so that in the past few months I have been reading all of her books I missed. My favorite thing about Kendall’s writing is the way she delivers a quick sexy stories. Reckless Love is apart of the Hard to Love series, but can be read as a standalone as they focus on different couples. This is the story of Ian and Kenzie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ian is a professional MMA fighter and he trains at the gym where Kenzie works as a nurse. For months these two have been walking on eggshells with each other after their failed hook up. Now this is understandable Kenzie is humiliated after being left high and dry when she was willing to give Ian everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Kenzie feels Ian just out right refused her because he wasn’t into her, but that isn’t the case. Ian actually refuses to have sex before fight, he believes he will fight better if he sustains. He knows Kenzie believes he just isn’t into her and he is okay with that since he can’t offer Kenzie what she deserves. Ian has to be completely focused on his career so that is what he will do even if it kills him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite their desire to avoid each other their chemistry is undeniable and when they end up situations with each other they can’t fight it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This story had some frustrating moments, but in the end I could understand where the characters were coming from. Kenzie has a heart of gold and she wants the best for Ian, so she is willing to sacrifice her own feelings. Ian comes off as a rough and gruff fighter, but he is really a softy on the inside and when it comes to Kenzie he will do anything to make her happy. That is why even when I was frustrated I forgave them, both of them just wanted the best for each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I was saying Kendall always delivers on the sexy and I loved how much heart was in the story. I loved her character’s strengths and how protective they both were. If you are looking for a sexy read with lots of heart this is the story for you. I am sure I am just being greedy, but I would have loved a little more sexy times.\n",

      "~ 4.5 Hard Not to Love Stars ~\n",
      "\n",
      "This series of books really should've been called Hard Not To Love instead of Hard to Love, because both Cade and now Ian are AMAZING!!!! You can't help but fall in love with these two men.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let me ask you this, what do you get when you mix a MMA fighter with Kendall Ryan??? You get one OUTSTANDING book!!!! With every book I read by Kendall, she just solidifies why she is one of my favorite automatic read authors. I will stop what I am reading just to read her new releases!! Her writing style, to me, is flawless and spot on. She always gives us just the right amount of detail to make us feel everything the characters are feeling without weighing the story down. Anytime I pick up a Kendall Ryan book, I know I am in for a great book. One that will bring out many of emotions, but will also leave me happy and with a smile on my face. Reckless Love was no different. And let me tell you…Kendall knows how to bring on the steam. A fan is definitely necessary when reading her books ;)\n",
      "\n",
      "In Reckless Love we meet Ian and MacKenzie. I have to be honest and say I don't remember them in the first book , Hard to Love, but I read that one so long ago, that with the background of these two characters and how they are linked to Cade and Alexa, I am sure they were probably in the first book. With that said, this can totally be read as a standalone. I would recommend reading the first book just to give you the backstory on Cade and Alexa, because they do play a big part in this book. But if you don't want to, you will for sure be fine reading this without it. Kendall does a great job connecting the dots and filling in any spaces you might miss with not reading book 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ian and MacKenzie were amazing characters, but truly had serious issues with communication. A lot of their problems could've been solved had they just talked to each other. But then we wouldn't have a story that was filled with angst and sexual tension. I will say I was a little surprised by the direction Kendall went in this book. I don't want to ruin anything, but because she went in this direction I couldn't give it a full 5 stars. It is something I just don't really enjoy in my books. But with that said, don't let that deter you from reading this book, because I truly did LOVE this book aside for those two aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend this book 100%. Kendall Ryan really can do no wrong when it comes to her writing. Even when she adds elements I normally don't enjoy, she still is able to create a story that totally sucks me in and doesn't let go. I end up loving the book in the end :)\n",
      "\n",
      "So if you are looking for that MMA fighter love story that will warm your heart and melt your panties, then you should definitely give Reckless Love a chance!!!!\n",

      "This book makes for a terrific companion reference tome if you're on a marathon listening binge of the classic Dragnet radio shows -as I am- this is an essential book to own.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're a fan of the original '50s tv series with Ben Alexander as \"Frank Smith\" or a fan of the Dragnet series most of us grew up with in the late 1960s with Harry Morgan as \"Frank Gannon\", it's a must have.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original Dragnet tv series of the 1950s was as noir as classic tv ever got.\n",
      "Really tough material.\n",
      "The radio series was even more graphic.\n",
      "\n",
      "More importantly you'll gain an appreciation of the multi-talented, incredibly driven Jack Webb.\n",
      "I have gained more respect for Jack Webb after reading this book than I ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended!\n",

      "My Name's Friday is an enjoyable romp through the world of Jack Webb. From his days portraying hardboiled radio detectives Pat Novak and Johnny Madero to Hollywood Success, Failure, and a big comeback, Friday takes us through the highlights and lowlights of Webb's life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Michael J. Hayde comes to the book with a great deal of respect for Webb and his work, which is an essential element in a work such as this. Hayde's work first and foremost is a Webb fan book. He gives a synopsis of each of Webb's movies and then provides a critique of them. While appreciating Webb's contributions, Hayde spares no criticism of the late 1950s Dragnet episodes, Pete Kelly's Blues, and other less than successful Webb projects. While I don't agree with all of Hayde's criticism (I loved the \"Night School\" episode and he didn't), his criticisms are reasoned and measured rather than spiteful. Whatever criticism Hayde has for Webb is mild compared to the well-deserved critique he slams down on the 1987 Dragnet movie with Dan Akroyd.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there was one criticism I'd had of Hayde's book, it was where he went from TV fan to armchair psychologist, buying Webb's statements that he didn't miss having a father around as a youth. I actually after reading the book and of Webb's difficulty letting himself act believably on screen particularly in romantic scenes, as well as history of broken marriages might not have been influenced by never having a father around. Kind of off-topic from the subject of the book, I know. However, if one is going to engage in psychology, it shouldn't be done haphazardly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the book is incredible fun as a fan resource and provides a rare glimpse at a radio and TV genius that's been typecast as a stiff clown. Read it to recapture a vital part of America's television history.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This “unauthorized but true” book chronicles Jack Webb’s development and refinement of his ideas in regard to what a police drama should be, whether as a radio series or as a television production. Offering readers a comprehensive look at the production of the show that defined a genre, this book also contains program guides for both the radio and television episodes of “Dragnet” as well as a collection of Joe Friday’s most well-known speeches from throughout the series. The appended “A “Dragnet” Guide to the Los Angeles Police Department” includes such information as the department’s unit numbering system, division identification and function, and a glossary of police terms. It’s a fascinating glimpse into the world of television program development and the changing face of the police drama.\n",

      "Recommended.\n",

      "-----------\n",
      "\n",
      "Greatly superior in organization and analysis to Just the Facts, Ma'am, this book does well both discussing Jack Webb and Dragnet, and the love-hate relationship they had with each other. With lots of examples from the various scripts Webb wrote or oversaw, the book provides a solid guide to the man and his works, and is a must-read for anyone who is interested in either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hayde’s work is organized well and chronologically. All of Webb’s works, including the different renditions of Dragnet are gone into in detail, and Webb’s evolving relationship to the show, and to his own creative genius and his Hollywood “star” are made understandable.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Loving the series Dragnet is really against my nature being that it is very in favor of \"The Man\" or status quo as it were but I just can't help it I love both the old old radio show of it and the 1950's and 1960's TV show shows. This book really help explain who jack Webb (the star of show and it creator producer and writer) was, this book was really interesting.\n",

      "This book was a delightful surprise. It was just what I was looking for on a topic that I am very interested in, Fear. Often I have thought that all human emotions and feelings could be boiled down to two basic forces fear and love. This has always been an elusive and easily misunderstood topic for me. Fear is a shadow that is always present but rarely noticed. My interest in this subject stemmed from the idea that fear may be the opposite of love. This intrigued me because I thought the two couldn't be more different, let alone have any relationship towards each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is about fear without the love. Which is fine, I just think some people could easily misuse the contents of this book for ill. Essentially this book is about overcoming fear with the backdrop story being the life of rapper/entrepreneur Curtis Jackson also known as 50 cent. He defied all odds from an early age and even though he was set back, shot at, threatened, he never backed down from life and living what he believed his destiny. Powerful and life-altering lessons can be drawn from his experience and that is where Robert Greene comes in and points them out. Underneath everything Fear is nothing more than an unacceptance of our mortality. It is repressed, ignored, avoided and run from really at our own ironic peril. Fear means we can't come to grips with death. We hold on to things when we should let go, we care about things when we shouldn't, we let ourselves be dominated when we are stronger. Death to comes to us all, the rich and powerful as well as the weak and poor. The sooner we accept and confront this reality the sooner we can be liberated from it. Through that liberation life takes on a dazzling new perception and depth. Death isn't the Tragedy, the life not lived is. The greatest irony of all is that we are more afraid of ourselves than we are of anything else. Lifetimes are wasted making excuses for ourselves on why we aren't good enough, fast enough, smart enough, strong enough, caring enough and it is all a lie we feed ourselves to escape the responsibility of being more.\n",

      "This is the first book I have ever returned to Audible, and the first one I have put on my DNF shelf. I am a very patient and sometimes stubborn reader; I'll usually finish a book even if I don't like it, if for no other reason than to think about why I didn't like it (and write down my thoughts in a possibly scathing review).\n",
      "\n",
      "1 star may not be entirely fair. I didn't hate this book. It wasn't offensive or stupid or badly written.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was just . Soooooo boring and banal and trite.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can sum up the philosophy of this book in one word: Fearlessness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, not much of what follows really says anything novel or inspiring about how to get there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not a big listener of rap, nor one of those white boys with a posturing affection for the Gangsta lifestyle. But I admit that I have a sort of fascination with Curtis Jackson aka 50 Cent. I actually like some of his music. is the only rap album I've ever bought. (I just really like .)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He came out of the hood, working corners as a drug dealer, to become one of the preeminent rappers in the world. It's evident that he's a very smart man with great business savvy and serious attitude. 50 Cent has always reminded me of the chapter in about how drug dealers, if you look at them dispassionately without taking into account the criminality and violence, are basically no different than any other businessmen with the same business concerns as any company selling widgets: competition, territory, marketing, PR, unpredictable and fickle customers, supply and demand, government regulation, employees of wildly varying ambition and competence, etc. And the successful ones do basically act like businessmen, not like testosteronic gangbangas lookin' to pop a cap in yo' ass. (Those are the ones who die or go to jail.)\n",
      "\n",
      "So, 50 Cent does the gangsta posturing, but he got out of the streets and the hustle when he could and now uses his 'hood background as marketing. He's created a business empire. No doubt, much of his swagger is posturing and showmanship; he's turned a failed hit on him into a legend, though merely being lucky enough to survive having someone put a few bullets in you doesn't by itself make you a tough guy. But I believe he is a genuinely hard man, smart and ruthless but as fearless as he claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I was interested in this audiobook ostensibly summarizing his experiences and philosophy but written \"in collaboration with\" Robert Greene, a self-help author most famous for Dr. Phil/Oprah-like books like .\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I was hoping for mostly 50 talking about 50, but it quickly became evident that this book was entirely written by Robert Greene, basically a book that probably says nothing he hasn't said in his previous books but \"branding\" it with 50 Cent's name. There are a few quotes from 50, and each chapter opens with an anecdote from 50's life and rise to power, and then it segues into the sort of generic, banal advice you'll get in any self-help book exhorting you to unlock your strengths, be fearless, embrace your will to power, don't work for anyone else, don't settle for the safe choice, don't become complacent, etc. There is an emphasis on creativity and owning your own work which clearly comes from 50, but this book could just be rebranded with Sun Tzu or Napoleon and say the same thing, and indeed, as soon as Greene is done with his obligatory tying of each chapter to 50 Cent in some way, he then goes on to compare 50 Cent's philosophy to everyone from Napoleon to Sun Tzu to Abraham Lincoln. There are frequent references to Malcolm X and Frederick Douglas too, of course, but it's still essentially a \"ghost-written\" book (if you can call a book ghost-written when the actual author's name is right there on the cover) that 50 Cent cannily arranged through his savvy marketing campaign. So, well done, 50, your name got me to download and listen. But the book was not interesting or bold enough to hold my attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got about 1/4 of the way through it before deciding that I just was not interested in hearing the rest, and being grateful that Audible has such a liberal return policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I'll confess a lot of what 50 Cent/Greene was saying probably is applicable to my life. I have settled for working for The Man, and if I was younger and hungrier I'd be more inclined to do what they suggest and try to carve out a life where I am in complete ownership of myself and my output. So it gave me food for thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, if you're looking at this book because you think it would be interesting to hear 50 Cent talking about life and power and creativity and business, you'll be disappointed. It's all marketing.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I loved The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene (a book I think should be required reading for life) so I was intrigued to read this book, also having been a 50 Cent fan back in high school.\n",
      "\n",
      "In The 50th Law, the story of 50 Cent being shot was repeated excessively. I am not denying or doubting the extent of the impact this would have on anyone’s life, and I understand it's relevance to the lessons presented, however, I still felt it was excessively mentioned. I didn't like the book as much as but it still had a lot of good lessons that can be applicable in a variety of venues, both personally and professionally. It had some empowering takeaways and I think it was worth reading.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is a must read for anyone who wants to learn how to handle fear and be fearless in life. This book is a great introduction and simpler entry point to The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene. I was drawn to this book because I was interested to learn about 50 Cent, the man, instead of his rap persona and see how he was able to succeed in life without having a father and mother to raise him. Robert Greene eloquently tells 50 Cent's story by explaining to the reader how his power is absolute fearlessness on the streets, in business meetings, and how he approaches his music.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book is a semi-autobiographical account detailing 50 Cent's rise as both a young hustler and as an up-and-coming musician. It also contained lessons and anecdotes from historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln, Sun Tzu, Socrates, Napoleon, Malcolm X, and James Baldwin which were a lot of fun to read.\n",

      "Chapter 1\n",
      "See Things for What They Are - Intense Realism\n",
      "\n",
      "Reality can be rather harsh. Your days are numbered. It takes constant effort to carve a place for yourself in this ruthlessly competitive world and hold on to it. People can be treacherous. They bring endless battles into your life. Your task is to resist the temptation to wish it were all different; instead you must fearlessly accept these circumstances, even embrace them. By focusing your attention on what is going on around you, you will gain a sharp appreciation for what makes some people advance and others fall behind. By seeing through people's manipulations, you can turn them around. The firmer your grasp on reality, the more power you will have to alter it for your purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 2\n",
      "Make Everything Your Own - Self-Reliance\n",
      "\n",
      "When you work for others, you are at their mercy. They own your work; they own you. Your creative spirit is squashed. What keeps you in such positions is a fear of having to sink or swim on your own. Instead you should have a greater fear of what will happen to you if you remain dependent on others for power. Your goal in every maneuver in life must be ownership, working the corner for yourself. When it is yours, it is yours to lose - you are more motivated, more creative, more alive. The ultimate power in life is to be completely self-reliant, completely yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 3\n",
      "Turn Shit into Sugar - Opportunism\n",
      "\n",
      "Every negative situation contains the possibility for something positive, an opportunity. It is how you look at it that matters. Your lack of resources can be an advantage, forcing you to be more inventive with the little that you have. Losing a battle can allow you to frame yourself as the sympathetic underdog. Do not let fears make you wait for a better moment or become conservative. If there are circumstances you cannot control, make the best of them. It is the ultimate alchemy to transform all such negatives into advantages and power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 4\n",
      "Keep Moving - Calculated Momentum\n",
      "\n",
      "In the present there is constant change and so much we cannot control. If you try to micromanage it all, you lose even greater control in the long run. The answer is to let go and move with the chaos that presents itself to you - from within it, you will find endless opportunities that elude most people. Don't give others the chance to pin you down; keep moving and changing your appearances to fit the environment. If you encounter walls or boundaries, slip around them. Do not let anything disrupt your flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 5\n",
      "Know When to Be Bad - Aggression\n",
      "\n",
      "You will always find yourself among the aggressive and the passive-aggressive who seek to harm you in some way. You must get over any general fears you have of confronting people or you will find it extremely difficult to assert yourself in the face of those who are more cunning and ruthless. Before it is too late you must master the art of knowing when and how to be bad - using deception, manipulation and outright force at the appropriate moments. Everyone operates with a flexible morality when it comes to their self-interest - you are simply making this more conscious and effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 6\n",
      "Lead from the Front - Authority\n",
      "\n",
      "In any group, the person on top consciously or unconsciously sets the tone. If leaders are fearful, hesitant to take any risks, or overly concerned for their ego and reputation, then this invariably filters its way through the entire group and makes effective action impossible. Complaining and haranguing people to work harder has a counterproductive effect. You must adopt the opposite style: imbue your troops with the proper spirit through your actions, not words. They see you working harder than anyone, holding yourself to the highest standards, taking risks with confidence, and making tough decisions. This inspires and binds the group together. In these democratic times, you must practice what you preach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 7\n",
      "Know Your Environment from the Inside Out - Connection\n",
      "\n",
      "Most people think first of what they want to express or make, then find the audience for their idea. You must work the opposite angle, thinking first of the public. You need to keep your focus on their changing needs, the trends that are washing through them. beginning with their demand, you create the appropriate supply. Do not be afraid of people's criticisms - without such feedback your work will be too personal and delusional. You must maintain as close a relationship to your environment as possible, getting an inside \"feel\" for what is happening around you. Never lose touch with your base.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 8\n",
      "Respect the Process - Mastery\n",
      "\n",
      "The fools in life want things fast and easy - money, success, attention. Boredom is their great enemy and fear. Whatever they manage to get slips through their hands as fast as it comes in. You, on the other hand, want to outlast your rivals. You are building the foundation for something that can continue to expand. To make this happen, you will have to serve an apprenticeship. You must learn early on to endure the hours of practice and drudgery, knowing that in the end all of that time will translate into a higher pleasure - mastery of a craft and of yourself. Your goal is to reach the ultimate skill level - an intuitive feel for what must come next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 9\n",
      "Push Beyond Your Limits - Self-Belief\n",
      "\n",
      "Your sense of who you are will determine your actions and what you end up getting in life. If you see your reach as limited, that you are mostly helpless in the face of so many difficulties, that it is best to keep your ambitions low, then you will receive the little that you expect. knowing this dynamic, you must train yourself for the opposite - ask for more, aim high, and believe that you are destined for something great. Your sense of self-worth comes from you alone - never the opinion of others. With a rising confidence in your abilities, you will take risks that will increase your chances of success. People follow those who know where they are going, so cultivate an air of certainty and boldness.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is highly recommend for anyone who wants to take control of their life and learn how to be fearless in any situation in life. Hearing 50 Cent's story is inspirational and anecdotes and lessons are more than enough to give this book a look.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 10\n",
      "Confront Your Mortality - the Sublime\n",
      "\n",
      "In the face of our inevitable mortality we can do one of two things. we can attempt to avoid the thought at all costs, clinging to the illusion that we have all the time in the world. Or we can confront this reality, accept and even embrace it, converting our consciousness of death into something positive and active. In adopting such a fearless philosophy, we gain a sense of proportion, become able to separate what is petty from what is truly important. Knowing our days to be numbered, we have a sense of urgency and mission. We can appreciate life all the more for its impermanence. If we can overcome the fear of death, then there is nothing left to fear.\n",

      "(B) 72% | More than Satisfactory\n",
      "Notes: Secondary characters are mere objects of outrage or pity, vital insofar as they act out a narrative of moral correctness.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I got an ARC! A dubious honor when the result was my heart in my throat for the entirety of the 450 pages. I care way too much about too many of these people who put their darling little lives into too much danger. About midway through I was bargaining with my own feelings. Like \"ok, Bird can go, Mercy can go, the bakery can burn down, I will deal but if ANYTHING happens to VAL I will incite a mighty riot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Like all good mysteries, I managed to keep up with the twists and turns, sometimes foolishly thinking I was ahead of the mystery. FOOLISH I SAY. There are twist to be had without coming out of left field, a very rewarding read, even with the elevated blood pressure.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The third installment of the Timothy Wilde series flounders a bit in its execution, and the overall tension in the series seems to continually decline as the stakes feel lower and lower with each new book.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fatal Flame is as well researched and eloquently written as it's predecessors, but the book concerns itself with too many subplots: the book has to do with the mystery of an arsonist, but it's also about Timothy's love life; it's about politics and concerns itself with an election; it focuses on Timothy's relationship with his brother; it's also a story about women's rights. And poverty. And racism. And rape. It's no small feat to work all of these topics into one book, but the result is the absence of a primary plot line that's developed enough to hold the reader captive.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the upside, the author's character descriptions are as magnificent as always:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "is a nice addition to the series, nothing more, nothing less.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "If The Fatal Flame turns out to be the final installment in the Timothy Wilde series (and I have on good report that it is), Lyndsay Faye has saved the best for last and delivered a dynamic, enormously satisfying conclusion. If you’ve read Gods of Gotham and Seven for a Secret, you’re going to want to run to get The Fatal Flame (out 5/12/15). If you haven’t, and you’re a fan of literary mysteries, historical fiction or just well-written hero stories that immerse you in another world, then what the hell have you been doing? Go get Gods of Gotham immediately! You’ll have plenty of time to enjoy it and before you can get to .\n",
      "\n",
      "As with the first two Timothy Wilde installments, Faye crafts a complex, propulsive central mystery that keeps you guessing until the final reveal. Even as the “who” (the arsonist or arsonist who committed the titular “fatal flame”) comes into focus, the “why” is a rewarding surprise. Faye again crafts a twisty, well-paced mystery and, most importantly, plays fair with the reader. While the turns are unexpected, Faye never cheats: the clues and motivations are slyly seeded throughout and pay off when “copper star” Timothy Wilde puts them together for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are more than just good mysteries, however. Lyndsay Faye’s Wilde Trilogy transcends genre in two ways: in the elegance and impact of its historical setting and in the emotional richness of its world-building.\n",
      "\n",
      "When describing Faye’s work to the unfamiliar, I always make the point that she is a master of elegantly weaving rich historical detail and context into the story. She avoids the easy and all-too-familiar crutch of having Captain Exposition enter a scene to explain the background context and its significance in order to explain a character’s actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Faye paints such an evocative picture of 1840’s New York City that we’re able to understand and feel the human-scale consequences of the culture and institutions that comprise the era. We get to understand what it means to be a woman at that time, where life options are essentially binary: marry or struggle not to starve to death. In previous books, Faye has focused on the plight of the Irish immigrant and the “freed” African American in that time. Works of historical fiction frequently have characters that play out and/or stand in as archetypes and symbols of a conflict of the period. Faye creates fully-fleshed characters that act within and outside the culture’s framework. These characters are humans, not symbols. This allows for complexity and results, in Faye’s hands, in true emotional payoffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the three books, Faye populates the world of Timothy Wilde with complex, authentic, human-sized characters. The cumulative effect of this work pays off mightily in . Because each recurring character has been painted throughout the series with nuance and depth and , there are genuine, affecting emotional stakes on the line. There were a half-dozen times or more in where I caught myself tense and worried for the fates of different characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three-quarters of the way through the book, I was struck with the realization of just how characters in this world that was I deeply invested in—Bird Daly, Elena Boehm, Jacob Piest, Gentleman Jim Playfair, Valentine Wilde (of course), even the fantastically, singularly awful Silkie Marsh. I liken this deep bench of richly and precisely drawn characters to . It’s appropriately synchronous, I suppose, that , seemingly the final chapter of the Timothy Wilde story, hits shelves the same week as ’s series finale.\n",
      "\n",
      "is a terrific read and a tremendously satisfying conclusion to Timothy Wilde’s story. Despite the 30-degree weather, spring must have been in full bloom because my eyes watered throughout the last few pages. ’s final page is one of the loveliest endings to a book I can remember and thrills me to think what Lyndsay Faye has in store for us next. Whatever it is, I’ll be there.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The Timothy Wilde trilogy concludes with The Fatal Flame and I can’t help but feel a little sad because I’m going to miss the world and it’s characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Timothy seemed very distracted in this book, which made the mystery feel a little less cohesive that the previous two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gender and politics make up the main crux of the story. We get to see the terrible mistreatment of immigrants - particularly women, the unfair conditions under which female factory workers must work, and the exploitation of poor women who have nothing to sell but themselves. At times it was very hard to read and especially sad when you realize that a lot of the abuse still goes on today.\n",
      "\n",
      "The characters in this story felt a little far away. We don’t get to see as much of Bird, or even Mercy who shows up unexpectedly, I was particularly sad that Valentine was too busy campaigning for a city office. There was still plenty of bickering, but we also see the brothers finally admit - well Tim to admit that he doesn’t hate his bother as much as he likes to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this was good finish to the series, but neither sequel was as good as Gods of Gotham. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed the series and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes history and mysteries.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "If you follow my reviews regularly, you will know that I occasionally highlight a book that touched me very deeply, and this is one such book. In fact, I cannot think of a single criticism of the book. When I was almost done, I was disappointed that the ending was going to be standard for a Christian romance, but then I threw away that mindset and found myself crying at the ending. Books that can genuinely bring me to tears are rare, but this one did.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was captivated by the writing style. Robin Lee Hatcher chose to tell the story concurrently from three different time periods--Great Aunt Emma and Allie during her marriage and after her divorce. I never got lost, and I often looked forward to hearing more from her Great Aunt. It seems that Hatcher always hated the story at the right time--she left me hanging on several occasions. I was not always certain what would happen next, and the secrets that were revealed astounded me in the extreme.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Christian message was strong and was woven beautifully into the narrative. More than once, the gospel message was stated. Not only that, but the Christians featured in the book made some serious errors, and God still saw them through. They may have walked away for a time, but God always drew them back. And He was content to wait until they came back of their own volition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The personal impact of this story upon my heart and emotions was stronger than I thought it would be. I am a nine-year divorcée myself, and I could sympathize with Emma and Allie to a degree. There were a few times that I had to set the book aside as I faced emotions and thoughts that had long lay dormant. God even spoke to me as I immersed myself in Allie's tale. The author's purpose in writing this came across--God always answers but not always in the way we expect. What a glorious promise! No sappiness in this romance. In fact, it was sometimes almost too real.\n",

      "Review 2\n",

      "A Promise Kept is a stand-alone contemporary Christian fiction novel with a tiny bit of romance at the end. Allison Kavanagh, divorced a year ago from her husband of about 20 years, has moved in to the cabin she inherited from her Great-Aunt Emma in a different area of Idaho.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I liked:\n",
      "\n",
      "*Hatcher does an excellent job of alternating between Allison's struggles and those of Great-Aunt Emma decades ago. Hatcher manages to write each section so that it introduces a new concept or occurrence, reaches a conclusion of sorts, and yet causes the reader to want to see what happens next. This is not my favorite type of novel, but this one didn't drive me nuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I didn't like:\n",
      "\n",
      "*The novel wasn't the romance I was expecting. Apparently, that expectation was due to Amazon's and Goodreads' mistaken label.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend this very clean, very well-written book to people looking for encouragement through life's difficulties.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I received this book to read in 2014 and then life got busy. I moved, then started a new job, etc. I discovered I had somehow passed over this book and missed my review schedule. I tend to love Robin's books so I am glad that I kept it when I moved. This story slipped between time periods. Typically those fall flat on one side and the other character has a more pronounced story line. Yes, technically the modern character got the most dedicated pages, but I liked how Robin used the past character's diary/writings to teach the present character about decisions, regrets and also showed her how to heal. This story had a different twist on it but at the same time still had Robin's engaging writer's voice. I started it in 2020 and then life got busy again, but once I picked it up again, it held me captive until the end. There is just something special about the way the author gives you enough little details that you feel like you are actually in the story yourself as an observer. I love that.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I like Robin Lee Hatcher's strong, clean writing style. I also loved the two storyline's: one contemporary and one historical. But my favorite part of A Promise Kept was the poignant spiritual truth woven throughout the book.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "A Promise Kept. A promise that God will answer your prayers. Does he answer them the way you want Him to?\n",

      "Allison is a year into being divorced from alcoholic ex-husband Tony. She moves to an outskirt town near Boise, ID to her great aunt Emma's cabin who was single her whole life she knew of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here she finds a wedding dress and notebook journals filled with Emma's life story. She discovers she doesn't know all she thought she did of her great aunt's life. All while trying to process herself and her own marriage. Her young adult daughter, her ex and even her parents come for visits. Just when I think the daughter is being too naïve on seeming like she just wants her parents together, the dialogue moves on. Will there also be a new love interest from town?\n",
      "\n",
      "The dual timeline is not clunky as each section has it's own nice closure but leaves wanting more to the story. The narrator did not inspire me in the beginning but ends up following through o.k.\n",

      "Brenda and Jay have feelings for each other that go back damn near 12 years when they were in college, but Jenna met Jay first (I think), and Brenda fought and continues to fight her feelings for Jay because she doesn’t want to \"betray\" her friend. Jay, marries Jenna only because she got knocked up, but his heart is really with Brenda. Whoo…Meanwhile, Nick still has residual feelings for Brenda over a one-time hookup, but Brenda ain’t really checking him ya feel? She wants Jay. Jay wants Brenda. But Brenda is still faking the funk because she doesn’t want to hurt Jenna. Now do you see the messy quadrangle?\n",

      "This is the gist of the story. It’s good, juicy drama throughout because you wanna slap the hell out of Brenda for denying her feelings for 12 years. I understand not wanting to hurt a friend and all, but damn, is the friendship more important than your own happiness? Jenna knew the deal-that Jay wasn’t really feeling her and was only doing the “right thing” because he knocked her up. So what happens? Does Brenda finally say eff it, I’ve gotta make me happy for once? Or does she stick to the creed of friends don’t boink friends’ exes? Read this story to find out! It's good, delicious madness.\n",

The conclusion to the court battle regarding the twins was left hanging. Jay and Brenda make a great couple, and should have been together years ago had it not been for Jenna purposely keeping them apart with her antics. Getting pregnant and then having her father getting Brenda a job in Chicago. Where was her self respect and she sleep with Dale and Jay within 24 hr period without protection.Then Jay himself instead of going after who he really wanted he sleeps with Jenna and settles. Then Brenda slept with Nick and Nick rubs it in Jay's face. Not to mention the sucker punch he got away with. Just too many loose ends with this installment.\n",

      "Shakin' the Mess Outta Misery is a joyous, exuberant play about a young woman's coming of age. It tells the story of an African-American girl and the amazing wise women who raised her. It's structured as a series of reminiscences by Daughter (as she is called), now herself grown up into a smart, self-sufficient young woman; returning from the funeral of the last of her surrogate \"mamas,\" she recalls moments from her childhood, especially the sage advice passed down to her by this remarkable circle of ladies who helped shape her. First and foremost is Big Mama, tough, pious, and pragmatic, guided by faith and common sense to lead a good and proper life. Daughter lives with Big Mama and with her sister Mae Frances, a spirited purveyor of homemade liquor who dallies with local gentlemen at her \"factory\" every Sunday afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other, equally colorful characters remembered with affection by Daughter include Miss Lamama, a loving mountain of a woman with a gift for storytelling; Miss Corrine, a hard-working, lusty lady who runs a beauty shop in her kitchen; Miss Mary, an exotic woman of Caribbean origin who sees the future in her dreams; Miss Tom, a carpenter who lives with another woman named Miss Lily and teaches Daughter about different kinds of love; and Miss Rosa, the dour local undertaker. All provide Daughter with a family unit of love, encouragement, comfort, and advice: whatever their own differences (and they have these aplenty), they are united in their commitment to bring Daughter up right.\n",
      "\n",
      "The anecdotes that comprise the play are alternately funny, sad, magical, and touching, revealing the hearts and souls of a generation of women whose lives, though difficult, were led with dignity, pride, and courage.\n",

      "This is a beautiful book, more art than reference, that seeks to explain the phenomenon of \"rogue taxidermy\" to the general public. The concept of rogue taxidermy is the charming idea of hobbyists and enthusiasts taking taxidermy from a simple representation of an animal in life, or a mounted trophy, and turning it into art installations and other objects of whimsy. This book has everything from partially mechanized taxidermy mounts to reclaimed \"vegan taxidermy\" in the form of discarded children's stuffed animals being refashioned into entirely new 'feral' creations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book has a brief history of taxidermy, followed by a spotlight on a variety of modern practicioners of the art. Each artist has a nice write up on themselves, their style, and what their art means. Following the biography are samples of their work, nearly all of which is positively stunning. Following this section are small write-ups on mounting small mammals (squirrels), birds, and brain tanning hides. There is also a read more section as well as listed museums to find good selections, and websites for enthusiasts. I was delighted to see my beloved Atlas Obscura mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a nice reference book of taxidermy art, and full of great specimens to look at for inspiration. It's cool to see how this art has evolved, and to see just how many women are now dominating the field. I would recommend this, alongside as the two best resources for a beginner entering the field of Rogue Taxidermy and/or Vulture Culture.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This book was a great blend of information and humor, and included pictures that really demonstrate the different ways in which taxidermy art can be created and tell a story. The author begins with a brief history of taxidermy, as well as a list of the primary laws that affect taxidermy. He also delves into some of the people who helped form the foundation of the field, which helps the reader understand how certain trends in taxidermy were developed.\n",
      "I really enjoyed the section about the artists, and the range of taxidermy art it covered. I never imagined there were so many ways to utilize taxidermy as an art form, but this book definitely showcased the variety involved in the field. Included in this section is not only pictures of the art, but also details about what the artists' intentions are with their work and the ways in which they utilize (or don't utilize) animal remains.\n",
      "The author also includes helpful guides at the end of the book related to further reading on the field, laws related to taxidermy, and where to get supplies.\n",
      "Overall, a well-done book with lots of information, while remaining easy to read and lighthearted.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Fantastic! Even if I never practice taxidermy or own a piece in my lifetime, I still find this book extremely interesting and informative (I do want a little piglet with white bird wings wearing a golden lace crown seated on a covered crystal cake stand...is that wrong???) The different styles and ideas of the showcased artists were inspiring -- so the succinct workshops at the end of the book were well-placed. The design's color palette and photography are excellent throughout! I would be very proud to have this work become a part of my personal library.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Interesting as a kind of catalog or introduction to a number of international artists working in a medium often called taxidermy. This includes the use of materials such as porcelain or a stuffed toy with no actual animal or actual animal parts. Is that taxidermy? This volume seeks to blur the line between forms of artistic practice. The artist profiles are awkwardly sandwiched between some history and some practical advice on how to mount a squirrel and deflesh a skull.\n",

      "I throughly enjoyed seeing their take on the art. From the natural to the surreal, I never realized the artistic license that could be taken with this craft. I would love to see exhibitions by the artists featured.\n",

      "Catherine Drinker Bowen is one of the best storytellers I know. I've read a few books about Ben, and what I appreciated in this book was the detail given to the moments she chose.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, when he wrote his Silence DoGood letters, when he served on the Albany Congress, and his life in London as agent for America, all those moments get more depth here than in Walter Isaacson's wonderful biography.\n",

      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I just finished David McCullough's John Adams. John Adams started out admiring Franklin, but in Paris he found Franklin to be idle, a profligate spender, and a poor speaker of French. Catherine Drinker Bowen provides a contrasting portrait of Franklin the printer, scientist, and government emissary. I think both books provide pictures of men who contributed greatly to the American Revolution, each in differing ways.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "He wasn't the best person at all but he sure had personality. Franklin had such a commitment to bettering himself and it makes me sad to see how much his dad did not support him and how it made his life so difficult. He was obsessed with science, writing, and sex. All of which led him to some interesting situations lol. He took an interest in electricity which was my favorite story time. He came up with his own experiments to understand it yet a lot of them seemed more like a \"hold my beer\" type moments. He stopped his heart multiple times as a result of such reckless experiments. My absolutely delectable favorite was when he (without testing it beforehand) thought he could cook a turkey for dinner guests using only electricity. His vision was he would connect terminals to his BARE hands and also the turkey and clap, zap, sizzle it into perfection. He gathered all to see this jackass get thrown to the ground as dead as the turkey only to start twitching back to life. If I could go back in time I would love to see this.\n",
      "The last item I remember being interesting was his time at the printing press. His brother owned and operated one in which was very influential. They covered stories regarding small pox I think was really interesting. The vaccine was actually performed and supported by the church as their God given right...however the general population was not supportive and thought they were wrong. It's almost exactly opposite in today's culture around vaccines for COVID in some ways. Vaccines were heavily debated even back then! Sadly, Franklin lost a son to it and he regretted not vaccinating him...\n",
      "That's all I remember! Cool guy for sure\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I am continuing my Benjamin Franklin obsession by reading this and also Franklin’s autobiography. This is a favorable view of Franklin, but so what? I really like the way she organized it around Franklin’s ideas. She did not want to write a biography, but a series of scenes from his life. This was her “wholly selfish, quite arbitrary desire to write only what interested me about this most consistently entertaining biographical subject.” I loved the chapter on Science in the 18th Century and I loved the chapter on Franklin in London. The writing is very sophisticated and she doesn’t hedge on her opinions. It is the perfect next book after reading a biography of him. “A person of genius early knows his worth, knows at least that he is quicker than other men, more persistent, perhaps more reckless in pushing on…” The fact that Franklin had no formal education, couldn’t even use calculus to test his theories, and yet made such profound discoveries is something I like to think about at length. What makes a person run headlong after ideas for the sake of ideas?\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A great follow-up or addition to Franklin's autobiography. The author adds significant depth to Franklin's life story and to his part in the build up to the revolution. Plus, somehow I got a strong feeling about life in the colonies early in the 18th Century. Bowen was a great writer and it was easy to tell that Ben Franklin was a favorite of hers. This book is a keeper and a good read to recommend to others with an interest in American history.\n",

      "I love the colors of this book. It’s about a time that I really don’t like; those hot muggy days you can hardly breath and people are praying for rain to keep things from dying. I can’t stand that time. It makes me want to live in Scotland.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Mama is taking care of her wilting plants and a girl is wanting to cool off by putting on her swimsuit. They all want rain. The girl sees the clouds coming and she gets her friends to put on her swimsuit and come over so she can convince Mama to let her put hers on. The rain comes and the girls dance and giggle in the streets. All the Mama’s stick their heads out their doors and see the girls in the rain and they all smile and join them too.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the scene of a big group party in the rain. I don’t like the hot, but I do like dancing in the rain. This looks glorious. I love the infectious nature of the children reminding their parents to be young at heart and remind them of having fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "The niece thought this was a fun story. She and the nephew both wanted to dance in the rain. They thought it looked like fun. The niece gave this 3 stars and the nephew gave it 3 too.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I love this book! I felt immediately engulfed in the drooping, oppressive heat of a long, rainless summer... the expectancy and the urgent NEED for the rain to come and break the spell... the sheer delight of the first raindrops and the mounting glee as the rain pours down. This is a lovely, lovely story from two bright stars in the children's book galaxy. I think this was done before Muth became \"famous\" for his Zen books. I'm familiar with Karen Hesses novels but now I'll be on the look out for more picture books, too.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is a delightfully told story, told via some lovely poetry that just flows off the page. The illustrations are really wonderful and special too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The descriptions were spot on: of the unbearable oppressive heat, of the refreshing and fun rain, of the joy of play, of how certain moments can be so special, and captured so well the compelling anticipation.\n",
      "\n",
      "It reminded me of childhood and the magic some rainstorms seemed to have.\n",

      "I normally don't review the books that I read to my daughter but this one did something to me. While I was reading it, I felt myself settle into my Southern drawl that I normally disguise every chance I get and I just enjoyed the words, explaining some to my five year old, and allowing the rest to settle over me. I felt like we shared something special while reading this, something that only mothers and daughters can share. Karen Hesse has a lyrical way with words and I was thoroughly impressed.\n",

      "What a great read! I love the illustrations that complement the text, and completely capture that hazzy summer heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "A longer picture book than most, Hesse really gives the feel of summer and that anxiousness when looking at those first storm clouds on the horizon! While at times I thought the text was a tad too artsy, that's really just my own personal taste.\n",
      "\n",

      "==============\n",
      "This is a fine, thick speculative historical-political novel about the prehistoric American Southwest, specifically the enigmatic Chaco culture and its neighbors during the early 12th century. This is an impressive book. It's well-researched, and features complex people, muddling through life, in cultures much different than our own. The Gears' characters are exceptionally well-drawn. They're presented sympathetically, but with warts and all. Besides history, there's romance, treachery, greed, slavery, rape, murder, humor, exotic religion, mystery.... and fine masonry. A great deal of fine masonry. Did I mention the murals? The masks? The macaws?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chaco phenomenon has been puzzling and fascinating people since the rediscovery of the Chaco Canyon ruins in the 19th century. I've followed the debate with interest, and the Gears' story is as likely to be true(ish) as any. Although I'm kinda partial to the more recent \"Mexican cannibal terrorist warlords\" hypothesis for Chaco's Secret Masters -- which isn't incompatible with (but darker than) the Gears' interpretation. Both Gears are (IB) working archaeologists, and they've clearly spent some time around the campfire with the Chaco guys, listening to stories too outrageous to be published...\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you've never visited Chaco, well, you should. Fall is the primo time. Bring a sturdy vehicle, and plan to camp out for a night or two. And don't miss Earl Morris's stunning recreation of the Great Kiva at Aztec Ruins -- which you'll recognize from the novel. There are no finer Precolumbian buildings in this country. And no finer masonry anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "SILENCE is a gripping and successful long novel, which held my attention throughout. This is the best novel of the prehistoric Southwest I've read (this is an uncrowded niche). An impressive achievement, and a definite keeper. 5 stars! Highly recommended for historical-fiction and Southwestern US fans. And time for a re-read, I think.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I didn't like the beginning - too many story strands and characters were introduced too fast and I could not keep it all straight. About 100 pages into the book, I finally felt like I had it all straight and then was able follow the story. However, I was disappointed by the ending. The book begins with an entire chapter about characters during the modern day and then we never revisit them and never discover what the point was. Am I supposed to see that even in the modern era, the \"ghosts\" of the past culture live on in Chaco Canyon? It was definitely interesting to learn about the culture of the people of the southwest, but the story was just so-so for me. Finally, I was left feeling like there needed to be a sequel and I'm tired of books that leave you hanging.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The Gears Weave a Tale that is Captivating and Educational!\n",
      "Wow! Just, wow!\n",
      "This was one of my first in-depth views of the Anasazi, the Katchinas, and to Chaco Canyon. It created a thirst for knowledge in me and drew me deeper into the overall book series. It not only gave me a greater understanding of the culture of these ancient peoples and how they impacted life in the southwestern region of the United States, but it also offered a plausible explanation to their disappearance. The story was well-written, intelligent, and face-paced. It was gripping and heart-felt, while offering dangers and darkness in the midst of love and hope.\n",
      "Once again, the Gears shine as their literary talents display their amazing abilities as enticing storytellers. The reader is swallowed into this rich, detailed world and captivate from cover to cover. This is one of those novels that give readers a \"book hangover\" and must be pondered and experienced even after the tale ends!\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I enjoyed this book even though the initial difficulty lay in being forced to enter a universe in which dreams and spirits are a reality for its occupants. One really is forced, in the book, to look at the world with a different pair of eyes and alien imagery. The lives lived in this world seem peaceful on an initial, superficial, level but it isn't long before one realises that this is a harsh world in which there are constant threats from both its physical and spiritual aspects.\n",
      "The picture is painted in rich colours, perhaps, at times, a little too rich - it certainly forces you to concentrate at the beginning. It paints a society that is alien, even though human. Yet, slowly, we begin to accept this world, its everyday interaction with the spirits and elemental forces, its nagging threats, and the events that are unveiled before us take on a sort of normalcy.\n",
      "The O'Neal Gears are good writers - I really enjoyed their Anasazi series - and they didn't let me down in this tale of hidden secrets, power, envy, spiritualism and fear.I would certainly recommend it.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "There were some parts of this book I really loved; the botanical, geographical, culinary, and cultural descriptions, the varied, imperfect-but-trying characters, and the story itself. Some things that happened seemed overly fortuitous/dramatic/shocking, but they kind of made sense anyway, so it was all right. The story dragged a little at the beginning (when it was hard to keep track of all the difference POVs and figure out who's who), but once the action picked up it was quite interesting. My favorite part was learning more about the history, culture, and natural world of the Pueblo people.\n",

      "I was so hoping from that fun cover to the alluring synopsis that this would be a paranormal read. Something all about ghosts and all things that go bump in the night.\n",

      "\n",
      "Willa was relatable, real, and although she was going through a tough time, I liked her. I liked that she wasn't perfect and that she had problems and issues and I liked even more that it wasn't always easy to tell if what Willa saw and heard at night was real or just all in her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "For once I liked that this book wasn't focused on a romance, although there is one, sort of, it didn't really matter because what really mattered, was the serial killer running lose in Hollywood, and the disturbances that were happening at home with Willa. The romance never took away from the story but instead just added another layer of depth that was comforting and nice like a nice pair of fuzzy socks in the winter.\n",

      "Willa, who is now 17 years old, just moved to Los Angeles after her mother tied the knot with Jonathan, an extremely successful film director. They relocated to Jonathan's house, which had formerly been owned by a well-known actress. After they moved in, Willa began to see white flashes and hear voices. She has a strong suspicion that the flashes in question are from one of the victims of the Hollywood serial killer. The authorities are keeping a close eye out for a serial killer who has a vendetta against upcoming actresses, and they are on the lookout for him. Willa develops new connections and acquaintances while living in Los Angeles, but she isn't sure if she can put her faith in every one of them.\n",

      "This one, much like the stories of a great number of other young adults, may be read in a very short period of time. Mixing between the murder mystery and paranormal genres can be hit or miss. I’m still conflicted about how I feel about the ending of this story. While the characters were fun, the plot itself was extremely predictable. When the author gives you hints to believe that one character might be the killer, you clearly know he is not the one. And when the author in such stories makes a character so innocent, kind, and good, then you can confidently say he is the one! I was able to identify the murderer as soon as he appeared on the page. I feel this predictability kills off the fun part of these stories.\n",

      "This is a book that has received many positive reviews; however, most of those reviews were posted quite some time ago. If those readers went back and looked at the narrative now, they would see that it hasn't held up very well over the years. Overall, it was okay. There isn't much to exclaim or write about.\n",

      "A YA ghostly murder mystery with some twists and stars of Hollywood living. I thought it was a touch predictable but then it had me guessing the wrong bad guy a for a while so it wasn't cut and dry. The main characters where thinly developed but enough to carry the story. The adults were cardboard cutouts with no personality or awareness, thankfully they were hardly ever in the story. Overall it was a good audiobook, okay narration, entertaining.\n",
      "I picked this up for the cover and the fact it was available from my library's digital system. I like reading a story blind with no expectations. I enjoy a book more when that way, surprise is my friend. I don't know if I would have enjoyed it as much if I had any idea what it was about.\n",

      "3.75 stars! I really liked this! This book was not what expected (I'm not really sure what I expected) but I'm glad I actually read this. I wish I had read it sooner! To be honest I've had this book for 3 years I didn't think I was going to ever read it. I think I probably would have liked it better at fourteen it was a bit predictable I saw who the killer was before it was revealed but this book was fun! I do think I would have liked it more if it hadn't had such a happy ending? like I don't even know... but for a ghost/murder story wouldn't you expect it to be more scary? like this book's tone wasn't suspense it was high school drama? I had a few problems with it like some of the side characters seemed really really under developed like I wanted to know more about them but other than that this was really entertaining!!\n",

      "This is book 3 in the Heart trilogy and it begins in Ireland in 933 A.D. with Rhiannon seeking revenge for what she suffered on the Steppe for which she blames Ailinn who lives in Normandy with her devoted husband. Rhiannon means to capture Ailinn and bring her to Ireland. But Rhiannon makes a mistake and captures the wrong woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Normandy, Aileanor, daughter of Ailinn, and her siblings are playing in a pear orchard when Garreth of Tamworth, an agent for Athelstan, King of England, passes through and saves Aileanor from having to climb down a tree without a ladder. After that, he is enamored of the young woman and means to make her his. Meanwhile, Rhiannon’s goons capture Aileanor thinking she is her mother (they both have red hair) and sail away with her. How fortuitous it is that Garreth took the same ship!\n",

      "This is the conclusion to the Hearts Trilogy by Anita Gordon / Kathleen Kirkwood, and I must say that unlike most series, this one is as good at the end as it is in the beginning. I truly cannot decide which of the three books in the trilogy I liked best--I devoured each of the three in one sitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Captive Heart, Lady Ailinn and Lord Lyting's worst nightmares manifest in the kidnapping of their eldest daughter Ailenor by the hired hands of Ailinn's enemy of long ago, Rhiannon. Long thought dead, Rhiannon actually survives and regains her freedom after being kidnapped by brigands on the Russian Steppe in the second book of the trilogy, The Valiant Heart. Vowing revenge upon Ailinn, Rhiannon hatches a plot to kidnap her and revisit all the perceived wrongs done to her upon Lady Ailinn. But her henchmen mistakenly kidnap her daughter, Ailenor, who bears an uncanny likeness to Ailinn, and spirit her away in Ailinn's place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately for the Lytings, Ailenor is not alone with her captors upon the boat. After a largely unsuccessful diplomatic mission to the Normans, Garreth of Tamworth is also upon the vessel to be returned to England before the captain sails Ailinn and her captors to Rhiannon's lair in Ireland. Garreth manages to free himself and Ailenor upon the coast of England, but Rhiannon's goons remain close on their trail, seeking to recapture their prize.\n",
      "\n",
      "As passion smolders and flares between Garreth and Ailenor, how will he keep her safe from the thugs on their tail? Knowing that the true target was Ailenor's mother, how will they warn Lord Lyting and Lady Ailinn that she is in danger before Rhinannon's crew realize their mistake? Knowing what a valuable political pawn Ailenor is in the struggle for Charles' dispossesed son to regain his crown in Normandy, how will Garreth walk the tightrope betweeen maintaining his loyalties both as friend and subject to King Athelstan of England and keeping his beloved Ailenor safe and pleasing Baron Lyting whom he must ask for her hand?\n",

At least the hero and heroine are well matched in that neither have any self preservation skills or even basic common sense. They both deserved to die for their idiocy.

This edge-of-your-seat love story was completely captivating, and it gets better each time I read it again.

      "همه ي انسانها در حدود ٩٥ درصد ژنومشان كاملا مشابه هم هستند. هرچند اين ٥درصد باقيمانده به حدي هست كه تفاوتهاي چشمگيري ايجاد ميكند اما محيط هم تاثير به سزايي در رفتار و ويژگي هاي انسان دارد. اين كتاب بيشتر درمورد تاثير ژنتيك صحبت كرده بود و خيلي مختصر به محيط پرداخته بود.\n",
      "در مورد ژنتيك و موتاسيون ها و نحوه ي كاركرد ژنها و جمع آوري اطلاعات آماري در پژوهش ها اطلاعات خيلي خوبي بدست ميده وخيلي ميتونه مفيد باشه . البته بايد اينم بگم بيشتر اين موارد بارها در كتابهاي ديگر تكرار شده اند و مطالب جديدي نيستند اما به صورت جالبي جمع بندي شده بود در اين كتاب.\n",
      "براي اثبات نظريه ها از نظريات داروين و انتخاب طبيعي بسيار بهره گرفته بود.درواقع ميتوان گفت نويسنده خود تحقيق زيادي براي كتاب انجام نداده بود ، بلكه از تحقيقات سايرين بيشتر بهره برده بود.\n",
      "\n",
      "كتاب ، شخصيت انسان رو به ٥ دسته تقسيم ميكند:\n",
      "١)برونگرايي : افرادي جاه طلب و فعال و پرانرژي و داراي احساسات مثبت هستند كه پاسخ شديد به مشوق ها نشان ميدهند، پاسخ شديد ناقل هاي دوپامين در مغز انها ديده ميشود، ژن D4DR بيشتري دارند كه دوپامين را كد ميكند. علاقه دارند كه شريك هاي جنسي زيادي داشته باشند. اهل ريسك هستند.\n",
      "در مقابل درونگرايي يعني صبوري و خويشتن داري،بي تفاوتي، كناره گيري و دوري گزيني از جوايز اين دنيا، وابسته بودن. اين افراد احساسات مثبت كمتري دارند ولي اين به اين معني نيست كه احساسات منفي دارند.\n",
      "\n",
      "در مورد برونگرايي جوري صحبت شده بود كه انگار صفتي غالب است اما به دليل مشكلاتي كه دارد پس از انتخاب طبيعي در كنارش درونگرايي هم باقي مانده و به طور كلي از بين نرفته است.\n",
      "\n",
      "٢)روان رنجوري: اين دسته احساسات منفي بيشتري دارند، گاهي كاهش فعاليت و يا حجم آميگدال مشاهده ميشود، ممكن است مشكل در ژنهاي مربوط به سروتونين و كورتيزول وجود داشته باشد. تا حدودي با افسردگي مرتبط است اما در افسردگي برخلاف روانرنجوري ، احتمال بازگشت بيماري زياد است. بسيار آسيب پذير مي باشند. درجه ي خودشناسي كمي دارند. عدم ثبات در اهداف و تداركات زندگي در آنها ديده ميشود. به علت تجربه ي استرس زياد، در معرض ابتلا به بيماري هاي مزمن مي باشند.\n",
      "البته نبايد اين نكته را ناديده گرفت كه روانرنجوري بعلت اضطراب و استرس ، به فرد اين امكان را ميدهد كه از رفتارهاي پرخطر بيشتر دوري كند پس رفتارهاي جامعه ستيزانه در اين گروه كمتر ديده مي شود همچنين تلاش و بصيرت بيشتري دارند. در تلاشند امور دنيارا تغيير دهند پس ابتكار و نوآوري بيشتري نشان مي دهند. معمولا تفكر ژرف تري نسبت به ساير افراد دارند.\n",
      "\n",
      "٣)دورانديشان يا مديران : افرادي خويشتن دار، منضبط هستند و مكانيسم هاي كنترل و بازگرداني از پاداش اين افراد بسيار خوب عمل ميكند. (پس اگر فردي برونگرا باشد و طبق تمايل به پاداش، به مواد مخدر روي بياورد ، اگر شخصيتي دور انديش داشته باشد ممكن است خود را كنترل كرده و در دام اعتياد نيفتد!)لب قدامي مغز نقش مهمي در اين نوع شخصيت ايفا ميكند. نقطه ي مقابل دورانديشي ، تكانشگري است. اين افراد موفقيت شغلي بيشتري نشان مي دهند و در اهداف خود پايدارترند. پس اين افراد در محيط هاي شغلي افرادي موفق و كارامد محسوب ميشوند اما اگر محيط شغلي آنها غير قابل پيش بيني باشد ، دورانديشي غير سودمند است.\n",
      "دسته اي از افراد دورانديشي مفرط يا OCPD دارند كه اين افراد براي تمام كارهاي خود برنامه ريزي ميكنند و بسيار حساس به اين برنامه ريزي هستند. در نتيجه در نظر ديگران، خشك و بي احساس و غير قابل تحمل و لجباز هستند. زندگي يكنواختي دارند. ممكن است دچار بي اشتهايي عصبي شوند و كمالگرايي به شدت در آنها ديده مي شود.\n",
      "\n",
      "٤)سازگاران : افرادي قابل اعتماد و همدل هستند. اين افراد ، افرادي ياري دهنده، داراي ارتباط اجتماعي متوازن هستند و از حمايت اجتماعي لذت ميبرند. به ندرت خشمگين ميشوند.\n",
      "نبود سازگاري ميتواند با پارانويا مرتبط باشد همچنين پايين بودن ميزان سازگاري نشانه ي جامعه ستيزي فرد ميتواند باشد. سازگاري در زنان بيشتر از مردان مشاهده ميشود.\n",
      "\n",
      "سازگاري در تقابل با نظريه ي داروين ميباشد زيرا همدلي با هم نوع منابع در دستري خود فردا كاهش ميدهد.\n",
      "\n",
      "٥)گشوده ذهن ها يا شاعران : مي تواند پيش بيني افراد براي مشاركت در فعاليت هاي فرهنگي (كتاب خواندن و تئاتر و فيلم ديدن)باشد. باورهاي ماوراءالطبيعه دارند و در بعضي موارد روانپريش ميباشند و شبه شيزوفرني گونه در آنها ديده مي شود. كارهاي خلاقانه انجام مي دهند. تجربه هاي نامتعارف(توهم و شبه توهم، پريشاني دريافتي و انديشه هاي مبتني بر جادو) در بيشتر آنها ديده ميشود. گرايش اين دسته به افكار معنوي بيشتر از سايرين است. باورهايي خلاف هنجارهاي جامعه دارند. تغيير شغل هم به وفور ديده مي شود. معمولا در انتخاب زوج مناسب تر عمل ميكنند.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "و در آخر، شخصيت قابليت تغيير زياد ندارد هرچند با گذر عمر تغيير مختصري در آن ايجاد ميشود، اما ميتوان راه هاي بروز شخصيت را تغيير داد و با رفتارهاي كم خطري آن را بروز داد. (مثلا ورزشي كم خطر تر نسبت به موتورسواري براي فرد برونگرا)\n",
      "پس بهتر است شخصيت خود را بشناسيم و هدف هاي خود را با راه هايي مرتبط با شخصيتمان عملي كنيم و معايب آن را به حداقل برسانيم.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I want to like it but I can't. The concept was good, examples were there, but it didn't capture my attention. Seriously it's hard to finish. It's not like I don't read/like non - fiction. I do read & I like neuroscience perspectives & books but this one is not for me.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A great, easy-to-read book that delves deeper into the Big Five personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (OCEAN). Daniel Nettle uses a blend of anecdotes and science - ranging from the evolutionary perspective to genetics to environmental factors - to explain each area of personality. He creates a solid argument concerning why he views the Big Five as a fluctuating selection type model (every place on the continuum of each trait has its pros and cons) as opposed to a fitness-indicator one (having a lot or a little of each trait is \"black and white\" good or bad).\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best parts of this book was Nettle's admittance of his uncertainty in some areas; his lack of pretension made his less-substantiated claims easier to swallow. As someone with more background in Myers-Briggs typology I learned a lot about each trait as well as intriguing information associated with each one - for example, as someone invested in eating disorders, I connected to how people high in conscientiousness had a higher rate of developing anorexia. While his argument about the dark side of agreeableness left a little to be desired, for the most part I agreed with his alignment with the fluctuating selection type model.\n",
      "\n",
      "He ends the book on a high note with a strong recommendation that we search within ourselves to improve our personalities. Highly recommended for those who want to know more about the Big Five or just personality in general.\n",

      "این کتاب که به فارسی ( شناخت تیپ های شخصیتی) نام دارد درباره موضوع به اصطلاح big five است. شخصیت انسان دارای اندازه هایی از این ویژگی هاست که بسته به کم یا زیاد بودنشان به رفتارهای ما جهت میدهند از جمله: برونگرایی، روان رنجور بودن، دور اندیشی، سازگاری و گشاده ذهنی. در کل کتاب خیلی خوبی هستش چون بر خلاف کتاب های عامه پسندی که سعی دارن بدون در نظر گرفتن تفاوت های افراد روشی یکسان برای همه انسان ها برای رسیدن به موفقیت ارائه دهند سعی این نویسنده که یه روان شناس و محقق است در شناساندن انسان ها به خودشان است تا مطابق با ویژگی هایشان تصمیمات مناسب بگیرند.\n",

      "I enjoyed reading this but thought it was an overly simplistic book, especially since the author seems to think that our personalities are a result merely of natural selection.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did find the five \"dimensions\" of personality to be interesting:\n",
      "Extraversion (outgoing vs. quiet), Neuroticism (prone to worry & stress vs. being \"emotionally stable\"), Conscientiousness (organized & self-directed vs. spontaneous & careless), Agreeableness (trusting & empathetic vs. uncooperative & hostile), Openness (creative & eccentric vs. practical & conventional)\n",
      "\n",
      "Granted I am not a professional psychologist, psychiatrist, or neurologist, but the Myers-Briggs model makes more sense to me than Nettle's paradigm. However, I did find this author's exploration of the brain's links to our personality traits to be compelling. He believes that much of our personality is determined by our personal brain structure and levels of various neurotransmitters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this was not a perfect read (since I didn't buy into his premise that we are merely a result of scientific evolution). I think that human beings are much more complex, but the author presented food for thought (which is, I think, what reading is all about).\n",

      "Rather short book. Took me a long time to get through it because I'm not a fan of non-fiction but this attracted me enough. I expected the content to be on the more recent movements in the middle east, but it ranged from WWII and the kamikaze pilots to 9/11 up to now. The most important thing for me was the unbiased tone of the book. It was genuinely written and did not hold any bias towards the bombers, or muslims specifically.\n",

      "This is the third installment in the Appaloosa Pass Ranch Series. This storyline was different than the other books in this series. It was interesting and enthralling. There was so much going on and there were so many suspects. Alexa was a wonderful woman, brave all she wanted to do was keep everyone safe but when someone is trying to kill you that may be hard. Now as for Levi he was a brave man that was trying to stay away from Alexa but it was becoming difficult. He was conflicted at the very beginning but in the end the feelings overtook him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexa knew that she was going to be playing with fire when she went looking for Levi. All she knew was that she needed his help in order to take care of a little baby that had just lost her mother. Levi couldn’t believe that Alexa was asking for his help after her role in his sister in laws death. No she didn’t kill her but because Paige was helping Alexa in finding out who was the serial killer and she died because of it. As their journey goes by there are so many suspects that come to light, not only that but there are bodies that keep growing in count. As the story is almost over there is one character that ends up showing up and I was so surprised. I couldn’t believe it but in the end it was something that I loved. I loved how Alexa and Levi were able to see that they were in love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trouble with a Badge was a great read. I loved the characters but I love that some of the brother keep coming up in these stories. I do miss seeing Addie and Weston the very first characters in the book. I’m also wondering about Addie’s twin brother and how he is going to play into this series. Alexa and Levi have this great chemistry. I love Ms. Fossen’s writing.\n",

      "This author's best effort yet. Plot twists had me reading on even when fatigued. I would have finished this book in one sitting if other responsibilities had permitted. Charlie Yazzie and Thomas Begay are becoming as familiar as Tony Hillerman's duo, Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee. Chappell's character development is excellent. In each new book Charlie and Thomas continue to grow individually and as comrades in adventure.\n",

      "This story provides the reader with interesting information about southwest archaeology and anthropology. Charlie Yazzie‘s former archaeology professor is the target of the Indian rights movement. They are trying to stop the study of the ancient Anasazi people in one of the area’s oldest canyon sites. Charlie has his own personal problems as Sue gives birth to their child.\n",
      "Chappell is a good story teller and he makes it enjoyable to learn about the Anasazi entwined in a mystery story. Chappell brings the history as well as the beauty of the Southwest to life while telling a great story. The reader learns about the culture of the Natives Americans in the Southwest and makes one want to go visit the area.\n",

      "I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. Kaipo Schwab does an excellent job narrating the story. I always enjoy learning about the narrator. Schwab was born in Hawaii of a Hawaiian/Chinese mother and the German/Irish father. He received his BFA from Boston University.

The latter, drunk as he frequently is, comes racing into the town seeking out Charlie Yazzie, [a tribal investigative lawyer] with a frantic tale of how he and the (also drunk) Professor were attacked by unknown assailants at their distant camp.\n",
      "Charlie's wife Sue, is about to give birth to their first child so Charlie is understandably reluctant to leave her alone and quickly seeks out Thomas' wife Lucy Tallwoman to watch over her, while he, Thomas and Harley go to investigate the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do the men find when they reach the camp? Who is behind the attacks and why? Why is Charlie suspicious of some of the new student arrivals at camp?\n",
      "Where do Caleb and Ida stay while their father's away? Who looks after them there? How does this person know the Professor?\n",
      "What happens to Paul T'Sosi when he's herding his sheep on the mountainside? Who finds him and takes him to the hospital?\n",
      "Why are the AFPAC anarchists so desperate to kill the Professor? Who destroys the camp - and how? Which people meet a dramatic end on the mountain?\n",

      "R.A Chappell's fantastically entertaining murder-mystery, the third in the Navajo Nation Mystery series, fulfills every reader's fantasy, with its ancient legends, wonderful descriptions of the habits and habitats of both ancient and modern Native American Tribes, all-action thrills and character interactions.\n",

      "Spring Heeled Jack is back! Actually, there are more than one of them now (a strange choice of words considering). They are hunting for Sir Richard Francis Burton. And they are very confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, London is covered with red snow and plants. Burton experiences hallucinations of the same event over and over again. Only, each seems to belong to different histories. He soon realizes he and his friends have to do something about those intrusions, the red snow and plants. This time they have to travel far into the future.\n",
      "Burton, Swinburne, Raghavendra, Trounce and others have no idea what awaits them there and then. I loved it. There are more surprises and shocks than I expected. Every time I thought I knew where the story is going, something I didn't expect happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is absolutely no way one can write a real review of this book. This is one of those series where it's impossible to fully enjoy the books unless you read them in order. The reward is marvellous.\n",

      "Best book in this brilliant series, master of steampunk and time travel.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "The opening chapter does not disappoint! The action starts fast and furious, with an insane genital-less version of Spring Heeled Jack materializing out of nowhere and defenestrating Burton with ease, while red snow flutters down to coat the whole of London. Mystery and adventure abound!\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this series. This is the penultimate entry in the mad altered-history time-travel romp that is the Burton & Swinburne hexalogy. There were some uneven moments, including the book's final confrontation. I'm not sure yet how I feel about the ending. It leaves me eager to read the final volume shortly and I hope for a satisfying conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anything the book is too short. It felt definitely lower in word count that the prior series entries, and I can only assume that the main goal in its writing was moving pieces into place for the next, last adventure. Still, it was infused with plenty of heart (be sure to read the author's afterword at the very back) and some terrific moments, both in terms of physical action and metaphysical pondering. The book seemed to rush during the first portions of the crew's core journey, but this was quickly rectified with some solid emotional moments. The story finally addresses the enigma of Burton's favorite concoction, Saltzmann's Tincture, as well as providing some other wonderful drug-fuelled visions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was my first time reading this volume, although I have read the prior four twice now. The last time I reached this point I decided that I needed to go back to the start. Fortunately, if you need a refresher on the series as you launch into this book, Burton & Swinburne recap the whole timey-wimey affair in conversation, although I have to admit that when they get to the lizard people I cease being able to make sense of events, but that's okay, I enjoy the ride anyway.\n",

      "I've been hearing about this book for years from various folks who said they really enjoyed it. So when it popped up in my audiobooks, read by the same narrator who performed the Iron Druid chronicles, I figured I'd give it a try.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's fun. Which might seem like I'm damming it with faint praise. But personally, I don't often read books that take a fairly silly premise and just charge ahead being kinda silly with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's nice, lighthearted, funny, and easy to listen to. Plus the author has a nice turn of phrase that actually made me chuckle out loud a couple of times.\n",

      "Perfect if you're looking for some fun popcorn reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fair warning: You might want to avoid this if you have a problem with plot holes. Or if you have a tendency to say, \"But they could have solved all of these problems if they just XXX!\"** And then get irretrievably irritated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "** By XXX here, what I mean if you'd fill in some solution to a problem. Like calling the police Or using the Timeturner to, do something useful, like stop Voldemort or save someone's life. I don't mean XXX like you think all problems should be solved with, like, porno.\n",

      "Being a programmer by trade and a fan of fantasy, I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, it did not deliver.\n",
      "\n",
      "The premise is interesting enough, so it could have been great, but the book falls apart on two points:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the main character is completely unlikable. So at no point was I emotionally invested in him. If he succeeded or failed or died, I couldn't care less.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the book is written is a very odd, straightforward manner that runs through every scene as fast as possible without pausing for any realistic emotions like awe, shock, terror, ect. For example, if the main character had just discovered that he was in fact an alien that his parents had discovered in a field, it would be written like this:\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "4.5 stars, rounded up due to its creativity.\n",
      "\n",
      "A delightfully charming story that is a unique blend of science fiction and fantasy, Off to Be the Wizard will satisfy geeks who secretly (or not-so-secretly) wish they can be a wizard. I personally found the novel brilliant in its simplicity and originality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story is about a modern-day computer geek, Martin Banks, who came across a discovery that changed his life forever; that life on earth is a computer programme that allows anyone with access to the file to alter almost any aspect of reality by simply modifying said file. So what does a dorkish dude with the ability to perform seemingly magical tasks do? He proceeded to land himself in trouble with the authorities and had to escape back into a time and a place where magic could be viewed as probable, i.e Medieval England.\n",
      "\n",
      "Told from a third person perspective of Martin, the story was simple, fairly predictable and not one to be taken too seriously as it will not stand up to critical analysis and scrutiny. Nonetheless, it has a lot of charm in the manner it was told so one should just kick-back and enjoy the ride. I was lukewarm towards Martin initially as he appeared to be quite foolish and immature. The progression of his character as the story unfolded was, however, ingenuously fun arising from a myriad of interesting situations that he found himself in. Martin’s friendship with Philip (my favourite character so far) formed the best part of his character development. I did sometimes get strong vibes of Back to Future, especially when Philip started to call Martin as Marty. There was also a fair amount of pop and geek culture references scattered across the narrative which made it all the more enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "There isn’t much more I can mention about the plot without revealing minor spoilers. Even though it was simple, the tale was not devoid of meaningful commentary. The overriding message was about the responsibility of people who found themselves with power, and being a wizard meant having to adhere to the basic rules of not abusing said power granted by having access and the ability to change the file and hence reality. This managed to come across the narrative quite seamlessly without rubbing it in too hard or being too repetitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unembellished prose fit the style of the story really well. Like I've mentioned earlier, Seriously, just look at the 8-bit graphics cover! The first few chapters did have a slightly drier tone with more technical jargons being employed to set the scene for our main protagonist’s eventual escape to Medieval England. Once Martin landed himself somewhere in an English countryside sometime during the mid-12th century, tried to bluff his way into being recognised as a wizard, and especially after he met Philip, the story started to hit its stride. It definitely made me laugh out loud numerous times and I found the whole experience highly entertaining and refreshingly so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, the audiobook narration was fantastic. I probably might not have enjoyed it as much as I did without Luke Daniel's ability to add personality to the characters, as well as incorporate timely and appropriate inflections in the dialogue.\n",
      "\n",

      "Executive Summary: A really funny sci-fantasy story that will largely depend on your enjoyment of the humor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audio book: Everyone seems to love the Iron Druid books. I just didn't. The one thing I did really love was Luke Daniels narration of those books however.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll admit that probably more than half of the reason I chose to review this book for was because Luke Daniels was the reader. He did not disappoint. Another excellent performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This book started really slow, despite a cool concept. A computer geek discovers a file that somehow lets him manipulate not only the world and everything in it, but time itself. So of course he decides to go back to medieval times and become a wizard. As a computer geek who (not so) secretly would love to be a wizard I was intrigued.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately the main character, Martin isn't very likable at the start. Despite being good with computers, he doesn't seem very smart. For me the story finally started to get good when he meets Phillip. I will say Martin did grow on me as the book went on. I don't plan to say anything else about the plot because I don't want to ruin the jokes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think your enjoyment of the book will largely depend on if you find the humor funny and your willingness to not only suspend your disbelief but throw it right out the window. Things get silly. Really silly.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a lot of computer geek humor as well as some pop culture humor from the 80s and 90s that reminded me a bit of , a book I absolutely love. I think fans of that book, may find similar things to like here. Scott Meyer does for fantasy geeks what did for gaming geeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only real complaint I have apart from the slow start is the general lack of women. That's a pretty common complaint in fantasy. However as this is a fantasy book based in current time and involves using computers to manipulate the world to to be a wizard this seems like a big flaw for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Meyer has a plausible reason to explain away his lack of female characters, but he could have just as easily had a plausible reason for their inclusion instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall though, I really enjoyed listening to this book and I'll be on the lookout for his next book as well as planning to check out his webcomic in the near future.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A weird, Kafkaesque post-modern re-telling and re-visioning of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.\n",
      "\n",
      "But fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not sure what I was expecting when I picked up this 2013 publication but it was not what I expected. Essentially, protagonist discovers that all of creation, including himself and his bank account, are a part of a computer file. After some early tomfoolery, he gets himself into trouble, then we have some time travel and lots of wild adventures. Off To Be The Wizard is entertaining, I smiled several times along the journey and was coaxed into at least two laugh out loud scenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like much of today’s fiction, though, it could have benefited from some robust editing, knocking a few dozen pages out would have made it a stronger, tighter woven story. This would actually have been a really good short work. And, of course, we are invited back for sequels.\n",

      "You have such a gift for creating characters who really resonate with kids. It sounds so cliched to say that you bring history to life for them, but WOW. Kids who thought they had \"learned\" World War II are going to be knocked off their feet when they read this. Letting readers know what happened to Henry and Patsy after he returned home is nice, but this story goes so far beyond that... for me, it was even more powerful than the first one.\n",

      "\"Under a War-Torn Sky\" has been my favorite book ever since I read it as a child, but I had no idea there was a sequel to it until a couple of months ago when I hastily bought it off of Amazon without research or checking out reviews. To be honest, I've read almost all of L.M. Elliott's books and have loved them all for many different reasons, specifically the amazing historical research and accuracy she writes with, so I had high hopes.\n",
      "This book is like her others: well-written and heavily researched. It helps that Henry Forester is one of my favorite characters (probably one of my earliest Book Boyfriends). I am very emotional after reading the book, just like I was after reading \"Under a War-Torn Sky,\" and pleased with the conclusion of Henry's story. All my favorite characters returned (Patsy, Pierre, and Madame), though not always happily, but it tied off Henry's relationships very well.\n",
      "Overall, I am very happy I read it. I almost feel like that kid who read the first book over and over again, highlighting her favorite passages, and mourned over how beaten up the book became after carrying it all over the place to reread in a spare moment.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This sequel to Under a War-Torn Sky, was not as compelling, but was a satisfying conclusion. Especially interesting was the 17 page Afterword which covered the aftermath of the devastation of WWII in France. Discussion of PTSD.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is the sequel to Under a War-torn Sky which I have taught in the past and am again using with an EFL class with the theme of WWII. The students have appreciated that book in the past, and when ordering it, I saw there was a sequel and decided to check it out. This picks up shortly after the previous one ends, and is a very interesting look at France in the immediate post-war period. Not for the faint of heart, the descriptions of the retributions and revenge are probably nonetheless still toned down. The book offers what I felt was a quite accurate analysis of the in-fighting between the various groups at the end of the war, and how eyes were closed on the misdeeds of collaborators and worse, when it was felt those persons could forward a political position. This also evokes the subject of post-traumatic stress disorder, a theme often overlooked in the case of WWII vets. As some of the students in my current class are quite young, I'm not sure I would use this with them, but might find this of value with an older class.\n",

      "My finest hour to date. Only recently have I had a chance to actually PLAY the game I created 12 years back, and when my friend Bryan started running it, I got a chance to revisit the line and take serious pride in something that, at the time, was just another batch of books for the MAGE series I managed and co-created. SORCERERS CRUSADE, to me, remains the bar I strive to reach or excel.\n",

      "Basic Premise: An RPG rulebook that covers the playing of Mages in the World of Darkness, in the Renaissance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the game of Mage, and this book gives a lot of lore on the world as it used to be, creating the foundations that lead to the modern world. As in all White Wolf books, there is a tremendous amount of well-written background and story in addition to the rules needed to make the game work. Mage is probably the single most creative and ambitious role-playing magic systems I've ever read, and this book takes the game into one of my favorite periods of history.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want something other than D&D or Pathfinder, but still want to use magic, and you've got a very creative table of people, this game may be the thing for you. I highly recommend reading this book and giving it a try.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I've been looking forward to reading this, as this line was Satyros Phil Brucato's baby, and he's very proud of it, and it should tell me a lot about his attitudes towards M20 (I've liked the Mage Revised books by him I've read, though this will be a line that he had nigh complete editorial control over, to my understanding).\n",
      "\n",
      "And right out of the gate, I'm blown away by the fact that there's a map! And better, it has the White Tower, Mistridge and Doissetep on it, answering questions I've been wondering about for years, and making me feel truly stupid. Well, that's part of the point of this, to find all the things I've missed in Mage by coming to it so late (2001 was my first Mage game).\n",
      "\n",
      "The introductory fiction is quite good, and I'll avoid spoilers other than that, like many Mage books, it involves an Awakening, though this one is a bit unusual. The only thing that bothered me was the font, and that's a matter of taste, but it made even the pleasant writing into a chore to read through for me. The intersticed art, however, by Greg and Tim Hildebrandt, was very good and very atmospheric.\n",
      "\n",
      "The introduction itself is everything that I've come to expect from White Wolf over the years. It was appropriately dramatic, grabbed my attention and roughly laid out what else would be in the book, the sections being Magick (setting), Science (character creation) and Faith (rules) which I can't believe were chosen arbitrarily, but rather to highlight specific connotations, and I'm particularly amused by the fact that they ask us to have Faith in the rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "On to Magick, beginning with Chapter 1: The Path of Thorns. It begins with a general overview of the Mage setting: what an Awakening is, Seekings, the Spheres, etc, but all in Renaissance terms, and considerably more god than in the modern books, fitting to the setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chapter goes on to explain the general Mage concepts in character for the Renaissance, talking about Covenants and Crays (Chantries/Constructs and Nodes), Resonance and The Scourge (paradox), tass and companions. The coolest thing, though, which was lacking in Mage Revised, where I learned the game, was a list of \"Major European Crays and Covenants\" both the Council and the Daedaleans! This is great, it's just name, faction that owns it, and location, but that gives such a good picture of what's where and who's where that it seems essential now that it's been presented to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 2: The Mortal World, is a history. It's VERY Eurocentric, being told in character by a European to a European for a game set in Europe. But even so, there are a few nits to pick. For one thing, the world was precisely how large most people thought it was, Columbus was wrong in thinking it smaller, which is why he thought he'd made it to India. Rather, most people thought that the world was empty sea between Europe and Asia via the West. This particular nit is probably redundant, due to the language being likely a bit florid, but it's a personal pet peeve to give Columbus too much credit, so I couldn't help but point it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a bit of ahistorical references inside, though that's clearly for the benefit of the modern reader (there wasn't really a \"Germany\" during the Renaissance, and the word was used often to denote the modern region, which at the time was more accurately the Holy Roman Empire.) A few more nits to pick, because very little is said that is substantially wrong (making this one of the better researched history sections in an RPG book I've seen, though I'm not a Renaissance historian), but the number of people killed by the Inquisition seems high, though I don't know how the historical discussion has changed over time (I can find some references from the early 2000's indicating very low numbers, but the numbers do seem to be in some dispute, and I see numbers ranging from 1800 (Spanish Jews) to 40,000,000 (all of Europe, for almost 700 years) depending on what you include in the Inquisition, which era, and which historians you trust).\n",
      "\n",
      "The mundane history closes on a strong note: a good timeline. It hits a lot of major events, including things that most people wouldn't think about (like the implementation of + and - to denote addition and subtraction) along with all the obvious ones, like the War of the Roses.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then we get to the magical history, a huge part of what makes it a Mage book rather than a Renaissance history text, and they start at the beginning, with the roots of so very many magical traditions, including the Order of Reason, tracing back to ancient Egype vis Thothmes and Hatshepshut. The rest of the history is pretty solid with a detailed timeline, though there are a few unfortunate things, with terms like \"Gypsy\" left in, and I hope that Mage 20 does a better job with such groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 3: I feel like I'm getting a bit long winded, as I'm only just now getting to chapter 3. Now we're into the world of magick, and the part of the setting that makes Mage tick, and finishing off Book I: Magick. Then we get into Faith and Science, which will go much faster, because I'm not going to go into so much detail on reviewing game mechanics (though I'll note anything that jumps out at me) as I will setting and character.\n",
      "\n",
      "This chapter includes a VERY detailed discourse on the Mists, which in the modern line are called the Umbra, and frankly, presents a far more coherent cosmology than Mage Revised does, making clear the various relationships and where different realms live (inasmuch as location makes sense) and what the Horizon actually is: the furthest reaches, where all the realms are carved out by magi. It even makes mention of some of the big ones: Horizon, Doissetep, Fors Collegis Murceris (all Hermetic), Helekar (Euthanatos) and Perseus Sanctum (Skyrigger). It then continues to the Fragmentum, the realms of the Spheres/Planets, and then down to the Underworld. As a curious aside, it's here that I realized that the word \"entropy\" used throughout the book and referring to a sphere, was first used in 1865, combining the English root \"en\" (meaning inside) and the Greek root \"tropos\" meaning change or transformation. Funny that it should be used in a Renaissance book, but I can assume that is for consistency with Mage: the Ascension.\n",
      "\n",
      "When discussing the Void, there's the curious fact that the narrator, a Verbena, speaks casually of having lovers among the Skyriggers, a faction of the Order of Reason, which tells us many things about the War at the time, namely that the sides are more permeable than most mages wish to admit. And now I'm looking at that sentence and wondering when my hobby of historiography started asserting itself into reading about fictional worlds centuries before the games that I actually play take place...I suppose I could just write something like this out as a dissertation or excerpt from something from an in-character historian...\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to Book II: Faith\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 4 is Character, and it starts out as a fairly standard character creation section for a White Wolf book. I've never been a big fan of a strict \"one tool per sphere\" method of assigning foci, preferring instead holistically defined paradigms where how to do each individual effect has to be considered and must flow naturally. But I know that's rather hard (people with a stronger interest in philosophy or investment in a particular paradigm tend to do better with this) so this system is fine as long as it's optional, and it hasn't really gone away. Though previews of M20 indicate that this system is finally being toppled by a game mechanically defined holistic paradigm approach, which I very much approve of.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a nod in the direction of craft names, though throughout the run of the whole game this is something that comes and goes. The rest of the chapter continues to be fairly standard, a few different abilities are mentioned to match the time period, but nothing earth-shattering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 5: the players, is another meaty one. Here we get to factions. The sections on the Ahl-i-Batin and Solificati are very nice, though the other Traditions don't really have much to add compared to their modern selves. This is unsurprising, because their modern selves evolved from these versions, after all. But the real joy of the chapter is in the Order of Reason getting a detailed description. They've changed so much more to the modern setting that this look into their origins is very well placed, describing the early Conventions with precisely the same care that the Traditions got. (Something, to note, which was entirely lacking in Mage: the Ascension Revised)\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 6: The Storyteller, has advice on storytelling. The advice is generally solid, though nothing an experienced ST hasn't figured out on their own by that point. It does, however, have a bit on how magick works, and more importantly, how it feels and how Resonance works.\n",
      "\n",
      "Book III: Science\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 7: Rules, contains the rules. How success and failure work, damage, combat, etc. It also has an extended discussion of the Umbra and spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 8, Magick Rules, is the heart of any Mage core book's mechanics. This is one of the better ones I've seen. It's got a long list of common effects and how to do them with spheres. Including a section titled \"How do you do that?\" which is going to be a title of an upcoming book is great. This section covers Shapechanging, permanent effects, creating wonders, necromancy, otherworldly travel, perception, summoning and warding, charms, possession, exorcism...it's truly excellent. And then it goes into \"Roleplaying the Magician\" another very good section that I recommend for all players. It discusses several paradigms and mystic tools, and then moves on to spells. This is the best magick rules section I've seen, though admittedly, it's only my third one to go through carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we reach the Appendix. This consists of characters and wonders, spirits and machines, along with the mood resources that are usually discussed at the beginning in Revised books. It's notable that Ars Magica is still on the list at this point, before the WoD/ArsM break became complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's it. I think the review speaks for itself, but I'll just sum up with this: the Sorcerer's Crusade is an excellent book, and I'm tempted to try to run a game based on it, I just need players, time, and a bit of a plot to start from. Having read this, I'm looking forward to reaching Mage 2nd Edition, which it's based on, and which is likely to form the bulk of the basis for Mage20, with some Revised elements mixed in.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "“The Great Work.” That’s what I called this book in my youth, 20+ years ago. An absolutely beautiful game, Mage: The Sorcerer’s Crusade captures the spirit of the Renaissance in a game about Magick, Faith, and Science.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I set out to re-read this tome a week ago, I feared that it would lose the beauty and wonder that it originally inspired. Luckily, I was wrong. This is still an amazing game worthy of the title “The Great Work.” I would definitely love to run it again.\n",

It is about love and loss, friendships and broken hearts; it is a literal rite of passage in a small town.\n",

      "What is Panic? That's the question everyone seems to be asking. The book summary says it's a legendary, high stakes game played by graduating seniors in a dead-end town because there's nothing else to do. Those who've read the blurb seem to think it'll be the next Hunger Games. Frankly, I'm just surprised for a well known author as Lauren Oliver and a summary that couldn't be clearer, nobody seems to have a clue, and the people who do know aren't saying. Well, I'm saying, and here's my take: it's a shame nobody has a clue what Panic really is, because to truly enjoy and appreciate Lauren Oliver's newest book, you have to know, really know, what it's about.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is is a gritty contemporary set in dying small town America. It's about a group of teenagers who put their lives on the line, yes because they have nothing better to do, but really because it's the kind of town where everyone wants out but the only ticket any of them can afford is the one they can get only by pooling their money together - and it pays for only one person, of course. It might be hard to imagine, but there really are towns like Carp out there, heck whole cities even *cough* Detroit, and what I really like is how, behind the sob stories and the tearjerker moments of the individual players, Oliver's story captures the hopelessness and desperation of living in these towns, where everyone wants out simply because the truth is there isn't a future left by staying. Is just a dumb game? Maybe. But it's also a golden ticket, an answer to a hopeless situation, a high stakes with life changing repercussions - for the winner the losers - and I like how the dumb game is really a foil for a story that's really about taking that one chance because these are towns that have left their residents broken and with nothing left to lose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even better, Oliver's made sure that that desperation comes through with every one of her characters. I'm not going to lie, these characters are unlikeable, they can be selfish, they can be self-centered, they can be vindictive, but that's also what makes them human. None of them have deep motives or anything, but that's the beauty of this story, they're , they want . In a way, asks a very simple question - what would you do to win sixty grand? - but unlike any other story, Heather, Nat, and the other contestants, they're for the money in a way others aren't, all thanks to this dead-end town of no prospects. And as a cautionary tale, there's Dodge, the only one not in it for the money, the one who knows, even if he doesn't understand, just how badly the greed and the desperation can turn out. It's this backdrop, this broken town of desperate people all needing that one payday because they've convinced themselves it's the one ticket to a future, and not the personal problems of any one character - although they are many, that makes Oliver's story work.\n",

      "Of course, I'm not saying can't be read as teens playing, you know, Panic, the game. Lauren Oliver does a great job writing the challenges that are part of the game, and even if I think the dead-end town feel is what makes the book, I did enjoy the challenges themselves too. I'd like to think of myself as someone who's read just about everything, but who knew she could make stealing guns from a drunk guy suspenseful and exciting? And not to spoil all the challenges, but later on I really liked how she could connect the final few eliminations back to that question I talked about earlier - just how desperate are you to win sixty grand? - so the book really works on two levels, the competition to win the prize as the summary teases but also the story of these towns where a crazy game like Panic can seem like a lifeline. In fact, I really only have two nitpicks - doesn't have the best of starts with the way Heather's character is introduced and her really cliched reasons for initially participating in the game (cheating boyfriend lol) and the ending is kind of a letdown with its forced sense of closure, but otherwise, what a great story about a town of broken people.\n",

      "You must read this book series! From the Mouth of Elijah is a masterful continuation in this remarkable series.

With Bonnie suffering, growing corruption on Earth, Earth trying to wage war on the innocent people of Second Eden, and a Disease that threatens to kill the original Anthrozils, there is never a dull moment. Mount Elijah has erupted and destroyed most of Second Eden leaving many residents of Second Eden dead or injured. Matt quickly puts his healing abilities to good use on some of the wounded victims. Meanwhile Billy and Lauren are on a search for Bonnie, with the help of Lauren's super hearing she is able to follow her mother's song.

      "Paraphrasing Whitehead, I would say that the safest general characterisation of the science-fiction tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to H. G. Wells. Indeed, The War of the Worlds is probably the most influential novel of the whole science fiction genre, as well as a significant part of the horror category. I remember reading this short novel as a child and being viscerally engrossed and terrified. Rereading it now made me aware of a few more things. First, I realised how this book sums up and, in a way, accomplishes some of the things H. G. Wells had experimented with before. To name a few: the Darwinian conflict between two similar species (), the fascination for freakish life forms (), the chase around working-class London and its surrounding area ().\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible that H. G. Wells’s remarkable book was perceived, at the close of the 19th century, as just a catastrophic story — similar to, say, or at the end of the 20th. In hindsight, is much more than that. It is indeed the kernel and the seed of all the later tales of extraterrestrial invasion and tropes of apocalyptic destruction, from H. P. Lovecraft’s to Arthur C. Clarke’s , Robert Heinlein’s , Ray Bradbury’s , Arkady Strugatsky’s , Michael Faber’s , Ted Chiang’s , or Jeff VanderMeer’s … Not to mention films and TV: , , and so many more that I forget as I write this short note.\n",
      "\n",
      "What strikes me the most is that Wells depicts humanity in the shoes of the invaded party and pictures the invaders as an alien race of bloodthirsty molluscs — which, in itself, sounds like a veiled but stark criticism of Western imperialism and sense of superiority. But, as it turns out, Wells’s prophetic vision was not so much that of a War of the Worlds with extraterrestrial invaders, but precisely a vision of the World War between fellow humans, that would break out some twenty years later, with a technological arsenal not unlike that of the Martians (cf. mechanised artillery, chemical warfare, surgical strikes). Later still, when the Second World War began, and the Nazis were about to invade the whole of Europe, Orson Welles remembered this old tale about a Martian invasion. He turned it into an incredibly relevant radio sensation. The masses of refugees, described by H. G. Wells, fleeing the war in a disorderly and life-threatening manner is a sight anyone may witness even today, despite all the concrete walls or steel fences that are supposed to stop them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, this is an unavoidable masterpiece. The only reproach I could make is regarding the ending. The deadly flu epidemic the Martians eventually suffer from feels a bit like a disappointing . As a side note: historically, things unfolded the other way around when Spanish Conquistadors landed on the shores of the New World. They didn’t win against the Aztec and Inca Empires so much because of the superiority of their weapons, religion or culture, but because they were bringing the smallpox virus along with them — the first major and unwitting case of biological warfare.\n",
      "\n",
      ": Wells’s novel has been brought to the screen a significant number of times, one of the most recent ones being Steven Spielberg’s adaptation (2005) with Tom Cruise. The film takes a few liberties with the book, setting the story in present-day Connecticut. However, one very clever unfaithfulness is that the aliens do not come from Mars but from underground (a nod to , no doubt). Spielberg isn’t new to the alien-first-contact genre. But this is an outright nightmarish and nail-biting take on what had once been a benevolent musical spaceship or a heart-warming horticultural E.T. longing for home — in this film, aliens also play the trombone and are versed in landscaping. Still, they spray their gardens with human blood. Spielberg’s comes after the intense and graphic scenes of the Omaha Beach assault in and is roughly in the same vein. Some scenes, like the innumerable bodies, suddenly floating down a glistening river, or the empty cloths raining from a blazing sky, are strangely beautiful and horrifying. In the midst of the gruesome devastation, Tom Cruise, Tim Robbins and Dakota Fanning are exceptional, playing the parts of regular people, suddenly overwhelmed with PTSD and facing the brutal ending of all things.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Written in 1897, The War of the Worlds is one of the earliest stories about mankind and aliens. Many consider this book to be the inception of the science fiction genre.\n",
      "\n",
      "This story is relatively straightforward: An unknown man is going about his life in jolly old England when aliens invade, causing chaos and destruction. How will this story end? Will humans overcome the aliens or will they all be captured, killed, or enslaved?\n",
      "\n",
      "The War of the Worlds starts off smashingly. HG Wells doesn’t need a 100-page warm up. The action starts flowing from the start. Also, there are some very humorous bits. It is quite easy to see how with the humor amplified, this could turn into The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The War of the Worlds seems so realistic in many ways. In fact, on October 30, 1938, there was a radio broadcast that adapted The War of the Worlds, changing the invasion point from England to New Jersey. People who listened on the radio actually thought that it was real!\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the story started strongly, I became bored around the halfway point. Some of the sentences and paragraphs were way too long. We can only store so many words in our short-term memory. If you write an extremely long sentence, people will forget the beginning by the time they reach the end. Modern guidance suggests 15-20 words per sentence. It appears based on my Google Search, that around the time of Wells the average sentence averaged 20-30 words. However, Wells has sentences which are greater than 100 words!\n",
      "\n",
      "This style of writing is difficult to read, and I appreciate how literature has evolved (Philip Pullman, Neil Gaiman, Blake Crouch).\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Wells gets a little too far off the path with the copious descriptions of the aliens: the organs and the clothing. As Philip Pullman warns, the author must not leave the path. “The reason for this is simple: if you leave the path, the readers put down the book.” With this, I wholeheartedly agree (especially combined with the massive paragraphs).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I admire HG Wells for his inspiration into future works of science fiction. Of course, the Flesch Reading Ease score had not yet been developed at the time that Wells authored The War of The Worlds.\n",

      "The War of the Worlds goes beyond the of-the-time popular military invasion fiction, which took away the standard protagonist/antagonist arc of single characters and popped whole countries or tribes in their place, and brings down to Earth a whole new enemy at a time when science fiction did not exist and science itself was oft thought of as fiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Surrey, a professor is caught up in the invasion of Martians as they sweep through London and its surrounding boroughs after witnessing several explosion on the planet Mars at the Ottershaw observatory. We follow the un-named professor and his brother in first-person narrative, seeing through their eyes this invasion and the destruction caused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing one needs to reference is the radio adaptation of 1938, which was narrated by Orson Welles and caused panic due to its news-bulletin style: those listening thought it was the truth. Whilst reading the novel, there is no doubt that the imagery, style and prose of H.G. Wells purported this panic. It is written with such imagination that it's difficult not to imagine oneself standing on the side of a crater as Martians crawl sluggishly out of their spaceships.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not often that I can forgive a book its downfalls due to the time of its writing. (It's all very well to accept that, for the most part, racism and sexism and things of that ilk were at many times in history acceptable behaviour, but enjoying a book from a period with those things in this day and age is a thing I find difficult to do.) However, in the case of I think it is vitally important to read the book with the exact time and place it was written in history to be lodged within your mind alongside every word you read.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a primitive form of speculative fiction, the very foundations of what we now call science fiction. At the time, H.G. Wells was writing fiction that had scientific and imaginative leanings, but no-one would think that perhaps the fiction was not quite fiction after all. There is little mention of the Martians weaponry or technology except when it is in use: any modern-day writer of sci-fi would absolutely be telling you all about the nuts and bolts of the piece. We have primitive science, because that is what they had at the time of writing. Whilst the future may have been thought of, the idea of futuristic technology was as alien to them as the Martians and their technology are in the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the excitement of the scientific exploration of futures is not to be found here. But the imagination of Wells is so beyond almost everything else that was around at the time and coupling it with popular militarist fiction means that this is an extremely important novel in the progression of English fiction. It is not surprising that Wells was, like Darwin himself, stuck inextricably between the truth of science and the tradition of religion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story itself, if put in perspective-removed from its time period and thought of solely as a novel-is nothing special. The narrator is disjointed with his surroundings, the story disappointing in the way it ends and less dramatic and climactic than it could have been. The style of prose is lacking, the dialogue just standard and the characters just slight breezes on a warm day. In that, it would require a mere two or three stars: enjoyable, if a little boring.\n",
      "\n",
      "The imagination of a scientific man who is at odds with what is right and wrong. The spectacular birth of a new genre of, not only writing, but of thinking, too. The fact that even though my oestrogen levels were almost at zero, the reunion at the end made me cry my eyes out because it was written so perfectly, so unexpectedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, that film with that actor was better. Of course it was. We have perspective and technology now that means the original is pretty pathetic. It cannot possibly compete with our high standards of today, unless you have half a brain and take this novel for what it truly represents. Unless.\n",

      "Two great series of Aliens and Battling Starships!\n",
      "\n",
      "These books are fast-paced, action-packed, suspenseful with romance. Michael Wallace describes his characters and plots very thoroughly and in great detail, and he keeps your attention to see what will happen next. These books are so hard to put down. I love the main characters and following them on their escapades. If you like science fiction, you will definitely like these books. I love them and look forward to more. Happy reading!\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Starship Blackbeard – Starship Blackbeard #1 - This is a brilliant series, the author has basically taken the entire concept of the old Colonial sailing days on the high seas, and the Royal Navy protecting the Colonies for the King from Pirates etc, and put it in space.\n",
      "Captain James Drake of the Starship Ajax, has been wrongly accused of crimes, and as a result, lost his command, his ship, his commission, and is off to a penal colony to do hard labour. His loyal crew, however, has other ideas and mutinies to rescue him.\n",
      "What follows is what can only be described as, a swashbuckling tale of high adventure of the very best sort.\n",
      "This story seriously has everything you could want. Not only are there exceptionally good Characters, the Captain is brilliant, Drake is of Noble birth (as all good Captain's should be!), and has a very fine crew. However, due to the circumstances he finds himself in, he soon has to engage, and even hire Pirates as part of his crew, just to survive.\n",
      "This leads to some rather amusing exchanges between the crew.\n",
      "The ships, although they are starships, have ‘cannons’ and other equivalent gun emplacements similar to that found on the old sea faring vessels. This makes for some brilliant combat sequences as the ships launch into each other like the days of old. The only thing missing are the sails!\n",
      "The story is not just about the Captain and the ships mutiny however. The larger story is about a race called the Hroom, a race that have been enslaved as they are addicted to white sugar, in its pure form. Once a Hroom eats it, they become addicted for life, and are hence known as 'eaters'.\n",
      "The Captains Pilot and Navigator, a Hroom called Nyb Pym, has become an eater, and must be rescued, as the Captain believes as a part of the treachery that was played on him, caused the fall of his friend.\n",
      "Starship Blackbeard is a fantastic first book to the series, setting up the story, the background, and all the characters. For those that remember back that far, the characters really remind me of the old Errol Flynn style of movies, where the Captain is a man of honour and noble breeding, and the villains are all corrupt, evil and have no honour at all, the word ‘Dastardly’ just fits perfectly. The Heroes and Heroines are swashbuckling heroes in the truest sense, full of courage and self-sacrificing to the core. There is even the friend who is with the Villain, but he is of noble breeding as well.\n",
      "This is the start of what is going to be a truly brilliant series, and if you are a Sci-Fi fan, love a good read with outstanding characters, a bit of humour, some awesome technology and combat, and an exceptional storyline, then get into this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lords of Space – Starship Blackbeard #2 - - In the 2nd evolution of this series, Captain Drake and Commander Tolvern are still on the run.\n",
      "However they are making their way to Admiral Malthorne’s estate to gather evidence to try and gain a pardon for Drake and his crew. Having defeated the Pirate Vargus, they now encounter his Daughter, Catarina.\n",
      "What starts out as a plan to free Drake and his crew soon turns into a mission to gain an item that could free the Hroom of their addiction to the sugar forever, but as Drake risks his life to get this, he realises that it may be very costly indeed, for if the Hroom are freed of their addiction, they may come after those that caused the addiction in the first place. And the Hroom outnumber Humanity immensely.\n",
      "This series is exceptionally brilliant. Not only does it have the allure of starships fitted out like old fashioned naval ships, with cannons etc, but those that command the ships are also just like the aristocratic elite that once commanded the high seas also. Only those of the highest breeding are allowed to follow the path of command, and thus Drake (and his friend Rutherford), are of Noble birth.\n",
      "Add to this that there are Pirate ships, full with Pirates that would sell their grandmother for a bit more loot and the chance at some booze. The combat scenes are beautifully detailed, with ships of war exchanging weapons like the battles of old, before they latch onto each other with harpoons and board one another with armed boarding parties.\n",
      "It is just like a swashbuckling navy/pirate adventure, but in Space!!\n",
      "Add to this the incredible political and strategic conflict that is also occurring that is going to destabilise the entire sector, and destroy entire systems, possibly all of humanity if the Hroom have their way.\n",
      "In amongst all of this, there are the personal stories of the actual characters as well, Drake, Tolvern, Capp and Carvalho, who were added in as Pirate crew when the Ajax first mutinied and needed help, and became the ‘Blackbeard’. There is also the story of the other Pirates, such as the Vargus clan, and the relationship forming between the Captain and Catarina, much to Tolvern’s horror.\n",
      "If you love your Mil Sci-fi, or just any Sci-Fi, then this is definitely for you, this is a must read for anyone who likes the genre, loves a good read with brilliant characters and a swashbuckling storyline!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dreadnaught – Starship Blackbeard #3 - Blackbeard and her crew have the cure for the sugar eaters, but they are now enemy number one. Malthorne has started all out war with the Hroom Empire, so that he can set in motion events to gain more power for himself.\n",
      "Drakes former best friend Rutherford has been sent to capture or kill Drake and end his Rebellion, but as he is chasing down Drake, he is attacked by a strange ship of unknown origin. In desperate need of help, he calls for aid, and Drake answers this call, and together, they defeat this threat. They discover that this threat is known as ‘The Apex’, and that they have been ravaging the Hroom Empire for some time.\n",
      "It now appears that the galaxy is in turmoil, with humanity at odds between Drake and Malthorne, and now learning of the Hroom and the Apex.\n",
      "In the meantime, Drake meets with a General of the Hroom and gives him the cure for the sugar addiction that is destroying the Hroom, unknown if he will use it.\n",
      "All of this uncovers an another enemy, a Hroom Death Cult, set on destroying Albion at any cost, even at the loss of their own ships and lives. They have a fleet, and multiple heavy weapons and are aimed straight at Albion to destroy humanity once and for all.\n",
      "This leads to a thrilling series of events, Dreadnought is just a fantastic read. The continued portrayal of everything in the old style as very ‘Formal’ British Officers of the Royal Navy with all the cannons and weaponry, as well as the Elite nature of the aristocracy. It makes for a really fascinating and fun read, the dialogue between Drake and the Pirates is very humorous. Malthorne makes a great baddy in his complete drive to just destroy Drake, and cause what appears to be war.\n",
      "Whilst this is a fantastic book, my only complaint would be that it does lack a little depth with some of the back story for some of the characters. The actual characters are really good, but we know little about their actual back stories, such as why Malthorne has it in so desperately for Drake, the relationship between Rutherford and Drake is not really explained that well. They are long time friends, but Rutherford is at different times trying to kill Drake, plotting to help him, secretly working with him, at other times working with Malthorne’s fleet, but as a double agent for Drake, but none of it is ever really explained.\n",
      "We know that Drake has a family, but we never learn anything about them, even though they seem to be such a driving motivation for a lot of his actions. The same goes for Nyb Pim, Drakes pilot, he has a background with Drake, but we have no idea why? And the Hroom overall – there has been this long standing history and war, but there is very little detail about this either.\n",
      "Again, these are fairly minor points, it depends on how much depth you want to go into, because at the end of the day, the actual story itself is wonderfully well written, the battles are exceptionally well described, and this is what all good books should be – a lot of fun.\n",
      "This is well worth the read – it just keeps getting better and better as more of the story unfolds around the Hroom, and the Apex. Can’t wait for Book 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rebellion of the Stars – Starship Blackbeard #4 - This is the story in which the Drake and his crew must face off against Malthorne, who has now seized complete control of Albion, anyone who doesn’t stand with him is either labelled a traitor and jailed, or is executed.\n",
      "With most of the fleet, and the fearsome Dreadnought, Malthorne is not just an idol threat, and with his ragtag fleet of pirates and misfits, Drake could be well out of his league this time around.\n",
      "Rebellion was a fascinating read, although there were the standard ship battles, there was a lot of other types of combat, as Drake sets about destroying Malthorne’s other interest’s to try and weaken him, as well as use a lot of strategic and tactical manoeuvres, making for some really interesting sub-plots.\n",
      "This is a book about the Rebellion as such, about bringing down Malthorne, and without the sheer firepower to do so straight up, Drake has to do it with strategy and cunning. As such, there are a lot of interesting little battles, ground battles reminiscent of the Rebel Alliance tactics in Star Wars type battles. Drake is also trying to get the cure to the Hroom, those that are willing to take it.\n",
      "In the middle of all of this, there is the threat of the Apex looming, and Drake has realised that if Humanity is divided as it currently is, they will be devoured by this new threat. Worse, if they do not help the Hroom, the Hroom could well be destroyed, making the Apex even more powerful.\n",
      "There is a lot of political and fascinating reading in this story, however, some things were still lacking a bit.\n",
      "Again, there was not a lot about the Hroom Empire, their past, just any real background to sort of flesh them out a bit, which would have been nice. After 4 books, Tolvern and Drake are still making silly eyes at each other and acting like love sick teenagers, but nothing ever happens, and it is getting a bit annoying now as far as character development goes, and what happened to Vargas and her brave new world? She has just disappeared! This has been one of the only minor downfalls of this story series, the character development has not been wonderful, and the story would have been even better if there had been some decent character growth along the way.\n",
      "Having said that, there is a good amount of story development with the actual arc, just not those involved. The space battles, and the fighting on the ground has been exceptional and is beautifully described, immersing you into the story.\n",
      "Overall – this has been a great read, just a few minor hiccups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentinel – Sentinel Trilogy #1 - The second trilogy in the series starts off on a space station with a crew discussing the Apex. They are in complete hiding, and have been hiding for some time. The crew stations crew have split into factions during this time. Those that want to remain hidden, and those that want to try and contact the outside world. Of course their mission is to hide and protect the area unless they find Apex, and then destroy them, as they are protecting this particular quadrant of space.\n",
      "You wonder if you have the right book for a while as there is no mention of our heroic crew or the Blackbeard or anything else for some time, until eventually, Jess Tolvern and Blackbeard are back, of course heavily damaged and on the run from Apex, because when is Jess not in a heavily damaged ship.\n",
      "This series is set some time after the events of the first series, the Hroom Empire is still trying to pull itself together from sugar addiction, even though they have the cure, not everyone wants it. They also have Apex running through their territory destroying them at every opportunity. Humanity has come together under a new King, with Drake as the military leader aboard Dreadnaught, and as mentioned, Jess is Captain of the Blackbeard, with Capp, Carvolo, Nyb Pym and the rest of the main characters.\n",
      "Whilst there is a sort of peace between the Hroom and the Humans, the threat now is Apex, this predatory Bird like species that hunts its prey and then kills them in very gruesome and graphic ways, generally whilst they are still living. If you are a bit squeamish, there are parts of this book that you are not going to want to read.\n",
      "This was a real step up for Wallace, the next evolution in the series, in which we went from simple human vs human vs Hroom battles and nothing to grisly about it, to now Apex who like to ritualistically capture, cut up and eat their captives (the higher ranked the better as more power is obtained (they believe).\n",
      "Wallace has created this rather incredible species with a deeply involved background. The only disappointing thing is that we end up learning a lot more about Apex than we do about the Hroom, even after 5 books, we still have not really learnt a huge amount them, their culture etc. It would have been interesting to have this developed a little more.\n",
      "The story focusses a lot on the new Sentinel Station crew, and as stated earlier, the various factions that have developed during their extended isolation, and the resultant power plays that are occurring as a result. The discussion of the Sentinel crew and their original mission is rather interesting as it provides some rather interesting background into what happened when humanity originally left Earth.\n",
      "The Second trilogy has moved more away from Pirates, and regaining respect and lost careers, and has moved towards bloodthirsty Avian’s that are hell bent on conquering the galaxy at any cost, you will certainly have a much healthier respect for larger birds after reading this series!.\n",
      "This is a great first book in the next Trilogy following on from the Blackbeard series.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dragon Quadrant – Sentinel Trilogy #2 - This is the next continuation in the series as Drake and his forces continue their battle against the Apex.\n",
      "The Apex are this bird like species, and trust me, after you read some of the stuff that they do to people, you will never look at birds the same way again. They are a truly evil race. The Apex are ‘Apex Predators’, who take particular pleasure in not just hunting their prey, but then capturing their prey so that they eat them in the most gruesome way possible, piece by slow little piece. This is probably a good time to warn some people that this book is not for those who are a bit squeamish.\n",
      "However, there are several things that do happen within this book. The war with the Apex begins to heat up, it is like a complex chess game, with Tolvern and the Blackbeard being like a Knight, and the Hroom are a combination of Pawns and Rooks/Castles depending on which ships they are. Although Drake is obviously the Queen for the Albion forces, with the power of Dreadnaught, he is not around to help, still coming (or so Tolvern hopes). Added to this, the Albion side have almost a 2nd Queen in the Sentinel station, like a converted Pawn. With the secret weapon within its hull, the Apex have no idea what might hit them.\n",
      "However, as the chess pieces move about, it is like they are being controlled by 3 or 4 separate players who haven’t played the game before.\n",
      "On the other side, the Apex know exactly what they are doing, and move to take both the Station, the Hroom fleets, and Blackbeard.\n",
      "Dragon Quadrant is a book that is full of dramatic little battles, and the moving of all the pieces into place for the final showdown in the final book. However, whilst it does mean that you have to read the 3rd book for the obvious conclusion, this book provides some good insight into the Hroom (finally), the fate of the Singaporean Empire, how they split from the original empire all that time ago and what became of them, and even more fascinating, it gives a very good insight into the hierarchy and structure, even some of the culture of the Apex.\n",
      "Wallace has done an incredible job of bringing to life this alien race that is a violent, predatorial species with that seeks to be the greatest apex predator in the galaxy, and has set about not just conquering any other species they have met, but annihilating them, devouring the bodies of their victims, and salvaging what the fleet needs to move on to its next conquest. They have multiple ship classes for just this use, from smaller craft, right up to enormous ‘harvester’ class vessels that are used to scour every living being off the planet.\n",
      "This is a really good book, a brutal look at how hard war is, the true struggle that each of the crew has to face to survive against an unforgiving and relentless enemy that will stop at nothing.\n",
      "The character work is very clever again, especially that about those that have worked on the Sentinel station for too long, have become set in their ways, as people would.\n",
      "It is incredibly realistic, making this a very good read, adding a level of depth to it.\n",
      "This was a brilliant sequel not just to this series, but to the overall series, and is a must read. It sets up the final for Shattered Sun beautifully, making this an outstanding set of books.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shattered Sun – Sentinel Trilogy #3 - So after all the battles and engagements, the liaisons with the Singaporeans, and the treaties with the Hroom, this has all lead to this final book. The Hroom have come to support Tolvern, but she is left hanging at her moment of need by McGovern, and decides that the need of Sentinel 3 is too great, taking the Hroom and Blackbeard to assist them. Unbeknownst to her, there are games afoot in the Hroom fleet, and Mose Drys is no longer in command of his fleet. Further to this, Admiral Drake and Dreadnaught are a long way off before they can support them.\n",
      "What follows are several chapters of incredible story telling as Humans, both Albion and Singaporean and Hroom, fight for their very existence against the unrelenting and devastating forces of the Apex. The Apex are there only to destroy, to collect bodies for their sacrifices and to feed upon, the more and the higher ranked the better.\n",
      "This is a book of grim determination, against horrifying odds, knowing that to lose, is to not just potentially have your ship destroyed, to die, but to possibly be slowly eviscerated and eaten, and watch those you care and love also be eaten as you watch. The Apex are unforgiving, don’t surrender, don’t stop, and seem to have more ships than should be possible.\n",
      "However, as Wallace builds this story to its climatic end, he plays on the one thing that Apex does not have, the resolve to survive that is buried deep within each of the Humans and Hroom alike. The courage to face up to this enemy together against insurmountable odds. Wallace does an exceptional job of building this story, not just from this book, but from the previous two books as well.\n",
      "We also get the fun of seeing a Star Leviathan unleashed in this book (sorry minor spoiler, but I won’t say anymore), and it was incredible the descriptions of this amazing star creature in all its glory. Wallace had previously described the creature, but we had not seen one in full swing until now.\n",
      "As with the other stories, he has continued to grow the characters (maybe not as much as some other Sci-Fi Space Operas), allowing us to engage and become attached to each of the main characters.\n",
      "There are still several unanswered questions however, so I do expect that we will see another series (a certain Pirate Captain has still not turned up, nor has her secret system, and there are other things not finalised)\n",
      "Overall, this is a great end to this trilogy, with some spectacular and outstanding starship combat, as well as some closure to some aspects of the story. This is exactly what this type of book is meant to be about, swashbuckling fun, with a bit of seriousness, good characters, and some stunning combat, both in space and hand-to-hand.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Where to start\n",
      "\n",
      "First let me preface this review by stating that this is an entertaining series. Too bad it had to be written by an unimaginative,or possibly an over imaginative, writer. I know that statement is contradictory but don’t have other words to describe him. While I wholeheartedly agree with using old Earth, wet-navy nomenclature to describe space navies, there has to be a line. I mean, maybe the writer is indulging in literary license, but for Christ’s sake. Space barnacles? Give me a break. Then combine that with War Sloops, a spaceship with a quarterdeck,harpooning other ships, an away pod that is slung shot t orwards another ship and caught with an arm holding a net. Good gosh. What is this dude thinking? It is an amazing story brought down by the writer’s weird use of ignorant terms for naval nomenclature. Worth the read if you’re willing to overlook the downright ignorance of the writer. Never did call him an author. Wonder why.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "An excellent sci-fi read. I had read most of these book individually but it was great to have them all in one continuous package. The cast of characters is good as is the technology described. OK, the theory of naval broadsides of solid shot is a bit quirky - as another author once put it \" the problems facing a starship captain wanting to engage in battle are the speeds of the vessels and the distances involved\" - a solid shot broadside would require both vessels to be in very close proximity and moving at relatively slow speeds by any standard. However - the concept of carrying extra crew in stasis and the problems after carrying out a warp jump make up for this. I would recommend this collection of stories to anyone with a love of military Sci-Fi.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Military Action Like You Don't Find Any More\n",
      "\n",
      "Pirate ships at sea, airplane dogfight, WWI and WWII Naval battles, they are all here but now in space. It's exciting, it's fun, I couldn't put it down! I suppose if I had to make any negative criticism at all it would be the distances in space are not realistic, even with the \"wormhole\" transit points. But there is a lot of original stuff even with unknown wormhole destinations and giant monsters that eat space ships. I especially liked the whole bird society. It COULD even be based on real birds, I don't know. But it SOUNDS real. Thank you Mr. Wallace for some great entertainment.\n",

      "I thought the stories in this book were great, and really, really entertaining. But, when I bought it, I had hoped it would be more about places I could actually visit. Unfortunately, it was mostly ghost stories and myths that didn't seem to come from very credible sources. (By this I mean they seemed like random accounts from one or two people, not well known legends.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I did enjoy the book, though, and I am glad I have it. I was especially excited to see Magic Forest and The House of Frankenstein Wax Museum up in Lake George in the book, two places I visit almost every trip up there.\n",

      "I recommend this book to everyone who loves fun stories and myths, but not for the actual travel suggestions.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "This is probably the best \"Weird\" book in the series next to Weird New Jersey. The book is filled with interesting stories, folklore, people, and places that weren't repeats. After reading several different \"Weird\" books, it is easy to start to notice repeating stories, or folklore that sounds like something from anywhere in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only problems I have with the book is that the last chapter on Abandoned Buildings could of been named \"Old Mental Hospitals\" seeing how 80% of the chapter was about some sort of hospital. Also the chapter on the Jackson Whites was practically identical to the Weird New Jersey book. Since the Jackson Whites are unique to New Jersey and New York, the story repeat wasn't annoying, but it is the fact that they didn't change much of the text that turned me off. Finally, the book is based mostly out of New York City and Long Island. I didn't mind it personally, but anyone from upper state New York might want to keep that in mind when picking up the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that I have a list of places to check out whenever I go to New York state, which generally means the book is successful.\n",

      "My husband got me this book for my birthday...and it was very good. I enjoy the weird roadside attractions you find as you travel from town to town and this book is full of them. Most of the stories of course are in New York city....but i was able to find three that are fairly close by. Most of the stories are about haunted or creepy places...and I was hoping for more of the weird attractions like worlds biggest ball of yarn and things. Well written also includes small first hand accounts by locals. If you are headed to New York city definately get this book to try some of the things and visit some of the places. I would recommend this book....I am also going to get the Weird US. book by the same group.\n",

There were times I was a little stressed about what was going on between them, and a little frustrated with Ember- but seeing all she’d been through I understood her. I completely adored Josh though. He was fantastic. When you start this book, make sure you have a few tissues handy. The first few chapters had me in tears. It’s an emotional read, but it’s also sweet, sexy and has moments that will put a smile on your face! I can’t wait to read more of these books. Especially Jagger's story!\n",

The author wrote in such a way that I was completely in the head of the heroine and feeling it, it was perfect. The author wrote from deep within herself, drawing on her own emotions and possibilities, that's why it translates so authentically to the page. I was mesmerized throughout the book. Tears came to me at the beginning and I sobbed at the end, it took my breath away. Any story that moves me in this way has to be a 5 star read. Stunning and seriously sexy…. Wowza….

Ohhh, she was such a pain in the as*!\n",

      "This was a very good ending. If I'm being completely honest the last book of the Night Huntress series was a bit lacking, a very themed book that seemed like it needed to be more of a novella than anything else. But Up From the Grave delivers and manages to clean up whatever sour taste One Grave at a Time left behind. Full of shocking developments, and the humorous dialogue we have come to expect and love, Up from the Grave is the ending The Night Huntress series deserved.\n",

      "Cat and Bones are still the steamiest couple in the block. In this novel you pretty much got to see every important character in the series again, every single one made an appearance. Except for the dead ones that is. It was nice that Jeaniene gave us some closure in that aspect, the book definitely felt like it was saying goodbye.\n",

They know the new boss that heads up Cat's old dept with homeland security, Madigan, is behind it.

Just sayin'. He is so supportive of Cat. Always having her back and protecting her. I have said it before and I will say it again Bones is perfect! Cat is still awesome, lovable, kick-ass, sassy Cat, but she is a little more mature in this book. I love seeing her growth, but I love that she is still Cat. Cat is fiercely loyal, she has a good heart, and will die to protect those she loves. Cat and Bones have one of the best relationships I have ever read.

I enjoyed the hell out of the ass kicking her and Bones passed around to Madigan's men. I think that Madigan got off way to easy. I would have liked to have seen a little torture maybe, and a way worse death. I know bloodthirsty right? When I found out that Cat has a daughter, I freaked, damn I so didn't see that coming. I loved Ian in this book. He also gets better with every book and I can't wait until his book comes out. I can't wait to hear his back story and the woman awesome enough to win his heart! This book was an awesome end to one of my favorite series, but it's not the end of the night huntress world. There will be more Vlad and Ian, and I hope we get to see Katie grown up. Really if you haven't check this series out already, don't take my word on how epic it is, read it and experience the awesomeness for yourself.\n",

      "I am such a spy junkie! I love this author so much!!! This is definitely one of my two favorite spy series.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really gained insight into how some of the biggest criminal masterminds work. The way James and Bruce infiltrated the Mad Dogs was flawless and obviously well-planned. I couldn't put this book down once I started to read it. All of the pieces fit together and I wasn't able to find any plot holes whatsoever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writing. Muchamore's writing is impeccable. He described everything without making anything seem boring. Each detail was important.\n",
      "\n",
      "The research. The moment that I was pulled into the gang conflict, I could tell that Muchamore certainly did his research. I learned about different models of guns and drugs and how the British underworld revolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The action and suspense all through out the books kept me on edge. It made me think of all the possible scenarios that Muchamore was going to throw at me. The re-readability level of this book is off the hook. I read it three times and I never got tired of it. Every time I read it, I got caught up in all of the gun shootings, pursuits, and missions. It's just THAT good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Muchamore's style is one-of-a-kind and so is the originality and cleverness of the plot. You never know what's going to happen. It's going to leave you asking for more. A definite A+.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "One of the best Cherub books by far, packing exhilarating action scenes, the troubles of growing up, infiltrating a gang, being involved in a British gang war. After reading the whole Cherub series 6 times not only myself but my friends who have also read the Cherub series, have easily come to the conclusion that Mad Dogs was the book that made James legendary in the sense that the book changed our vision of him from a misbehaving teenager who caught a lucky break on some missions to a serious and mature teenager who shines on missions. If I were to recommend this book to anybody, I wouldn't be recommending the book, I would say that you need to read this series in order. As that way you can fully understand the Cherub universe.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "At this point in the series Muchamore is confident in his new formula. While most early Cherub books concentrated only on the mission (except for book 1, which had the recruiting and training part), nowadays we get a mixture of the mission and the agent's life at the campus. It works well, because the characters are well-drawn and it's always entertaining to follow their lives, and the missions are always intense and dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "In mad dogs, James and Bruce have to infiltrate a violent gang. There's a gang war going on and another Cherub agent has been very seriously injured after being stabbed twice. It was good to see James go back to an identity he used in an earlier mission, and renew his acquaintance with Junior Moore, from book 2. It was also nice to see Bruce in action. Bruce is probably the best martial artist among James' friends, but he has not had many opportunities to shine so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book, like all in the series, is well researched and quite realist in its treatment of gang violence.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "After Gabrielle O'Brian gets stabbed in the back by a member of The Runts, a gang, while on a mission, Michael Hendry only wants to get revenge. But when the Ethics Committee turns down the request for him to go back to finish the mission, Michael then requests James Adams and Kyle Blueman finish the job for them. So, after days of pleading and begging, the Ethics Committee finally agrees. Then, following a horrifying attack in a school yard, James is arrested. Did James and Kyle end up getting revenge? Mad Dogs is about friends, perseverance, and revenge.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Mad Dogs covers the issue of British gangs and the intimidating threat of criminal activity that poses a threat to civilian safety. The story heavily focuses on status of street gangs and their ideology including power, territory and organised crime (specifically drug dealing in this case).This book was written in 2007 where gang crimes were notorious and a huge problem for the British Police force and government. Our main character, James Adams is now 16 and now that James is becoming older, the tones of the book have become slightly more gritty and the criminals have become more violent which fits in well with the theme of this book. The book does dive into human nature on survival as there are times where the best option is sometimes to fight back.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is James’s 8th mission and its objective was to intercept a turf war between two major gangs in England, ‘The Slasher Boys’ and ‘The Runts’ . The story line follows after the end of Class A where Keith Moore’s gang has collapsed with the two gangs engaged in a violent conflict over the Luton underworld. Cherub’s plan is to sneak James into a football club controlled by the Mad Dogs and endeavouring to use his connections with Keith Moore to get close to Sasha, the leader of the gang. James throughout the plot shows his loyalty through raids and stealing and eventually gains the Boss’ trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chapters that engrossed me the most were about the Cherubs Gabrielle O’Brien and Michael Hendry which kick started the over arching problem of the book. I found it the most thrilling part and the action kept me on edge as it developed the most tension to the story. However, afterwards I personally feel the 8th book in the CHERUB series has (unfortunately) falling short for me. The pacing felt like it dragged from specific sections in the story which diminished part of my experience. Despite the story was lacking to my taste, I didn’t hate the book and I still continue to enjoy the real world issues that Muchamore writes about in fictional way.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this book I believe it did a greater job in exploring it’s secondary characters than our main protagonists. Although, this may be due to the case that our beloved main agents are maturing and that the author wants to investigate new attributes behind different characters. Muchamore has proven that he has a good understanding of the main figures' personalities very well. I especially like the sections concentrated upon Bruce and the antagonists such as Wheels and Junior. Including Junior, there were returning personas from one of my favourite books from Muchamore’s collection: Class A, which adds to the sense of nostalgia which I thrive upon. Through growing to love these characters and the progression of missions, this book ends the story of one of the older generations, Kyle who was the person who first recruited James to CHERUB. This was sad to see as I loved Kyle’s sassy nature yet maturity on how he acted liked an older brother to James. Nevertheless, James’ maturity level has notably changed and has become a minor, but significant pivotal moment in the series, where James interaction with his current girlfriend, Diana has become more honest and knowledgeable to admit to his mistakes unlike his past romantic relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, Muchamore has sculptured and developed both the main and secondary characters well in the 8th novel of CHERUB, encapsulating the various character’s motives and personalities. In spite of this, I felt the plot did slow down at points as it lingered to evolve to the main point reducing my enjoyment, but it did try to redeem itself with fast pace action.\n",
      "\n",
      "My Rating: 3\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the whole mysterious story was well written for a mixed variety of genres. This' book target audience is for teens mainly boys, but I believe this can be enjoyed by female teenagers as well. I would definitely recommended the whole series.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a book you can lost in and let hours pass and is the series that started me to read again. TRULY RECOMMEND.\n",

      "This isn’t really the kind of book you’d sit and read cover to cover. Like, I did, but I’m not really a role model for how people should live their lives. I loved it, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "What For Keeps is, is a collection of essays written for magazines (largely the New Yorker, but elsewhere too), generally reviewing then-current films. They were written back before screeners and largely before VHS/Beta allowed people to take movies into their homes, so a lot of her reviews try to capture her emotions after a screening or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, when I read a collection of this sheer size and scope – it’s well over a thousand pages and over an inch thick – I find the essays all kind of bleed into each other and it’s hard to pick moments out of the pack. Fortunately, it’s not the case here. Although there are plenty of reviews for movies I’ve never seen (and probably never will), her prose, insight and instincts generally stand out well after I’ve read them. For example, when she writes about “Last Tango in Paris,” she carves into the raw sexuality of Brando. Elsewhere, she gets into the madness of Nicolas Cage, the way Paul Newman can make his characters appealing and looks at what made Cary Grant so good at what he did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, taking her essays all in order lets you see how her judgment evolved, changed and focused over the years. For example, when she rips into “Full Metal Jacket,” it isn’t just a broadside against the movie, but a part of a long-running antagonistic relationship with Kubrick, who she feels lost himself when he moved to England and started taking himself too seriously. Or her long-running dislike for Clint Eastwood, where her arguments about violence in movies – particularly in how it rationalizes the violence viewers are supposed to embrace – sound as fresh as anything you’d read on AV Club, Grantland or New Yorker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, there are moments which sound dated. Kael is probably best remembered for her insight or wit, but she also had a real nasty streak. When I read her calling someone a fatty, I wonder what’d she say about Melissa McCarthy. And her defence of a movie like “Driving Miss Daisy” seems a little reactionary, particularly since I’d read Roxane Gay’s almost in tandem with For Keeps, and Gay's approach to a movie like that comes off far better (to again make a modern parallel: would Kael have liked “The Help” or would she have seen through that, too?).\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably the weakest moment in the book is her book-length essay “Raising Cain,” which is collected here in full. At the time, it was an incendiary shot at Orson Welles and Auteur Theory, arguing “Citizen Kane” was more the work of Herman Mankiewicz than Welles. Although it has it’s moments, particularly when dealing with Hollywood in the 30s, the essay is problematic: there are attribution issues where Kael claimed others work as her own; there are factual errors by Kael, too. I like the style and her essay is readable, but I also skimmed over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a little hard to recommend a book of this scale and size. It’s a little unwieldy to carry around and the reviews are both too long and too few to really make it worthwhile as a companion to, say, Leonard Maltin’s books. (Kael's might be a better choice there). But I’d still recommend it for anyone who enjoys reading good criticism, is interested in film or in writing their own criticism. For me, it has a nice spot next to .\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing about Kael isn’t her wit (although it’s nice), but the way poked into and at movies. I don’t think it’s a cliché to say she loved film, since it so vividly comes through with her writing, in the way she could enjoy both pulpy fare like “The Re-Animator” and high-class works like “The Dead.” But her love wasn’t uncritical: if a movie had holes, she’d poke at them: why was a character motiviated? What did the lighting do for a scene? Does a script take the time to explain a character? Etc, etc, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "These days, movie criticism is largely left to the specialists who work off in a corner that nobody really reads. Wesley Morris won a Pulitzer for his work, but Grantland struggled to find an audience. Instead, people gravitate towards people like Ebert, who would sum a movie with a hand gesture, or TV critics who award flicks on a sliding scale of three to five stars. It’s kind of funny when some of the best criticism comes from Gregg Turkington and Tim Hidecker’s funny web series “On Cinema at the Cinema.” So go back to Kael, go back and read about some movies you’ve forgotten or never seen, and enjoy yourself. I certainly did.\n",

      "Note: this is a twelve-hundred page book. I didn't read it all, but focused mainly on reviews and essays on the movies I've seen. I maybe covered about an eighth of the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I picked this up after seeing the recent documentary Life Itself on the life of Roger Ebert, noting the huge influence Kael had on his reviewing, and realizing I had read little to none of her work. Overall, it's powerful stuff --- Kael is especially good at separating craft from art while at the same time noting the joy that can come from each. She adores DePalma and Burton, while she is happy to note the flaws in Scorcese. (I agree with her about Raging Bull.) Even with her aesthetic tone, she never shies away from the idea of the movies as a business, and I found that some of her more insightful comments involved how some stars limited themselves more and more as their popularity rose. The latter point is hit hard in a long essay on Cary Grant, where she claims that only Hitchcock's involvement (along with the movie Charade) kept Grant's star bright after the forties. (Kael claims Grant only plays himself in the Hitchcock films, not that she's complaining.) Definitely entertaining and thought-provoking, and the volume (which excerpts her other works) gives an interesting view of cinema history.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "If you want to read great criticism, this is the go-to woman. She wrote for the New Yorker for years and years. Kael's film reviews are laugh-out-loud funny. It may not be in this book, but I loved her review of The Sound of Music--which she hated. She called Andrews \"sexless\" with her boyish hair and unflappable optimism.\n",

      "Fantastic collection of reviews from Pauline Kael. I read reviews of the films I have seen, which came up to roughly half of this 1200+ page collection. Kael doesnt pull any punches and it gave me a healthy dose of perspective to read scathing reviews of what are now regarded as \"classics\" while they were being released. She also praises many films which were recieved poorly at the time of their release, suprising and delighting me.This collection also includes the book-length essay on the authorship of Citizen Cane titled \"Raising Cane\" which was a major highlight. Kael was an incisive critic and it's clear she had a vast knowledge of and respect for the inner workings of film. I hadn't read any Kael reviews before checking this book out and now I'm hungry for more.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Pauline Kael. There aren't too many people in any field that you can say \"that person is the best to ever do what they did\". Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Jimi Hendrix...Pauline Kael is that to movie criticism. The best there ever was, the one by which everyeone else will be measured. She was crazy smart, almost comically opinionated and man did she love movies. Whether or not you agree with her you will always know more about film and the movies you love or hate after having read her. A must for movie buffs. Simply, the best.\n",

      "This book actually had me at magicians and magic, but then it threw in lesbians and a disappearance mystery to seal the deal. Way to oversell the product there, like giving away free pizza and then making it fat free on top of it.\n",
      "Anyway, meet the Great Bravura. A scrappy kid who with her best friend Susie became a grand magic act. Well, maybe not so grand, she isn’t infamous like her father, the not so Great, cheating, lying and stealing Señor Bravura, who did a disappearing act on his family, leaving his teenage daughter to take care of her melodramatic gorgeous and completely useless mother and a baby brother. But Bravura is about to turn it all around, she just needs to swipe her layabout brother for a femme fatale to sex up her act.\n",
      "And boy, does she find one, a proper va va room of a lady, who sashays onto the stage and into Bravura’s affection safter answering the ad for magician’s assistant.\n",
      "So now it’s something of an uneven love triangle with Susie left in the dust. Susie loves Bravura and always has, but Bravura can’t possibly return her affections due to Susie’s Brooklyn accent. Loyalty is nice and all, but you gotta have class. And let’s face it, nothing’ll demolish sex appeal quicker than a cigarette or a trashy (any NYC) accent. So Bravura goes for class with her new lady love, a mysterious woman of considerably physical charms and some very disturbing ideas, for she is, after all, an adopted daughter of a Eastern European mystic and two equally mysticism steeped mothers. Soon, Bravura finds herself treading very dangerous waters, while trying to balance her new wife’s family, trying to reconcile with her own and so on. It all might prove to be one trick too far. But it’s fun to watch, like a magic act where the outcome is uncertain.\n",
      "It’s also fun to read, but like a lot of debuts, it struggles to find its legs. Tonally, it seems is isn’t quite sure what it’s going for. The dialogue is straight out of Mrs. Maisel, all machine gun delivery and quaint colloquial turns. Which frankly was offputting enough in Mrs. Maisel and that was just for laughs. So here it mainly distracts for an increasingly dark tone of the novel. There was much to do about magic (obviously), real and pretend and that went some strange places. Magical lesbian conception on the wedding night kind of strange places. The characters were interesting, very interesting and I loved the blending in of real life ones with the fictional ones, but at times too over the top. The femme fatale one, especially. But also Bravura’s relationship with her mother was pretty out there, is it Oedipus or Electra complex when it’s daughter/mother? Very messed up dependency.\n",
      "But the main thing was…the tone. Darker and darker at every turn, which was great, but with too many incongruent and/or distracting elements thrown in.\n",
      "Still though, I enjoyed this one. It was just the right length at 200 pages and featured a lot of elements I appreciate in fiction. Don’t know if I’d go as far as referring to it as magical, but it was definitely a good and original story about magic those who wield it. Recommended.\n",

      "Jill Dearman’s rich, hard-boiled noir debut novel The Great Bravura absolutely rocked my world!\n",
      "\n",
      "Set in the New York of 1947, The Great Bravura tells the story of a brazen female magician trying to come to terms with her feelings for two very different women. Bravura - the daughter of Señor Bravura (a renowned con artist) who walked out of her and her mother’s life when Bravura was 7 years old - performs a successful magic act at the Club Algeria with her faithful assistant and sometimes lover , an unpolished country girl with an big Brooklyn accent.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the club owner tells them that the routine needs new blood, Bravura and Susie audition for an assistant and meet the mysterious , with whom Bravura is instantly smitten. A romantic relationship quickly develops, with Susie becoming the third wheel, so when Susie vanishes from the Disappearing Box contraption, it's suspected that Bravura had a hand in dispatching her former best friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lena, who's a strange combination of smoldering temptress (complete with a cultish father figure and two lesbian mothers) and recalcitrant child, tries to lead Bravura down a dangerous path, but the magician eventually realizes that she must go back to her own disastrous past namely, her father's betrayal of her to find clues to Susie's disappearance and her own redemption.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I loved about the book is that it keeps you guessing till the last page. Everybody seems shady, who can you really trust? I can honestly say that the author has created something quite unique that will haunt your thoughts long after you’ve read it. I know that Book Club buddy D. and I both had to pick our jaws off the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "f/f\n",
      "\n",
      "Themes: wow, what a ride! Bravura’s mom was something else, that incestuous hold she has over her daughter is fascinating and creepy at the same time, I loved Lena though she was maybe the most ambiguous character of the whole lot, maybe I have a weakness for damaged goods.\n",

      "Jill Dearman's thrilling and suspenseful 'The Great Bravura' hooked me from the start (\"I'm innocent — of killing Susie, at least\"; what's she NOT innocent of?). I was drawn into the Bravura's Noirish world immediately. Dearman knows her genre, her era, how to write evocatively, economically, and foremost how to entertain. The love triangle and character conflicts rang true. Titillating feelings of impending doom kept me turning the page. Fans of Patricia Highsmith and Sarah Waters's 'Tipping the Velvet' will devour and return to this book. If you love a good mystery (and a sexy one to boot!), grab a copy before they disappear.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Jill Dearman has written a brilliant novel! I'm a fan of great noir films like 'Double Indemnity' and 'Mildred Pierce' and this harkens back to them and the books they were based on. If you love those old movies you'll love this novel too. Fun, fast, outlandish and sly, grab your popcorn, turn on the night light, and enjoy a true page-turner.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The Great Bravura has a gritty noir feel of a 'Perry Mason' (the old b&w series) or to use a more recent example, the 'Mad Men' series. The characters are stark and larger than life, and I could see and feel the early to mid 20th century when I read the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do have an issue or two with the book, though. There is way too much emphasis on sex for my taste. Some may say it's because it features a romance between or amongst, if you count Susie) women. The truth is I don't want to see any graphic PDAs (public displays of affection), regardless of who makes up the participants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once Lena enters the picture, Bravura behaves like a love-struck teenager. The only thing (or person) she can think of is Lena. For me, the storyline begins to get muddied in and secondary to the description of sexual attraction, fantasies and acts. Does the author seek to entertain or arouse her audience?\n",
      "\n",
      "Once Susie takes a powder, the story gains top hand again. I stuck with it because I made an agreement to review the book. If I had not, I might not have made it past Susie's disappearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not saying Bravura is not a good book, and want to make that clear. Just because a book is not something I might search out, has no bearing on the quality of the book. (Ok, there is one exception, but this book is not it. That is another story for another day.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt a lot of sympathy for Susie. She is like the wife who watches her marriage fall apart in front of her eyes. Been there, done that. It sucks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line for me? If you like a noir story with a lot (!) of heat and are not put off by the fact that it is all female, you will like The Great Bravura. If any of those elements are not your cup of tea, keep looking through the shelves.\n",

      "The tone is genial and Carl Thompson balances opposing viewpoints judiciously. And, where appropriate, examples are provided through close readings of short extracts from a small group of diverse (if mostly Anglophone) authors: William Dampier, Walter Ralegh, Laurence Sterne, Maria Graham, John Ross, Henry Morton Stanley, Graham Greene, W G Sebald, Peter Biddlecombe, Bill Bryson, and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thompson is especially good on what he calls (borrowing from Stephen Shapin) 'epistemological decorum': how codes of plausibility and standards of accuracy change over time, although he might also have embellished this with some remarks on the impact of increasing numbers of readers knowledgeable about the places travel writers describe, many of them local residents.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I liked the way the chapter on gender and sexuality includes a section on the ways in which gender codes influence travel writing (dictating what kinds of activities and attitudes are proper to their accounts if they are to be taken seriously) as well as those authored by women. In a book of this length no topic can be treated in depth; even so, a single paragraph on gay travel writing seems unduly cursory.\n",

      "This historical romance is set in the middle ages on the craggy Isle of Mull. Events surround a real event in history – the battle between Alexander III and king Haakon of Norway for control of the Western Isles – but the politics and indeed much of the cultural referencing of the setting and the era are outside its scope; it is much more romance than history.\n",
      "At the centre of the novel is the burgeoning relationship between Shoney and Ronan. Shoney is the last in a long line of healing women, a legitimate descendant of the defunct royal Pictish line and the lone remaining adherent on the island to the old religion. These three factors render her effectively outcast from the community and in no way suitable as a wife for Ronan, the heir to the Chiefdom. But their compatibility is also compromised by their understanding of the role and abilities of women; Ronan is used to subservient females who need his protection and special care. Shoney is feisty, independent and opinionated, trained to defend herself if necessary and unwilling to compromise her beliefs and heritage for the sake of pragmatism or, for that matter, for Ronan. This central dichotomy made for interesting narrative tension; in terms of determination, intellect, education and strength of character these two were evenly matched. I was convinced by the characterisation and felt torn between Ronan’s practical desire for compromise and Shoney’s fierce desire to be true to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, however, this conflict is undermined by the almost ridiculously unequal nature of their physicality. Shoney is portrayed as petite to the point of being almost pocket-sized – certainly, in comparison to Ronan, who is as broad, burly and as lavishly muscled as a champion body-builder. At times it felt like Thumbelina meets the Incredible Hulk, which was a shame because it dented the much more interesting, because equal, clash between them. A woman may be expert with a bow, articulate in argument and learned in lore, but if she can be picked up like a child and carried off against her will, these qualities become irrelevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sex, on the other hand, is great. Ms Baldwin orchestrates the physical skirmishes really well – from attraction, to flirtation, a touch of rough-housing, gallant attempts at self-control given up for numerous joyous and enthusiastic couplings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The language of the novel is accessible, the style designed to keep the plot moving fluidly. Some evocative but not extensive descriptions rendered the setting just sufficiently. There was tension, however, between the medieval Scottish idiom (‘tis, oft,) and the entirely modern turns of phrase which sometimes crept in. The over-use of ‘likely’ began to irk after a while (why not ‘maybe’, ‘perhaps,’ ‘probably,’?) as did the repeatedly incorrect arrangement of punctuation at the end of direct speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "The combination of a woman whose independence and intelligence is unusual for her era with a man whose mind is not quite dominated by his machismo is a tried and tested recipe for combative romance. This book is a cousin to Diana Gabaldon’s Outlander series; although lacking in the impeccable historical detailing and the time shift dimension its central relationship has a similar appeal. There are shades, too, of Ayla and Jondalar in Jean Auel’s Earth’s Children opus. Though much less weighty than either of those, this novel scratches a similar itch.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I absolutely loved this book. The main characters are compelling both as individuals and as a couple. Shoney, the beautiful 'Witch of Dervaig', has a fierce independence that's very contemporary, but her spirituality roots her in the novel's time and place (early medieval Scotland). Ronan, the son of the clan leader, is torn between his sense of duty and his love for Shoney, and this sense of duty is given real complexity and urgency through the real historical clan rivalries and battles with which he's concerned. I loved the depiction of friendships between men and between women, which makes the battle scenes so poignant... you really feel for the community as a whole and not just the lead characters throughout the book. There's just enough historical detail to make the story very real, but not so much that the plot (and characters) suffers. This is, after all, a romance novel, and an intelligent one at that, but the love story is at the heart of this novel. With this in mind, the sex scenes are passionate and erotic, as opposed to explicit.\n",
      "The plot moves along at a very good pace, and I found myself reading well after my bedtime as I kept trying to read 'just one more chapter'! I ended up buying the paperback after reading the kindle version, as I wanted to keep this one to read and read again. What a treat!\n",

      "I loved this book, was recommended it by a friend who has never failed to pass on great reads, and she was true to form. The atmosphere Lily Baldwin creates in this novel is superb, I was drawn in from the start. The main Characters Shoney and Ronan come from different worlds socially and yet each have a fierce sense of their identities and responsibilities. Shoney is a character who could come from any period in history, her bravery and loyalty shine through, but her struggles with her feelings are timeless. Ronan is a warrior, unashamedly male. Just the kind of leading man I like! His frustrations and passions bring him alive, and the pull of his duty versus love dilemma is explored cleverly. The supporting characters add depth and create a community I felt drawn in to, with Aidan (Ronan's best friend) adding humour and poignancy. This is a historical romance novel where the history comes naturally. Lily Baldwin's writing ensured the characters made me really root for them. Passions run high in this book, in love and in war. I am intrigued by the lead hinting at the next instalment, looking forward to reading more of the Clan MacKinnon.\n",

      "The books is divided into four sections with a conclusion. In section one, Ryle begins with reasons for his exhorting young men. In section two, he then focuses on five specific dangers which young men to be warned of (e.g. pride, the love of pleasure, the fear of man���s opinions, etc.). In section three, he outlines some general suggestions which he entreats young men to receive and then in section four he lays down some practical specific “rules of conduct” which he strongly advises young men to follow. Ryle then concludes with the results of heeding such exhortations as he has laid out.\n",

      "I adored Cassie. She is a strong and independent woman. Even though she was in danger, she was determined to protect those around her. I liked that she was a marine, she put herself into danger to protect others, she was a hero. I loved her attitude and her speech to Stryker. I liked Cash, Orlando, Coast, Memphis and Stryker. I will admit that I wanted to see more of them and their personalities. This book was focused on Cassie, which I understood but I wanted to see her bond more with the heroes. Although I liked all of the men, I had a major soft spot for Stryker. I liked that Cassie stood up to him and shown him her scars. I liked the bond they have and part of my heart melted when Stryker accepted Cassie.\n",

      "Another awesome story !! Dixie Lynn Dwyer's well written stories are a must read for me. This one has deeply emotional characters, an interesting plot, and super hot sex and ménage. Cassidy is a Marine Corpsman, RN and surgical RN, but she's also a decorated combat Marine. She's on the run from her ex who threatened her life. In Tranquility she find ex military who want her, and will protect and care for her. Their relationship expands and even Stryker wants her. He's still battling his scars, using a cane, and feeling depressed. Cass knows just what to say to shake him up. Cash, Coast, Orlando, Stryker and Memphis are perfect for her. There is a lot more happening here with her old friend, Lynn, and Red, Cash's dad, plus the great people of this town, but I won't give it all away. In the end they all prove to her that they are concerned and dedicated to her safety. I loved the character who ended up taking the kill shot to her ex. Wow ! Fast paced, compassionate, caring, emotional, loving, and accepting, this tale has it all. You will be happy you read this. Highly recommend. ENJOY !!\n",

Although Dixie's heroines are always strong Cassidy was even more. I love the fact that the town of Tranquility always look out for each other and is full of retired soldiers . Cassidy's men were amazing to her and really helped her just as she helped them especially Stryker. Their alone time was so sweet and special. A great must read!\n",

      "This was a perfectly serviceable book, with many, many good texts in it, including all of Paradise Lost, the Canterbury Tales, and other fascinating works. My only gripe is this: they didn't get the best translations. With the medieval texts, especially, they would keep them with the older wording, where every word has to have a footnote in order to be understood. I'm not talking about Shakespeare, I'm talking about \"By housbondrie, of swich as God hir sente, / She foond hirself and eek hire doghtren two.\" This is really hard to get through, and I ended up looking up a more modern translation of some pieces on the internet (which were very enjoyable, by the way).\n",

My community college library, when I ordered Clayton's Oxford edition, kept buying cheaper editions that did not have this verse.

      "As for the play of Shakespeare's, when I started it was 1Henry4, a great play, but very male-dominated. My community college was two-thirds women students, so I preferred Measure for Measure or Much Ado, or even Othello. All these choices are of course determined by other anthologies as well, notably freshman comp and lit which came to include Othello (hence redundant in sophomore lit). One of my better students, once she graduated and attended a state college in Boston, returned to tell me she had had Oedipus required five times in her four years. Freshman English, sophomore psychology, junior history and psychology, and senior something-or-other. In other words, there IS no curriculum. Each course reconstitutes its own.\n",

I would intersperse readings from English law and history I had found in my many postdocs at Princeton, Brown, Harvard, the Folger, etc. Also, Clarendon's History of the Rebellion, especially his description of Charles II's Portuguese wife. Gracious, French-raised Charles of course introduced his new wife to his mistress within a week of her landing in England with her household of black widow attendants. Should be in the NA for its prose and its insight into comparative cultures. (Since my students were predominately Portuguese, Brazilian and Azorean, they were attentive.)\n",

Wherever you are now, whatever you are doing, I truly hope that life has repaid you generously for the fine work you did with us. I breezed through college English courses in large part because you taught me everything I needed to know. All the rest was just picking good reading lists. Thank you, again. You are part of my brilliant English teacher triumvirate, along with Mr. Rosenberg (6th) and Mr. Schuszler (7th). And how sad is it that all three of you guys stopped teaching?\n",

      "Eleni Gage’s The Ladies of Managua is multigenerational novel that follows the lives of grandmother, Isabela; her daughter, Ninexin; and granddaughter, Maria. Isa reflects on lost love, Ninexin on her husband’s death, and Maria on her rocky relationship with her mother. Each woman carries a secret which comes to light when they come together for Isa’s husband’s funeral in Nicaragua.\n",
      "The Ladies of Managua is an enjoyable read that focuses on love, loss, and the rocky relationship between mothers and daughters.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This book is written in the first person, from the viewpoint of three women, Isabela, Ninexin, and Maria. Isabela is 78 years old and mother to Celia and Ninexin. She and her husband Ignacio raised Maria, because Ninexin was a freedom fighter in the Nicaraguan revolution and then became a government minister too busy to raise a child by herself. Ninexin's husband Manuel died in the revolution.\n",
      "Maria is now manager of an art gallery in New York city and living with Allen, a painter who is more interested in his paintings than Ninexin. Ignacio dies and all three women come together for his funeral. There is a lot of emotion between the three women and I could not read more than 10-15 pages a day, because it was such an emotional book. I even stopped reading it for a few days to give my brain a rest. Think of the movie \"Terms of Endearment\" with its mother daughter issues. Isabela also pines for the man, Mauricio, that she wanted to marry but was stopped at the altar by her parents.\n",
      "Some quotes: Ninexin on her relationship with Maria(Mariana) \"I lose Mariana again every time I see her and I never seem to get any better at it.\"\n",
      "Maria talking about her grandfather: \"...whose soul, Dona Olga said, is supposed to be hovering for the next forty days.\"\n",
      "Isabela:...if you live long enough, you start to lose the need to please everyone else all of the time.\"\n",
      "I liked the descriptive Nicaraguan atmosphere--myths, description of wildlife, colorful houses and kind people.\n",
      "The healing process begins about 2/3rds of the way in and by the end, there is peace for all three women. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if it was not so far out of my usual reading genres--mystery/biography/history. I would classify this book as women's fiction.\n",
      "Isabela has some laugh out lines in the final third of the book.\n",
      "I rate it 3.5 stars(rounded up to4) out of 5 stars.\n",
      "Thanks to the publisher for sending me this book through the Goodreads Giveaway program.\n",

      "Three generations of women meet at Abuelo´s (Ignacio) funeral in Granada, Nicaragua. There´s Isabela, the grandmother & widow of Ignacio, Ninexin, their daughter who is a Sandinista and current government official, and Mariana (or Maria, for short) who is the third generation and Ninexin´s grown daughter. Each women has a secret that is revealed during their reunion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isabela´s great love was not her husband, but Mauricio whom she met while in high school at Sacred Heart in New Orleans. They had planned to elope but her father found out about the wedding and stopped it. She returned to Nicaragua and eventually marrying Ignacio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ninexin was a Sandanista revolutionary whose husband, Manuel, was also a revolutionary. He was shot and killed on mission during the war. Ninexin had her baby, Mariana, shortly before the shootout. For her daughters safety, she allowed her parents to take Mariana to Miami to raise her. She has never felt close to her daughter and is jealous of the closeness between Isabela and Mariana.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maria (as she goes by now) is an artist working in an art gallery in NYC. She has a boyfried, Allan, who followed her to Nicaragua much to the surprise of everyone. She is also pregnant.\n",
      "\n",
      "This novel is told through the eyes and thoughts of all three women. Each chapter is named for one of them and the story progresses through her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great story of \"the one great love\" in our lives and the love shared between mothers/daughters/grandmothers. Wonderful story. I didn´t care too much for the ending but I see a sequel in the making.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This book had me from the start. The story of Isabel and her daughters, seemingly opposite personalities come together for their father's funeral. But the part I enjoyed the most was Isabel's descriptions of her childhood and then as a young adult. All of the places, from boarding school in New Orleans to the Nicaragua of her youth and of today, give the reader a real sense of belonging. So very descriptive and inviting. I would highly recommend this and think it will make a good book club selection, probably when it is out in paperback. thank you netgalley for letting me review this galley.\n",

The rust monster, land shark, and owl-bear were originally cheap plastic monster toys from Hong Kong that Gygax used as handy monsters miniatures. As contrast, 4th edition is focused around selling shitty, mass-produced \"official\" plastic miniatures. Imagination has no place in 21st century roleplaying!\n",

      "4e is the Twilight of roleplaying games. It's the edition that everyone loves to hate, but although I admit I've ranted about it's flaws on-and-off since I started playing D&D, I still like 4e.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it as good as Pathfinder? No. There aren't nearly as many character options, the feats are awful, each fight takes hours, and it's really hard to fiddle with the system as a DM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I've just thrown out a lot of opinion there without qualifying it; in a complete breakdown of logic, it is the 'badness' (technical term) of the mechanics which is why I like 4e.\n",
      "\n",
      "To put it bluntly, 4e is bad because it tells you what to do and how to do it. Every class uses 'powers', a very video-gamey concept that locks each class into it's niche and doesn't allow much room for improvisation or roleplay. You don't say 'I'm going to draw my sword, kick down the door and charge the orc chieftain, howling a blood-curdling war-cry', you say 'I'm going to activate my power attack stance and use my basic attack on the orc chieftain'. For an experienced player, it kills the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which is why I believe 4e wasn't designed for experienced players.\n",
      "\n",
      "For new players, it's amazing. I always had a hard time trying to convince other people to play D&D. I finally managed to get some of my friends at school (back when I was at school) to give 4th a try, and they liked it. It was easy to get into because it's what they were used to, except instead of on a screen, it was all on paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "4e has chapters dedicated on how to roleplay, how to write a good character background, which is something that my main system, Pathfinder, never really goes into detail on. With Pathfinder, it's assumed you know these things already, whereas 4e assumes you've never touched a d20 before.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you enter into an entirely new hobby, especially one as alien as D&D, its nice to have a halfway-house like 4th edition, which is both familiar, and not. The learning curve is a lot less steep than Pathfinder or GURPs. So yes, 4e is the inferior system, but it has its place, and it does what it does very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I'll say one more thing. I don't play 4e with miniatures. Same goes for Pathfinder.\n",

      "Fight me.\n",

      "(Or don't, because as much as I like to play human fighters, I've never even gone near aggressive contact in real life, and I get the feeling I'd only be worth a bit of XP, at best.)\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Like most relatively satisfied 3.5 players, I was somewhat skeptical of 4th edition. But the more I heard about it, the more I liked, and now that I've started GMing the game, I would never go back. Running a 4th Edition game is *so* much more fun and tons easier as a GM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The adaptation of every class to an identical \"power\" system of at-will, daily and encounter is a good way to standardize learning the rules and applying them in play, but at the same time, there's a ton of variety in how the classes work. A party is now really integrated, with each character playing a different and important role. It's a little more structured than the multiclass-at-will 3.5 or even the chaotic nature of 1st and 2nd edition D&D, but it's also user-friendly and cinematic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The skills, updated from a big list to a focused list and now with a \"You either know how to do it a little bit or you're really good at it\" mechanic, are not terribly realistic, but they work for adventurers that should have a bit of jack-of-all-trades about them, and using them is a snap compared to the point-based system of 3.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feats, the key improvement of D&D 3rd edition, take a bit of a backseat to all the nifty powers, but they are a nice way to flesh out your character a bit and individualize them so that not every fighter looks alike, for example.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rituals are a good idea made overly complicated, and unfortunately the focus on combat has left wizards a bit bleh, in some ways. No more clever uses of silence or illusion magic, it's all blast and fire now, and silence, mage lock and other spells are relegated to long-winded, out-of-combat rituals. It's a nice idea, but it probably could have used more time in the workshop to really let the wizards shine, instead of just making them secondary blasters ala the new warlocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with all of WOTC's books, the organization is pretty terrible. The book looks beautiful, and it's actually a fairly readable book, which is not the standard for game manuals, but at the same time, it has a barely-functional one-page index (when it could have used something much more exhaustive) and the rules are not cross-referenced as heavily as they should be. A little more \"see page XX\" throughout would have been handy, especially given the uselessness of the index.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the organization and some minor rules issues are just that... minor problems. Overall, this is a slick, very playable upgrade of the system.\n",

      "At the risk of being marked a heretic, I'm going to give the 4th edition revision of Dungeons & Dragons four stars. Why?\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been playing D & D since the early 1980s, and though my fondness for the Tom Moldvay Basic Dungeons & Dragons and the 1st edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons knows very few bounds one has to admit that those iterations of the game rules were arcane at best. I recall how difficult it was to bring in new players; how daunting they found the rules structure; and the high learning curve involved in what often ended up being many contradictions... and the many holes plugged by house rules. D & D 4th edition, although not my favorite manifestation of the classic game, is without a doubt the most elegant and balanced game system of the bunch... if you look at it as purely a game system, it is superior to all the previous versions. Go ahead and throw the rotten eggs and veggies now...\n",
      "I have to further admit that I prefer the minor revision made to these rules in the , , and rule books -- the 4th edition system received its finest refinement in these publications. Still, I hold to my assertion that the rules don't matter as much as the enjoyment of the group playing and because of that I consider myself \"system agnostic.\" If I had to choose a personal preference at gun point, that continues to be the 3.5 revision of the D & D rules but I've recently run both 1st and 2nd edition AD&D games for players who had never been exposed to those rule sets, and we had a blast... and I've participated in the D&DNext Playtest, and that rule set is fine as well. Are any of these rule sets perfect? Hell no... of course not. Like many things in the wide world of fandom, we love these games often more for their imperfections and for the rousing good time they're all capable of creating.\n",

      "“I am your husband. When you feel lonely or afraid or unhappy, it is to me you must come, Chloe. My arms are here for you, and my strength too for whatever it is worth. You will never be a burden to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After her recent London visit sparked rumors about her life, Chloe Muirhead took refuge in Manville Court, the home of the Duke and Duchess of Worthingham. It was during her stay in Manville where she met Ralph Stockwood, the battle-wounded, both mentally and physically, heir of the Duke. He has a duty to marry and produce an heir and she dreams of marriage and children but knows no one would marry her now. Seeing Ralph’s situation as her last chance in changing her life, Chloe strikes a bargain with him: a marriage without feelings that would benefit them both. Although bewildered by her suggestion, Ralph found himself eventually agreeing to the lady’s proposition of an equally beneficial marriage without the complexities of emotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only A Promise is the fifth book from Mary Balogh’s historical romance series, The Survivors’ Club. This tells the story of Ralph Stockwood and Chloe Muirhead. I haven’t read a Mary Balogh book in months. I find that she is the type of author that is best read between long intervals to truly appreciate her work. I find her storytelling to be very slow and it can be both good and bad depending on the reader’s mood. I was exactly in the mood for a Mary Balogh book; there is a quality to her writing that distinguishes her from other authors in the genre. Her books aren’t exactly exciting, in fact it could be deemed boring, but I think her strength is how well she gives life to her characters and how she explores the very human emotions they feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chloe Muirhead is a pragmatic, if sometimes whiny, twenty seven years old spinster. The heroine is a character that one can easily warm to for she is sensible most of the time and she knows what she wants. She was eager to change her situation in life when given the opportunity and she was brave when she needed to be. She was thoughtful and understanding when she could just have been resentful. Chloe has once been burned by love, though I do not believe it was love, more like an infatuation towards someone who gave her attention she very much craved as a debutante. Her life has been nothing short of scandalous because of her family. The recent rumors being spread about her is what hurt her the most and pushed her to live for a while with the duchess. I could feel her wanting to believe something that she knows is a lie and the bitter acceptance of the truth. I feel like I got to know her well enough when I was reading the book and I fear I may not have the words to properly characterize her. I would have to say that she endeared herself to me because she felt very human. Even with all her strength, there were the random bouts of insecurity that I think is a charming quality to any character because it is perfectly normal to have one and makes them feel more real, if that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this hero is the most depressed Mary Balogh hero I’ve ever had the chance to encounter. Not that I read all of her books, in fact, I’ve only read four but thus far, he was the most unhappy, angsty Mary Balogh hero I’ve had. I didn’t know this author could do the whole tortured hero thing so well, but she did and I am quite impressed. Ralph Stockwood is a deeply wounded man both physically and mentally. I feel for him. There was so much internal dialogue which didn’t annoy me, I even liked it because I felt closer to him and it was instrumental in getting to know his character better. He was scared to be vulnerable, to be dependent on someone, let alone his new wife because of the experiences that changed his life and the way he was. He was a scarred officer, a wounded man, who is forever embittered. I think he was portrayed quite realistically. This is one of the heroes I’ve read wherein he felt resentment for the heroine even when she didn’t do anything but care for him, he was irritated with her presence and yet she was his wife, and he was jealous of her courage when he felt he had none. He can be disagreeable but then it was also obvious that he cares deeply for his wife even when he is reluctant to do so. He resented her energy because he didn’t want to depend on someone and yet his new wife proved to be very efficient. It was the things about her that irritated him that made him eventually love her. It might be a bit off-putting to some readers but I think the development of his feelings towards the heroine was written well and is in character of who he was and who he is. He was a hard man to love but at the same time he wasn’t because he showed his fondness for his wife in a way he knows how.\n",
      "\n",
      "I actually really liked reading this book. Mary Balogh has such a way with words that I found myself highlighting many passages just because they were written beautifully. The way she characterized Ralph and Chloe was well done. I love the way her books are written because she doesn’t sound too modern and actually sounds era-appropriate without sounding too contrived. This was a historical romance but at its core it was a story about two wounded souls who heal with the help of each other, the acceptance of the truth and letting go of burdens, and the love that is not mere infatuation but a love that was gradually developed between the two of them even when neither were very agreeable at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the good things about this book is the strong familial relationships and friendships. I loved Chloe’s story and even more Sir Kevin Muirhead and his unconditional love for Chloe despite the truth of her birth. I also really enjoyed her brother, Graham, whose relationship with Ralph bordered on complicated but they eventually formed a true friendship at the end which I very much appreciated. Of course, there were the Old Duke and Duchess who were kind to Chloe and took her in when she was afraid of facing the truth regarding the rumors. I wasn’t expecting to be very affected but I found myself being somehow sad about the Old Duke’s passing, mostly because of what the dowager duchess said afterwards. How very true and scary that life can be taken away in one moment and words that were never said can never be uttered now that they’re gone. It was a book that went beyond romance, there was the exploration of mental health, despair, and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary Balogh is a master at creating a relationship that is believable and something that goes beyond lust. I noticed that she isn’t particularly the best at writing bed scenes but I think it adds charm and uniqueness to her work. Sometimes, all I want is to read a romance that can be felt and proven without sex scenes that do not add to progress of the plot / relationship. This one had some explicit scenes but weren't really detailed which I actually appreciated. It was implied but at least there wasn’t a whole chapter of them doing it. Do not judge me, sometimes I just am not in the mood to read such scenes because they are somehow boring when repeated. What she focused on was these characters working on themselves, defeating their fears, letting go of their worries and in doing so accepting their love for each other when both thought the marriage wouldn’t involve feelings at first.\n",
      "\n",
      "She writes such slow paced books. There wasn't any big drama to make the characters realize their fondness of each other. But even so, I think it was well worth the read. This was just a book of two people who are initially reluctant to love and yet found themselves doing so. I loved how the heroine reached out to the hero and how she cared for him, although I did not necessarily agree with her saying that she didn’t love him in a romantic way. She wasn’t in love with him in a way most innocent and naive younger people are with their partners but she did love him romantically and more. Anyway, this was a realistic take on a marriage of convenience and it was boring at times, as it would be in reality. But I found myself invested in the book and rooting for the characters to have their happily ever after! I would have appreciated an epilogue but the last chapter would do as I thought it was sweet. The love declaration wasn’t the most emotional MB I’ve read but it was still good. Honorable mention to Kit and Lauren. I enjoyed seeing their names mentioned! They are by far my favorite Mary Balogh couple. Also, Lord Aidan Bedwyn! I still think he should’ve pursued his career instead of Eve, sorry not sorry. Anyway, this was a good book especially perfect when one is in the mood for a well-written romance between a flawed hero and a heroine who tries her best to be understanding. There is a sweetness in Chloe that endeared her character to me. What really sealed the deal for me is when she cut her hair and was wailing and Ralph didn’t know how to comfort her but still did! It was such a cute moment and one of my favorite scenes in the book. It was the little moments and small progresses that if the reader paid attention to would make them realize when and how they fell in love with each other.\n",

      "4.5 stars, rounded up.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the books in Mary Balogh’s Survivor’s Club series take as their central protagonist a character who has been seriously injured by war. Sometimes these are physical injuries, as with Sir Benedict Harper (of The Escape) who lost the use of his legs, and sometimes they are mental, as with Flavian Ponsonby (hero of the previous book – and my favourite of the series so far - Only Enchanting). In each case, the author has approached her characters’ injuries and disabilities sensitively and un-sentimentally, showing how difficult it has been for each of them to regain anything resembling a normal life following their terrible experiences, and has matched each of them so far with a heroine who has her own, though different, dragons to slay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ralph Stockwood is Earl of Berwick and heir to his grandfather, the Duke of Worthingham. The duke is ailing, and Ralph knows that it is past time for him to his duty – he must marry and produce a son as soon as possible so as to ensure the succession. He won’t shirk his duty, but is far from overjoyed at the prospect of having to select a wife from the year’s crop of simpering misses just out of the schoolroom. He returned from war a very different man to the outgoing, optimistic one who went off, accompanied by his closest friends, to fight for king and country; and even though he has returned to society following the three years he spent convalescing at Penderris Hall with his fellow Survivors, he is plagued by an inner darkness and a feeling of emptiness that makes him reluctant to condemn any young woman to a life with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chloe Muirhead is the grand-daughter of the duchess’s dearest friend, and is on an indefinite visit to Manville Court. Her life has been tainted by scandal, none of it of her making. Her first season had to be delayed due to mourning so she did not make her début until she was twenty-one, making her several years older than that year’s crop of eager, marriageable young misses. She nonetheless garnered an offer of marriage, but her fiancé cried off when her younger sister ran off with a married man, by whom she was expecting a child. Some years later, Chloe returned to society, only to find herself “cut” by the ton, because of speculation about her parentage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Humiliated once more, Chloe fled London, her hopes of marriage and children dashed – but she needed some breathing space away from home, hence her stay with the duke and duchess.\n",
      "\n",
      "She overhears a discussion between Ralph and his grandmother in which they discuss his need for a wife, and Chloe thinks that perhaps she has a solution to both their problems. Even though she finds Ralph somewhat forbidding, she suggests to him that they marry. She wants to be married and he to be married – she will give him an heir, and he will give her a home and a comfortable life. But love, romance and affection are most definitely NOT on the table as far as Ralph is concerned, he does not wish Chloe to know him or he to know her. Chloe’s main wish is to live the rest of her life well away from the glare of London society, and as Ralph is as keen to do that as she is, she is content with what is on offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Marriage of Convenience is probably my favourite trope in historical romance, so the premise of this story naturally appealed to me very much. I enjoyed watching Ralph and Chloe coming to the gradual realisation that it is not feasible –or desirable – to live a life devoid of companionship at the very least. Chloe senses the emptiness inside Ralph, but because of their bargain, doesn’t ask him about it, no matter that she knows it’s eating away at him. He keeps reminding her that he’s a shell of a man with nothing to offer – he has been so badly traumatised by the things he experienced during the war that he has walled off his emotions and wishes never to feel again. There are times, I admit, when Ralph is difficult to like because of the way he treats Chloe and deliberately shuts her out, sometimes quite cruelly. There are reasons for this, of course, but it is still difficult to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chloe is an engaging heroine, and I liked her rather fatalistic approach to life. None of the problems she has encountered are her fault, and even though she is more or less resigned to an uneventful life, she puts on a brave face and just gets on with it. Her proposal to Ralph takes a lot of courage, as do many of the things she does later in the book, and if I have a niggle, it's that it takes her a bit too long to protest her husband’s sometimes callous treatment of her in the early stages of their marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ralph’s emotional scars run deep and his journey back to the land of the living is a difficult one. Chloe has fears of her own to face, too, but face them she does, with Ralph’s help and support. His growing realisation that he can’t maintain his emotional distance from Chloe, and the way in which she gradually worms her way under his skin and into his heart are very well-portrayed and often very poignant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ralph and Chloe are well-drawn, sympathetic characters, and one of their strengths as a couple is that, despite a rocky start, they actually TALK to each other and behave like responsible adults. There is an equally strong secondary cast, in particular Ralph’s grandparents and Chloe’s brother, Graham, and a number of the other Survivors make cameo appearances. In spite of the small reservations I’ve mentioned, is a terrific read, and certainly a worthy addition to this enjoyable series.\n",

      "“Doar o promisiune”, este povestea lui Chloe și a lui Ralph. O poveste plină de emoție, de durere și suferință, a două suflete mult prea rănite.\n",
      "Chloe nu este bine văzută de aristocrația londoneză după ce sora ei a fugit cu un bărbat căsătorit, chiar dacă, după aceea cei doi au devenit soț și soție. Dar asta nu este totul. A mai fost un scandal când o tânără debutantă și-a făcut apariția în Londra și societatea a observat că tânăra seamănă foarte bine cu Chloe...\n",
      "A fost rănită și deziluzionată de aceste două întâmplări care au marcat-o, a suferit când tot vălul inocenței s-a destrămat cu atâta ușurință. Dar cel mai tare a durut-o că a ajuns să se îndoiască de proprii părinți.\n",
      "Pe de altă parte îl avem pe Ralph, un tânăr conte care s-a lăsat condus de instincte în tinerețe, a decis să plece în război contra lui Napoleon. Ba chiar și-a luat cu el și cei trei prieteni foarte buni. Dar soarta nu a fost îngăduitoare, aceștia și-au pierdut viața chiar sub ochii lui. De atunci a rămas marcat.\n",
      "Se simte vinovat, nu are curajul să mai dea ochii cu părinții acestora; ba mai mult, propriile răni căpătate în război, care l-au marcat și i-au pus viața în pericol par a fi nimic pe lângă sufletul lui măcinat de vinovăție. În primele luni după întoarcerea acasă din război, acesta a încercat chiar să își ia viața...\n",
      "Astfel, datorită acestei încercări nereușite a ajuns să facă parte din Clubul Supraviețuitorilor. Acești 7 membri au fost familia lui, alături de ei s-a recuperat fizic și a încetat să-și mai dorească moartea.\n",
      "Soarta îi aduce împreună pe Ralph și Chloe, care se cunosc în casa bunicilor lui și se căsătoresc cu o zi înainte ca bunicul său să moară. Înțelegerea lor este destul de simplă: copii și lipsa emoțiilor este ceea ce-și dorește el, ea este de acord deoarece vrea să aibă o casă și copii, o identitate de care să nu se mai îndoiască.\n",
      "Dar, deși aranjamentul acesta pare a funcționa, fiecare dintre ei constată că emoțiile încearcă să-și facă apariția. Iar ei luptă din toate puterile cu aceste emoții.\n",

      "Un cuplu mult prea încercat, care se vede nevoit să-și îndepărteze barierele cu atâta suferință și lacrimi construite.\n",

      "When Chloe hears of Ralph’s predicament, she makes an offer of marriage with no expectations of emotional ties or love from him. She provides an heir, takes care of the house and Ralph can go on about with his life without much changing. Oh, how naïve we can be, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "I adored Chloe! I admired her strength and courage, her determination to rely on herself to take what happiness she could from life and not to expect others to give it to her. She wasn’t bitter when Ralph was distant or pulled away after opening up to her, because she never expected him to in the first place. She counted every amount of tenderness he offered her as a happy surprise, but didn’t want to put too much stock in it and have her heart crushed by relying on it.\n",

      "Ralph was happily surprised that Chloe enjoyed sex just as much as he did. It would be impossible not to form some emotional bond, not to fall in love when you allow someone in enough to enjoy sex on a regular basis, especially if you sleep with them, and grow attached to their presence in your bed every night. Chloe and Ralph were sincerely good people and therefore saw the good in each other, and that admiration along with physical attraction inevitably turned into love, much as neither wanted to admit it. Chloe and Ralph, with all their intentions of keeping at arm’s length emotionally, provided each other the support and motivation to face their fears and confront their individual baggage from the past.\n",

      "For a beautiful historical romance that will tug at your heart, and fill you with joy, Mary Balogh’s Survivors’ Club series cannot be missed. was a gradual build toward love, full of small steps forward and some occasional steps back. Both the progress and the digression pulled at my emotions! While the story is part of the Survivors’ Club series, it’s not necessary to read the other books to enjoy . I did read Only Enchanting, the book previous, and completely loved it, though.\n",

      "It's an interesting and worthy idea, writing a series of romances about a group of men and a woman who have been deeply damaged by the Napoleonic Wars in Regency England times.

      "Whatever else I am, I am the type of person who reads classic novels out of a sense of obligation. Also, I must admit, out of a sense of vanity. My ego, after all, is as fragile as a goldfish and requires the constant attention of a newborn baby. Every once in awhile, it needs a little boost, and the intellectual challenge of Dostoevsky or Dickens can really work wonders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I’ve been told that forcing myself to read books I don’t necessarily like is a fruitless waste of time (and that the reviews borne of these endeavors are a fruitless waste of others’ time). That kind of criticism doesn’t go far with me. By my rough estimate, just about 99% of the things I do can be similarly classified as a waste of time, unless my endless games of Spider Solitaire, like “the button” on , is actually saving the world. In which case I am a hero.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, great literature can be a worthwhile challenge to surmount. Compare them to mountains. Obviously, we don’t need people to climb mountains; it serves no functional purpose. Yet, on a personal level, climbing a mountain (even if it’s just a Class 3 walk-up) is immensely satisfying, mentally and physically. On some level, it’s the same with finishing a tough book. (Mentally, that is. There is very little physical component, unless you defenestrate the book upon completion).\n",
      "\n",
      "is a challenge I set for myself. It was a challenge a long time coming. The reason, of course, is that is the go-to book when looking for an example of great literature, or for a contender for “greatest novel ever written.” If it is not exactly Everest or K2 (those are Joycean heights), it is at least comparable to Annapurna or Mount McKinley.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, it is a book I wrestled with constantly. Unlike Doris from , I never considered quitting, only to start back up again the following year. However, there were times my frustrations almost led me to tear huge swaths of pages from the binding, as a primitive editing job. Like so many of the things you are told, as a child, are magical – the circus, love, magic – did not entirely live up to its reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you were to ask me, would you rather retreat from Moscow in the dead of winter than read this book, I would say: \"Of course not. I don’t like walking, I don’t like being hungry, and I’d probably die.” But if I had to choose between, say, tarring the driveway or mowing the lawn and reading this book... Again, I’d choose the book. Nothing beats reading. Besides, I’m lazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where to start? With a (second) rhetorical question: What's about?\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a good question, and nobody really knows. (Though many will attempt to explain). There have been longer books – both you and I have read them – but this is 1,200 pages that feels like 1,345,678,908 pages. Nominally, it's about Russia's wars with Napoleonic France from 1804 to 1813. If that seems like a big subject, don’t worry, Tolstoy has given himself plenty of space with which to work. It follows dozens of characters in and out of the decades, as they live and die, love and hate, and generally stun the modern reader with their obtuseness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first sixty pages of the novel are a set piece in the Petersburg salon of Anna Pavlovna. You don't have to remember that, though, because Anna Pavlovna will only stick around these first sixty pages, then disappear for almost the entire rest of the book. We are also introduced to Pierre, who is, literally, a fat bastard; Prince Andrei, who is a prick; his wife Lisa, the little princess, who as Tolstoy keeps telling us, has a beautiful mustache (Tolstoy's obsession with beautiful female mustaches is pathological, and not a little frightening); Prince Vassily, who also disappears after a squabble over a will; and various other Russian aristocrats. Readers note: you should probably be writing things down as you read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other introductions come later, including Andrei's father, who is also a prick (apple, meet the tree); Andrei's insufferably \"good\" and \"pure\" and \"decent\" and \"homely\" sister, Princess Marya, who's goodness is as cloying and infuriating as that of Esther is ; Natasha Rostov, who is sort of a tramp, much like Anna Karenina except that she is redeemed through suffering (unlike Anna, who is redeemed through mass transit); Nikolai Rostov, a young prince who goes to war; Sonya, the simple, poor girl Nikolai loves, etc. I could go on, but it wouldn't make sense if you haven't read the book. It barely makes sense after you've finished. Unless, of course, you’ve kept good notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, Pierre, the bastard, is left his father's estate, and so becomes a rich count. He marries Helene, who is another of Tolstoy's harlots, though she gets her comeuppance, Anna Karenina-style. (There are two types of women in Tolstoy’s world: the impossibly pure-hearted and the whorish. Subtlety is not a Russian trait). Prince Andrei goes to war. Nikolai goes to war. They fight. Everyone else talks. An enjoyably characterized Napoleon flits briefly across this crowded stage, tugging on people's ears. The Rostov's have financial difficulties. Nikolai can't decide who to marry. Pierre has several dozen crises of conscience. At one point he becomes a Mason; at another, he tries to assassinate Napoleon. At all times he is thinking, always thinking; there are approximately 500 pages devoted to Pierre's existential duress. (How I wished for Pierre to throw himself beneath a train!)\n",
      "\n",
      "There is an old saying that “if the world could write…it would write like Tolstoy. That’s one way of viewing . It has a canvas as big as Russia, and within its pages are dizzying high and nauseating lows and bland, lukewarm middles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bottom line before I go on, Tolstoy-style, is that I was disappointed. My main criticism is the unfortunate mishmash of fictional narrative with historical essay. You're reading the book, right? (Or maybe listening to it on a long commute). And you're finally getting a hang of who each character is (because you’ve taken my advice and sketched out a character list), which is difficult when each person is called multiple things, and some have nicknames, and others have similiar-looking patronymics. But that's okay, you've moved past that. Suddenly, you're coasting along. The story is moving forward. Napoleon has crossed the Danube. There is drama. Finally, people are going to stop with the internal monologues and start shooting each other! I might actually like this!\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, with an almost audible screech, like the brakes a train, Tolstoy brings the whole thing to a shuddering halt with a pedantic digression on the topic of History (with a capital H) and free will and military tactics and Napoleon's intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "These digressions do several things. First, and most importantly, they seriously disrupt the narrative. All rhythm and timing is thrown off, which is exactly what happened to all my school concerts when I used to play the snare drum. I knew enough to quit the snare drum to focus on the recorder. Tolstoy, though, plunges on obliviously, casting all notions of structure aside. You lose sight of the characters for hundreds of pages. Instead of wondering what happens next, you start to wonder things like and . It tells you something when you actually start to Pierre's endless internal psychobabbling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the essays are Tolstoy at his stupidest (at least in my opinion; this is more a philosophical gripe). He believes that people have no control; that History is a force all its own, and that we act according to History's push and pull. Tolstoy says, in effect, that Napoleon is stupid, but that his enemies were stupider, but that doesn't matter, because they were all doing what they had to do, because History made them. This is all very...much a waste of time. Tolstoy goes to far as to attempt to prove this argument algebraically. Yeah, that's just what I wanted: Math!\n",
      "\n",
      "Tolstoy's argument breaks down like this: 1. Someone does something. 2. Someone else reacts in a way that makes no sense. 3. Therefore, History is controlling things. The fundamental flaw, of course, is that Tolstoy's argument really boils down to nothing more than hindsight. Sitting in his armchair, decades after the fact, having never been on those battlefields, Tolstoy decides that the players on the scene acted dumbly, and he attributes that to cosmic events. A battle isn't lost because of bad roads, or obscured vision, or a shortage of ammunition (which are realities in all warfare, but even more prevalent in the 19th century). No, in Tolstoy's mind, it’s the Universe unfolding according to its whim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tolstoy also has a real axe to grind with Napoleon and he doesn’t hesitate to inflate his word count letting you know about it. (I suppose Tolstoy can be forgiven for hating Napoleon, but still, the book is 1,200 pages long. Enough). His analysis of the Corsican corporal is reductive and unenlightening. Napoleon was a lot of things (short, funny looking, brilliant, cruel, petty, brilliant, ambitious, oddly-shaped) but \"stupid\" was not among them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, there were moments when I loved this novel. Every once in awhile, comes alive in that classic way; after plodding through a turgid essay, you’ll suddenly come upon a passage that's drawn so vividly you will remember it forever. There is the battle of Austerlitz, which is impeccably researched (so much so that a narrative history I read on the subject actually cites to Tolstoy) and thrillingly told, especially the fight of Captain Tushin's battery. There is Prince Andrei, wounded on the field of Austerlitz, staring up at \"the infinite sky,\" realizing that he's never really looked at it before. There is Pierre, realizing he is in love with Natasha as he gazes at the stars and glimpses the comet of 1812. There is Napoleon suffering a cold on the eve of Borodino. There is Andrei watching a cannon ball land at his feet, its fuse hissing... There is Petya, the young adjutant, who rides to his doom chasing the French during their retreat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every once in awhile, there will also be something clever, showing you that Tolstoy isn't just wordy, but also inventive. For instance, there's a scene in which Tolstoy describes the thoughts of an old oak tree. Indeed! Among the hundreds of characters, there's even a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was also fond of a passage in which General Kutuzov, the Russian commander, holds a meeting in a peasant's house to discuss abandoning Moscow. Tolstoy tells this story from the point of view of a little peasant girl who, in her mind, calls Kutuzov \"grandfather.\" (It's cute, but Kutuzov was no kindly old man. He was an indifferent drunk. The night before Austerlitz, he allegedly engaged in a four-some with three of the \"comfort women\" he brought with him on campaigns. Unfortunately, despite writing 1,200 pages, Tolstoy doesn't find space to devote to this occurrence).\n",
      "\n",
      "The good, though, is surrounded by the bad or the boring. The flyleaf of the book said that Pierre, Natasha, and Andrei were three of the most dynamic characters in literature. I don't think so. Aside from Andrei, I was mostly unimpressed with the main characters (Napoleon was fun, in an over-the-top bit part). Pierre is a boob and a bore, and his sudden heroics during the burning of Moscow come from nowhere. Natasha is a flake. She's the stereotypical girl plucking the daisy: I love him; I love him not; I love him...\n",
      "\n",
      "The end of the novel is (like ) a huge anti-climatic letdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we approach the final pages, Tolstoy gives us a description of the battle of Borodino. It is a masterpiece of military fiction. The research and verisimilitude. The vividness. Pierre's confrontation with the Frenchman in the redoubt:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tolstoy’s Borodino is actually one of the great battle scenes I've ever read; afterwards, though, things fall of a cliff. There is no slow decline into mediocrity; no, it happens at the turn of the page. It’s like Tolstoy suddenly stopped taking steroids.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an unseemly rush, Tolstoy has Napoleon move into Moscow, Moscow burns, Napoleon retreats. All of this occurs indirectly, through digression-filled essays on History. The characters recede into the background; all narrative vitality disappears. There are only a couple exceptions: one scene of the city burning, followed by one (admittedly powerful) scene of the French executing supposed arsons. During the French retreat, there is not a single visceral moment depicting their hard, frozen march. Instead we get Tolstoy nattering on about Napoleon’s stupidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then come the Epilogues. When I reached them, I felt a bit like a cowboy in one of those old westerns who is riding across the desert and finds a well, except the well is dry and full of snakes and then an Indian shoots him with an arrow. We will never know the fates of the dozens of characters we've followed for the previous thousand pages. Tolstoy leaves their destinies to the imagination so that he can rant. It’s a stupefying literary decision, and reminded me of nothing so much as my Uncle Ed on Thanksgiving after five glasses of wine: You can't get him to shut up. Except at Thanksgiving, Uncle Ed usually passes out by the fourth quarter of the Cowboys game. Not Tolstoy. Not even death can quiet him.\n",
      "\n",
      "was an experience. There were times I envisioned myself reaching the end, spiking the book like a football, and then doing some sort of victory dance around the splayed pages. When I got there, though, I simply sighed, leaned back in my chair, and thought: At least this was better than .\n",

Readers, I carried him. All 1272 pages. Every day, across five boroughs and three states, for nearly two months....\n",
      "\n",
      "So the burning question on your mind is, \"Should risk misalignment and a redislocated shoulder in the interest of preserving a pristine edition that's inevitably going to get all banged up anyway, as I lug it across battlefields and through trenches, for what seems an eternity? Which is more important: the book's spine, or my own?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bookster, I am here to put an end to all this wondering! Here is what you must do: simply take a keen exacto knife (you might ask a helpful Cossack to sharpen it for you), and slice out the final \"Epilogue\" portion of this burdensome tome. You will do no damage to the book -- the epilogue's like an appendix (and hey, what the hell, cut that out too) -- as this part is not necessary, and in fact though it's only about 7% of the book, this portion is responsible for at least 63% of its weight. So slice that bitch out, and throw it away! Your vertebrae will thank you later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another advantage to getting rid of the Epilogue is that it will save you from having to read what is conceivably the most deadly dull and deflating ending to a vast and magnificently readable book, ever written. As a particularly exacting size queen, I demand that the glory of a huge novel's ending be proportional to its length. I feel this is only fair: I was loyal and patient, and devoted many hours to reading the author's story, and at the end I should be rewarded for my fortitude with a glorious finale. That's always been my philosophy, anyway. Apparently, though, it's not Tolstoy's.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Tolstoy's philosophy, you ask? In particular, what's his philosophy of ? Well, let me tell you! Or better, let tell you. Cause he will. Over and over. And then again. And then, in case you were interested and wanted to know more, let him REALLY tell you.... and keep telling you.... and tell you some more.... and some more.... no, let him get into it finally now, in great\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, Tolstoy's that perfect house guest who crashed on your couch for nearly two months and you're just thrilled as hell the whole time to have him visiting, because he's just such a smart and great and interesting and heartfelt guy. Oh, sure, sometimes he gets a bit dull and wonky with his policy ramblings, but that stuff's basically okay. And then yeah, he's got these about history that are fine, you guess, but it's a bit weird how he's always repeating them and focusing on the same points over and over, and he will corner your roommate's friend or a classmate you run into at the supermarket, or an old lady waiting for the bus, to explain yet again why he thinks Napoleon really isn't that great at ALL, yeah, that's odd, but basically Leo is just super, and you're thrilled to have him -- even for such an extended visit -- because he really is so brilliant and diverting and nearly truly worth his weight in gold.... You are sad to know he's going to leave, but then his plane is delayed and you're happy you'll have him there just one more night, but somehow that's the night that he suddenly decides to come back to your house, completely high on cocaine. Leo then proceeds to stay up for hours drinking all your expensive scotch and talking your EAR off about his goddamn PHILOSOPHY of HISTORY that you really just could not care LESS about, and he WILL not leave and let you go to bed, he keeps TALKING, and it's BORING, and apparently he thinks your catatonic stare signals rapt interest, because he just keeps on going, explaining, on and on -- He WILL NOT SHUT ! It is almost just like being physically tortured, by this guy who you'd thought was the best houseguest in the whole wide world. And so when Leo finally leaves again the next morning -- ragged and bleary and too dazed still to be properly sheepish -- you're not sorry to see him go, in fact you're very glad. And does one annoying night cancel out two months of the great times you had together? Of course it doesn't, and you remember him fondly, and tell anyone who asks how nice it was when he stayed. But the night does carry a special weight because it was the last, and when you remember dear Leo, your wonderful houseguest, your affection will not be totally untainted by the memory of his dull, egotistical, coked-out rantings, the night before he left for real.\n",
      "\n",
      "By which I mean to say, the rest of this book was totally great! As my Great Aunt Dot (who's read this twice) commented, \"It's really not a difficult read at all; there's a chapter about War, and then a chapter about Peace, so it never gets boring.\" is hugely entertaining, and largely readable. Plus, it's enormously educational, as you will be forced to learn more than you ever wanted to know about the great Napoleon! (According to Tolstoy, he wasn't that great. No, I mean really, he wasn't that great.) is a terrific date book, because it's got lots of bloody action and also tons of romance, plus you can make out during the dull parts where Tolstoy's talking for like twelve pages about various generals and strategies and his nineteenth-centuried out opinions about history.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there's a standard I value more highly than my long-book-great-ending demand, it's the one that I call \"Make Me Cry.\" I don't really think a book's that great unless it makes me cry. (No, this doesn't work in the other direction -- just because a book makes me cry doesn't mean it's great. I've cried at really silly movies before, and I used to cry regularly whenever I read the newspaper, which is one reason I stopped.) made me cry like a colicky baby that's been speared with a bayonet, THREE TIMES! I don't mean I misted up or got a little chokey -- I mean I sobbed, wept, and groaned, thoroughly broke down and lost my shit on a very cathartic and soul-rending level. Hooray! I can't guarantee that will also make you cry, but I bet if you're prone to that sort of thing, you've got a good shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOD this book is good. See, you should really skip the Epilogue, because besides being crushingly dull, it's also very depressing (in the wrong way), and in addition to making you vow never to marry could make you forget how GREAT and AMAZING the rest of this is. What a GREAT and AMAZING book! Holy shit! I'm flipping through now, and it's all coming back to me. This was totally of 1868: If you like serious character development and plotting that unfolds over a long period of time, you should seriously read this book. I really didn't know much about this book before I read it, but I think I remember someone -- Jane Smiley? -- writing that is about everything. I wouldn't go along with that (I'm not sure if she would either), but it is about most of the things that really matter. If you are someone who thinks at all about life or death, you might like this book. Here is a passage, from a character who's a POW marching barefoot through Russia in October:\n",

OMFG! all so different! -- and how much is the same. The nuance, specificity, and instant recognizability of the characters in here is pretty amazing. I know this sounds dumb, but you really feel like you know these people, and in a way it's the minor characters -- Sonya, Anatole, Dolokhov (my favorite!) -- who are so perfectly drawn, and make you go, \"Man! I these people! Woah!\"\n",

At the beginning I'd hoped that this would help me understand more about why wars happen, but it didn't.

      "I have a selective memory, I don’t know whether it comes as a blessing or as a curse, that enables me to remember the most insignificant details like for instance, where and when I bought my books, which are often second hand copies. When I pull one of them off my shelves it usually comes loaded with recollections of a certain moment of my life that add up to the mute history of their usually worn and yellow pages.\n",

      "That’s what meant to me until I finally shook my sloth off and decided to read it. It turns out I rather lived than read it, or maybe the book read me, but in any case, I curse my lazy self for not having taken the plunge much sooner.\n",

      "This book is an electroshock for the soul. There is no division between Tolstoy’s art and his philosophy, just as there is no way to separate fiction from discussions about history in this novel. Without a unifying theme, without so much a plot or a clear ending, is a challenge to the genre of the novel and to narrative in history. Tolstoy groped toward a different truth- one that would capture the totality of history, as it was experienced, and teach people how to live with its burden.\n",
      ", , These are existential questions on the meaning of life that restlessly impregnate this “novel”, which also deals with the responsibility of the individual, who has to strive against the dichotomy of free will as opposed to the influence of the external world, in the course of history. Fictional and historical characters blend naturally in the narration, which occasionally turns into a reasoned philosophical digression, exploring the way individual lives affect the progress of history, challenging the nature of truth accepted by modern historians.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tostoy’s syntax is unconventional. He frequently ignores the rules of grammar and word order, deliberately reiterating mannerisms or physical details to identify his characters, suggesting their moral qualities. He uses several languages gradually changing their sense, especially with French, which eventually emerges as the language of artifice and insincerity, the language of the theater and deceit whereas Russian appears as the language of honesty and seriousness and the reader becomes a privileged witness of the formation of a community and national consciousness.\n",
      "In repeating words and phrases, a rhythm and rhetorical effect is achieved, strengthening the philosophical pondering of the characters. I was emotionally enraptured by the scene in which Count Bezukhov asks himself what’s the meaning of love when he glances at the smiling face of Natasha or when Prince Andrey lies wounded in Austerlitz battlefield looking up at the endless firmament, welcoming the mystery of death and mourning for his hapless and already fading life. The book is full of memorable scenes which will remain imprinted in my retina, eternal flashing images transfixing me quite: the beauty of Natasha’s uncovered shoulders emerging from her golden dress, the glow of bonfires lit by kid-soldiers in the night before a battle, the agony of men taken prisoners and the absent faces of circumstantial executioners while shooting their fellowmen, the unbearable pain of a mother when she learns of her son’s death, a silent declaration of love in a dancing embrace full of youth and promise…\n",

      "is much more than a novel. It is a vast, detailed account - maybe even a sort of diary or a confession- of a world about to explode in constant contradiction where two ways of being coexist: war and peace. Peace understood not only as the absence of war, but mainly as the so much coveted state in which the individual gets hold of the key to his identity and happiness, achieving harmonious communion with others along the way.\n",
      "Now that I have finally read this masterpiece, I think I can better grasp what this “novel” represents among all the great works of art created by men throughout our venturesome existence: the Sistine Chapel or the 9th Symphony of Literature, an absolute triumph of the creative mind, of the spirit of humankind and a virtuous affirmation of human life in all its richness and complexity.\n",

      "My battered copy of and I have fought many battles together, hand in hand. We have been gently soaked by the descent of moist beads in the misty drizzle at dawn in Paracas. We have been splashed by the salty waves of the Pacific Ocean only to be dried off later by the sandy wind blowing from the dunes of the Huacachina Desert. We have been blessed by the limpid droplets dripping down from branches of Eucalyptus Trees in the Sacred Valley of the Incas and scorched by the blinding sunbeams in Nazca.\n",
      "Particles of ourselves were left behind, dissolved into the damp shroud of grey mist falling from the melting sky in MachuPicchu, and whatever remained of us tried to breathe in deeply the fragrant air of those dark, warm nights spent under scintillating stars scattered endlessly down the Peruvian sky.\n",

      "With wrinkled pages, tattered covers and unglued spine, my copy of has managed to come back home. I have just put it back reverently on my bookshelf for literary gems, where I can spot it at first glance. An unbreakable connection has been established between us as fellow travellers, as wanderers of the world. Somehow, we have threaded our own unique history; an unrepeatable path has been laid down for us. The story of this particular shabby copy comes to an end though, because I won’t ever part from it. My copy of has come back home, where I intent to keep it, now for good. No more war for these battered pages but everlasting peace emanating from my shelves for all times to come.\n",

Sorry, got confused there for a minute with Lord of the Rings, another 1,000+ page work where there are love affairs, war and an eventual peace. (That's hardly a spoiler by the way. Not unless you've been hiding under a rock and don't know that Napoleon didn't succeed in conquering Russia.) Which is my point: With every half-penny fantasy potboiler these days weighing in at several hundred of war and peace (*cough*Wheel of Time*cough*), how can we still look at a book this size and feel fear? 1,000+ pages? Only? Pshaw! That's nuthin!. Spit out t'baccy chaw.\n",

      "The thing is, to my surprise, I found it a rollicking good read. There are star-crossed lovers, suicide attempts, heart-rending death bed scenes, and battles aplenty where our heroes get knocked on the head and taken prisoner. Instead of Middle Earth, you get a fantasy-land of wholesome, loving Peasant Russia and you learn how True Self comes from Loving the Russian Soil. Okay, there's also the rather irritating and interminable philosophizing by Tolstoy about History and Its Causes, but you got through the interminable side songs in didn't you?\n",

      "In case any of you are thinking that I'm mocking by this comparison, please note that it's not intended to be (wholly) facetious. I .

But the good thing about him was that he totally redeemed himself as the story progresses.Although, I would say that he what he did with the entire thing is a bit unrealistic. He's just a high school kid being hunted down by the FBI and those other bad guys. He could only do so much, right? I mean I believe the hacker things. I believe that a high school kid could possibly hack a high security website, but to keep himself out of danger when the people who he is up against has lots of controls to anything he has access on? It would have been slighly more believable if he was a secret agent or something and not a high school kid. Hehe.\n",

      "“The Silence of Six” is an exciting page turner that begs you not to put it down until you know how it all will end. Built around the world of computer hacking, compromised security, and government overstepping its bounds, in this day and age it could almost be described as a horror story. I know it has left me a bit on the paranoid side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The characters are well-developed, the plot picks up its quick pace from the very beginning, and the plot is unpredictable, which is exactly how any good thriller should be. The hacker world is also rather extensively explored, which can be both a good and a bad thing. For those with computer knowledge, it adds to the fun. For those who are able to gloss over details they do not understand and go with the flow, it does not take away from the excitement. However, for those who can get lost in details, it may be overwhelming. It is for that reason that I would not recommend “The Silence of Six” for reluctant school-aged readers.\n",

It somehow frightened me too for several reasons.\n",

And that the cyberworld has its pros and cons so be aware of what you posting or doing online. Think before you click as they say.\n",

      "“Education, far from giving people the confidence in their ability and capacities to overcome obstacles or to become masters of the laws governing external nature as human beings, tends to make them feel their inadequacies, their weaknesses and their incapacities in the face of reality; and their inability to do anything about the conditions governing their lives.”- Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Decolonising the Mind\n",

      "I’ve never seen colonialism described as succinctly as in the following passage:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I read this book with my experiences in Africa, conversations with my relatives and friends, and my education at the back of my mind. Trying to make sense of history and my place in it made this book invaluable to me, and helped clarify and reiterate a lot of things. The more I read books on Africa, be they about art, language, history, or politics, the more I’m amazed how the continent is seen, in many people’s minds, as a homogeneous country. This passive thinking really masks the complexity of issues in the continent. Even without colonialism Africa would have been quite intricate but colonialism has truly caused mayhem in the entire continent. And in many ways, language is one of the biggest weapons the colonialists used to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like wa Thiong’o a lot. Not only is he a great writer, but it’s also clear he is a very passionate person with a lot of love for his country, his continent and his language, and a great advocate for the traditional arts. He is very blunt and I admire that a lot. Nobody is safe from his criticism, even a few of my personal favourites such as Achebe, Soyinka, Cesaire. In a sense he thinks they were brainwashed for putting the language of the colonizers on a pedestal. I think it’s an interesting argument to be had but it’s hard for me to pick a side because I’m admittedly colonized myself and English-dominant, although it’s not my first language. I found it useful to read wa Thiong’o’s perspective regardless.\n",
      "\n",
      "And wa Thiongo’s perspective is important. He grew up during colonialism after all, so he, unlike me, had the opportunity to study in his native language and unfortunately had to endure being forced to assimilate into the English language.He details how the British tried to suppress local languages in Kenya, how they arrested those who tried to encourage cultural proliferation, and controlled the gathering of people in places. He sees the differences in himself and his society before and after English language education was forced on him, and his explanations and insights are very precise and often personal.\n",
      "\n",
      "wa Thiong’o is very thorough in how he discusses the role of language as a carrier and transmitter of culture, and what happens when that language is taken away from people. This is such a common story, not just in Africa but even here in Canada, and I think we’re beginning to understand just how damaging it is to suppress and devalue language. In what planet does it make sense that a Kenyan student in colonial Kenya would be punished for speaking Gikuyu or Swahili instead of English? Personally I remember how I was often treated better than my cousins just because I could speak English and they couldn’t; I learned early on how language can be elitist:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another great thing about wa Thing’o is how he respects the peasantry (his choice of word). The other day I was reading about the Third Estate in France during the 19th Century revolution and this reminded me of how in Africa the peasantry are the majority, and that’s where the culture comes from. Who makes the oral stories, who upholds the culture? It’s nice to see the peasantry being accredited with maintaining culture and tradition:\n",

      "\n",
      "I was struck by the violence caused by colonialism. Colonialism was celebrated, and that’s the world I grew up in: gratitude to the colonialists for “rescuing” us. But what we know now is that it was very very violent and the wounds are still there. If, like wa Thiong’o said, in 1984 the president of the West German Federal Council visited Togo in order to celebrate the centennial of Germany establishing Togo as a German colony, \"to commemorate not the resistance to colonisation but the glory of colonisation,” then clearly we haven’t learned much and dialogue still needs to be had.\n",
      "\n",
      "The constant unlearning, the decolonizing, that needs to be done because we were lied to, is something that I thought of throughout this book. And it’s only now that I’m realizing in more detail just how horrific colonialism was, just how much we’ve lost. What I aim to do myself, how I aim to decolonize my own mind, is by reading more of my history. I’ve also been thinking about how I’ve been influenced by other cultures so I wonder how far I can be decolonized. This got me thinking about globalization and how that has affected us, I would be interested to hear Thiong’o’s thoughts on this. This is definitely a must-read for everyone, there is so much we don’t know or realize about the impact of the actions of those who came before us, and this is a great start.\n",

      "Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o had already published four acclaimed novels in English when, in 1977, he gave up the language as a vehicle for fiction. A few years later he published this polemic, which he said would be his last writing in English in any genre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, he's now probably even more famous among sociolinguists than students of literature, because Decolonising the Mind is a rare example of a top practitioner setting out a total rationale, complete with backstory and running examples, of the political and cultural implications of choosing one language over another.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be possible to argue on purely artistic grounds that a local language is simply better at describing certain things – the rhythms of daily life, say, or regional wildlife – than another. But what makes Ngũgĩ's argument so powerful is that his grounds are not artistic, but political. Writing in Kikuyu may give him access to new and interesting aesthetic effects, but that's not why he does it – he does it to resist cultural appropriation and to target a more primary audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's always been a big irony in literature from former colonies that uses a colonial language – what Ngũgĩ calls ‘Afro-European’ literature, a useful term that I'm happy to adopt. Abroad, it's often praised in proportion to how well it shows us the details of different, alien lives, and yet it's obviously aimed at us, not them: the people described are often exactly those excluded from reading it. Chinua Achebe's descriptions of yam farmers in Nigeria will rarely be read by yam farmers in Nigeria, because most of them can't read English.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ngũgĩ had a crisis about this after writing his third novel, (still the only one of his that I've so far read).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There's an obvious answer, of course, which is that people write in order to communicate ideas, and writing in a major world language communicates your ideas more widely than doing so in a small regional language. Six or seven million people speak Kikuyu, whereas four hundred million speak English natively and probably almost as many again as a second language. The implications of this are not just remunerative – though that's no small consideration – they're also practical, if you're interested in influencing bigger audiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, for Ngũgĩ this is an argument for having a better translation culture, not for the abandonment of a writer's native language. The attempt to wrangle African languages into English has been invigorating and transformative for English – one thinks of Amos Tutuola or Ben Okri – but, at the end of the day, why the hell should we be benefitting at the expense of other languages? ‘We cannot have our cake and eat it,’ he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a fair point. For Ngũgĩ, there's little difference between a postcolonial English enriching itself from African languages, and a colonial England enriching itself from African labour or resources. The problem is circular, because the lack of literatures in many smaller languages leads to an assumption, even from native speakers, that they are unable to support a literature, let alone a world literature. But if addressing that misconception is not the job of writers, whose job is it?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As an English-speaker, one reads this book with, first of all, a renewed sense of gratitude that so many writers have in fact chosen to write in English, along with a troubling re-evaluation of why they felt it was necessary to do so. At the very least everyone should agree that more translated fiction should be out there, and not just coming from the major languages. Ngũgĩ is one of the few big writers putting his money where his mouth is by writing only in his native tongue, but even he's had to make concessions: his major work, (), was translated into English by Ngũgĩ himself, so he did actually write the text of the English novel that everyone's reading. If that's not having your cake and eating it, I'm not sure what is.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Decolonising the Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature had been on my radar for a long time. It is among the most important texts of the postcolonial canon, and one of the most iconic essays written by an African writer ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, I fell in love with its author – Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o – through my reading of his magnum opus Wizard of the Crow. Ngũgĩ’s distinctive writing style, the rich narrative, its urgent message, and, of course, the fact that he wrote this 800-page novel in Gikuyu, his native language, as opposed to English. When he embarked on that project in the early 2000s, he had been writing his fictional works in Gikuyu since 1978. He was amongst the first African writers to honour his native language in that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, the Kenyan author is one of the most important voices of literature from Africa. Time and again, he has been considered a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature [and one day, he’ll get it … JUST YOU WAAAAIT]. , published in 1986, is probably his most influential essay. Nonetheless, it took over 30 years for it to be translated into German.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, the German translation of his essay closes a circle. For it was here in Germany that he began working on it. Ngũgĩ lived for a short time in Bayreuth in 1984, where he taught at the university as a visiting professor. After that, he was to give a series of lectures at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. He was allowed to choose the topic freely, but had his difficulties with it, as he recalls: \"I had to give these four connected lectures, and I couldn't think of anything. But in the silence of Bayreuth, the first lecture, which later became 'Decolonizing the Mind,' took shape in my mind. That's why the connection to Germany is very important to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In this new German edition, Ngũgĩ’s essays are supplemented by current contributions from African authors and scholars who deal with the significance that Ngũgĩ's theses have attained in their homelands: Boubacar Boris Diop (Senegal), Achille Mbembe (Cameroon), Petina Gappah (Zimbabwe), Sonwabiso Ngcowa (South Africa), and Mukoma wa Ngũgĩ (Kenya). For this additional essays alone, it is worthwhile to check out the German translation over the English original.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In this essay, Ngũgĩ shows how imperialism lived on, not only in the minds of the African people but also in the core structures of the many African states that were officially declared independent from former European colonial powers. These lingering “metaphysical empires”, whether English, French or Portuguese, ensured the continued oppression of Africans through the degradation of their native languages.\n",
      "For decades, African children were, and in some states still are, punished and shamed in school for using their mother tongue. No longer by the British, French, Belgian or Portuguese occupiers, but by native teachers. Who, in turn, implement the directives of their respective governments. The attitude that African languages are inferior has been completely internalized by these successors of the former rulers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The colonial brainwashing was thus exceedingly successful and persistent in its effects, Ngũgĩ remembers: \"When I first used this term [decolonizing the mind], I reaped some opposition, even hostility from African intellectuals. Some of them judged my argument in favor of African languages as a kind of reversion to the past, even a 'retreat into the wilderness.' One could not give up English or the other European languages. , but that we have to find our roots again in the African languages. And that only African intellectuals can develop their own language, nobody else can do that for us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And Ngũgĩ wasn't just about talk, he was all about action. Since 1978, he has written all of his novels in Gikuyu. Since 1984, he continued with also writing most of his nonfiction in Gikuyu as well. He then translates everything into English himself, to make his texts available for a broader and international audience as well ... but his priorities lie with his own people. He wants to write for his people, many of which (especially of the older generation, like his mother and grandmother) aren't capable of reading in the colonial language and are therefore excluded from this cultural goods. By writing in Gikuyu, he makes literature accessible for them. And Ngũgĩ's endeavors prove successful: his novels in Gikuyu, published by local publishing houses, are bestsellers in his home country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ngũgĩ advocates for African literature to be actually written in African languages. What seems to be the most normal thing for almost any other part of the world (...of course German literature is written in German, and not in Xhosa), is subject for discourse and opposition when it comes to African literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the tradition of Chinua Achebe, Africa's most influential writer up to this day, the Western world has defined African literature as one being written in either English, French or Portuguese. Those are the writers and texts that are being perceived as literary worthy, those are the books that get published – mainly by Western publishing houses, for Western audiences. It's a paradox that is as frustrating as it is infuriating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Language is so much more than just language. It transports myths, ways of thinking, it is the carrier of the culture and mentality of the people who speak it and are anchored it in. To strip someone of their language is a horrible thing. And although things have changed and the idea of decolonization has spread, literature being written in African languages is still the exception rather than the rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Like I mentioned before, six different African writers were invited to share their thoughts on Ngũgĩ's essay for its German translation. Petinah Gappah from Zimbabwe, for example, describes how she lost her mother tongue, Shona, at school. Today, Gappah translates European literature into Shona, such as George Orwell's , as she has rediscovered the worth and value of her mother tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonwabiso Ngcowa from South Africa reports that his neighbors in the township are proud of him as a writer but take issue with the fact that he is writing in English, they demand texts in Xhosa from him. That's a significant shift, as it illustrates how the sense of self-worth and appreciation of their culture has grown over the past decades. African people want to read African literature, written by them, for them. Boubacar Boris Diop also tells of progress, since the number of educational institutions in Senegal that offer studies in Wolof, not just French, has increased over the past decades as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of these authors, however, continue to write and publish not in their native languages but in the colonial ones. Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o's son Mukoma wa Ngũgĩ, best known in Germany for his Nairobi crime novels, is no exception: As a professor at Cornell University on the U.S. East Coast, he promotes literature in Kiswahili but writes in English himself, as do his four siblings. His father doesn't blame anyone for that:\n",
      "It is hard enough to publish books as it is. Ngũgĩ knows that if you're an aspiring writer (who isn't famous like himself) who wants to publish in Gikuyu, you won't find a publisher. Your book will disappear in a drawer for a long time, but if you write in English or French the likelihood of being published within a years increases tenfold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, Ngũgĩ concludes sadly: \"Whoever writes in English or French gets immediate attention. Whoever writes in an African language remains invisible.\" In order to change that, we need a system change, many of the persistent colonial structures, not just within the publishing industry, but also the educational system and the government, need to be uprooted. It will be a long way, a hard struggle, but a necessary one. I salute every African writer who takes up this task!\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "In this work Ngugi wa Thiong'o bids farewell to his practice of writing in English, adding that he hopes translation will enable him to continue to communicate with all. He then explains the passionate reasoning behind his belief in the use of African languages by African writers.\n",
      "I have come to realise more and more that work, any work, even literary creative work, is not the result of an individual genius but the result of a collective effort\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking as a founding principle that imperialism and its internal allies will never develop Africa, he critiques the notion that tribal conflict is the source of discord in Kenya and across the continent (invariables like biological nationality cannot be the true source of conflict, which would be eternal and unchanging if that were the case, he says). Rather, the divide and rule practices of colonialism are at the root of such conflict. He identifies two traditions of thought in Kenya: the imperialist tradition of the international bourgeoisie and 'flag waving native ruling classes' and subjugation of the people enforced by police boots, barbed wire, clergy & judiciary, supported by state intellectuals AND the resistance tradition of the working people/peasantry and 'patriotic' petty-bougeoisie/middle class including students and intellectuals, supporting all nationalities in the area against imperialist domination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imperialism is the monopolistic and parasitic rule of consolidated finance capital. The freedom for Western finance capital to go on stealing from the working people of the global south is maintained by conventional and nuclear weapons, but more importantly by 'the cultural bomb' that annihilates the self belief and solidarity of the people. Ngugi wa Thiong'o explains that language allows us to define ourselves in relation to our national and social environment:\n",
      "\n",
      "He describes his experience of learning-through-storytelling alongside everyday communication and shared experience in his mother tongue, Gikuyu, and how the harmony of his learning life was broken in colonial schools, where speaking Gikuyu was punished while all achievement in English was rewarded and prioritised. Native languages are associated by colonial education with low status, humiliation, corporal punishment, stupidity and barbarism. For the African child in this context, thought itself takes the visible form of a foreign language, and thus she feels disassociated from her natural and social environment. Ngugi wa Thiong'o explains that culture is transmitted not through language in universality but in its particularity of a specific social/historical context. The way English is used in African countries is not the same as the way it is used in Scandinavian countries as a tool of communication, but as an instrument of control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Literature written by Africans in European languages by anti-imperial petty bourgeois authors articulated resistance to racist European colonisation and drew on African cultures and histories to give that class self-confidence. This work armed uprisings inspired by political awakening and drew stamina and substance from proverbs and fables of the peasantry, helping struggles for independence. But, as neo-colonial/pro-imperial governments gained power this literature became disiullsioned and cynical. Its authors wanted to communicate with a working class/peasant (WC/P) audience but they were hampered by their use of Euro languages. They created WC/P characters who spoke English and projected their own evasive self-contemplation, existential anguish and crises of identity onto them, falsifying historical processes and realities.\n",
      "\n",
      "While African authors were worrying about a crisis of identity in African literature and accepting (with some exceptions) the 'fatalistic logic' of linguistic Europeanization of African cultural output, the very neo-col rulers they were haranguing in their books were busy issuing 'distortions, dictatorial directives, museum-type fossils paraded as African culture, feudalistic ideology, superstitions and lies' in the languages of the WC/P! So the result of colonial education, as intended, is to cut off communication between petty-bourgeois intellectuals and their intended audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ngugi wa Thiong'o delineates a minor tradition (praising its great talents such as Achebe, Armah etc and works) of Afro-European literature, which he says will last as long as neo-colonial rule. Since writing in Gikuyu he has been asked why he chose to do so by all kinds of people. Some academics have asked 'why have you abandoned us?' But Gikuyu is his mother tongue! This reversal of common sense relates directly to other upside-down (thanks ) logics of imperialism:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the section on African theatre. Colonialism pretends there is no tradition of African theatre, but is it has a long and deep heritage in Kenya, where it was destroyed by the British (any free public gathering is dangeous to authoritarian domination). Part of this tradition was the concept of 'empty space' among the people where theatre took place. Colonialism attempted to destroy this by confining that space in community halls, proscenium theatres and even in prisons and detainment camps where inmates were encouraged to produce neo-colonial and anti- Mau-Mau propaganda plays. Radio drama was also encouraged in which the African as clown was ridiculed: laugh at your own stupidity and simplicity, forget about all this freedom nonsense!\n",
      "\n",
      "Anti-imperial petty-bourgeois writers tried to break from colonial control by taking control of the Kenyan National Theatre, touring productions of anti-colonial plays, but these were often hampered by the use of English and confinement within walls - this approach brings culture to the people rather than involving them in its creation. By contrast, his production of in Kamiriithu was defined and shaped by the decision to use Gikuyu, which forced a discussion with the peasants and factory workers about the use of language and about the language of theatre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfection of an art form as a process with a shared history is, Nguigi wa Thiong'o points out, in opposition to the conventional secrecy of rehearsals culminating in a presentation intended to cause amazement and a sense of 'wow, I couldn't do that'. This approach is in keeping with alienating bourgeois education which is a process of weakening people, making them feel incapable, mystifying knowledge. It produces 'a gallery of active stars and an undifferentiated mass of grateful admirers'. Those involved in the Kamiriithu project talked about how it made them feel valuable and integral, how it raised their awareness. The play's license was withdrawn and its writer incarcerated...\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example of the upside down logic of imperialism and capitalism generally is the possibility of development it offers and then makes impossible . The arrival of the printing press in Kenya was accompanied by the familiar rhetoric of spreading education and culture and dispelling African awe of nature and superstition, but with heavy censorship and careful selection it really pushed a message of subserviance via Christianity, and increased awe of the whip/gun-wielding master. Writing novels in a neo-colonial context meets several obstacles, one of which is that reality is often beyond satire in its grim absurdity. Another is the lack of libraries and book shops in rural areas and the corresponding excuse 'the people are poor and illiterate so they don't need libraries and bookshops'. Yet Ngugi's first book in Gikuyu sold; it was read by literate community members aloud at gatherings, in bars, it was embraced. Build it and they will come...\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally Ngugi wa Thiong'o addresses the question of relevance and the creation of appropriate education programs. He argues that orature, rooted in WC/P sources of anti-imperial resistance should be centred in Kenyan schooling. Historically, he points out, the great Western humanist authors like Shakespeare, Austen etc who provide incisive comment on bourgeois culture have been treated as if the only themes they dealt with were universal love, fear, birth, death etc. Western education, in my experience, has the same imbalance, universalising and depoliticising the personal, diminishing the particularity of history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many African writers have expressed concern to enrich Western literature by making African wisdom accessible and translatable - Ngugi asks why they do not centre the African tradition and seek to enrich that with riches from foreign cultures. He comments on the commitment fellow Kenyan authors expressed (in an advocacy document) not to replace English chavinism with national chauvinism, centring Kenyan orature and literature but including all African and diasporic writing, speaking of the need to introduce the Kenyan child to the world context of black experience. Latin American and Asian literatures would also be studied, with Euro-American not excluded but perhaps lowest in priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved reading this and agreed with it strongly, but I would like to write a few words in defence of contemporary African authors like Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie who write in English. I want to humbly suggest that the paths to decolonisation may be as many and various as the people in need of it (noting that the distinction between coloniser and colonised is blurred, not least by class conditions) and that the uses of literature are also many and various (noting that the distinction between creator and audience is blurred). Perhaps my colonisation and indoctrination into individualism is speaking, but it seems plausible that Ngugi's Marxist conception of literature has some limitations? I look forward to reading more about this subject and how thought in the area has developed.\n",

      "One of the larger background questions of Pern novels in the last decade is \"Are there more stories to tell on Pern?\" After 'All the Weyrs of Pern', it seemed unlikely, but then stories in and around the ninth pass continued to prove that that was still a rich area for the new stories, and even 'Red Star Rising' proved that going back into history could also work, but in general the third pass stuff hasn't worked.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of the basic background of the stories: plagues and the time travelling, have felt rehased from other books. Moreta dealt with plague, and that was a great book, and she was a great, strong character. And Lessa's timing it was more believable, and more of a character achievement. And Lessa was a strong, impressive character. By comparison Fiona and Xhinna aren't as well written characters, I don't like or care about them as much other Pernese figures, and their achievments are likewise less impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was looking forward to 'After the Fall is Over' for a while now, and maybe if something does come out, I might read it - but I will pass on anything else which comes out from Pern now. I'll just try and remember the better stories.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I think that Goodreads should give you a negative option when rating books- minus one star would be perfect for this book. Todd McCaffrey has completely ruined Pern. I am a huge fan of Anne McCaffrey's Pern books, but Todd needs to put this pass out of its misery and go do something else. One indicator for me that a book will be bad is when it is a new book in a popular series with a huge following, and the book is actually sitting on the shelf at the library, instead of on hold for three months. Sky Dragons was on the shelf. I suppose that is the only redeeming quality here- I did not have to pay to be tortured.\n",
      "\n",
      "So many things are wrong with this book, it is nearly impossible to know where to begin. The first problem is that there are too many characters, and it's impossible to keep track of who they are, what they do, and where they go. It's also impossible to feel any connection to any of the characters- Xhinna was on my nerves after the first page- and there was zero character development. Of course the main problem with this entire Pass that Todd has created is that there is nothing new. Plague? Moreta did that. Go back in time while risking life and dragon to save Pern? Lessa did that. Impress a dragon you're not supposed to Impress? Jaxom did that. Evil Lord Holder starving his dependents and neglecting his duties as Lord Holder? Chalkin did that to Bitra in Dragonseye. Female character acting out of \"tradition\"? Menolly did that, and she was much more awesome than Xhinna. All Todd has done is taken all the elements from the real Pern and mixed them up, given them new names, and created some weird alt-Pern with characters the reader never bonds with and ends up not caring about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enough. Don't bother. If you feel the need to live in Pern's world for awhile, go find one of the real Pern books, the ones with Lessa, F'lar, Robinton, Menolly, and Jaxom. Let this one go.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I'm not sure what to say. This was another book in what seemed a long series of books about the same characters and time span. There was a dragon sickness, thread fall was coming and they needed to save the dragons. There were several books dedicated to timing it to the past to have hatchings and raise hatchlings so that they would have more dragons during the time they needed it. This was another of those. Then they learned to fight thread really high where there isn't much oxygen. That was great until they ran out of oxygen. Again, the characters were okay and the story was just okay. To me, this whole bunch of books was just a bit too much. They just drew this time out way too much and the characters as well. I'm ready to move on and thankfully that was the last in that series of long drawn out story.\n",

      "This is a tale of dragons from Pern, the home of Anne McCaffrey’s dragonesque imagination. Plague has decimated the dragons of Pern and their riders to the point where there is an insufficient defense against Thread. This book details how a small band of courageous dragon riders preservers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know if I own every book that Anne McCaffrey authored but if I don’t it isn’t for lack of trying. I am a major dragon fan and some of my all time favorite dragon tales are from Pern. This book was apparently co-authored with Anne’s son Todd. It gives a glimmer of hope that the wonderful tales won’t cease with the sad demise of the towering Anne McCaffrey. The flavor was most definitely Pernese and was totally satisfying.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interaction between dragon riders, dragons and folks in general has always been the strength of the Pern books. Sure the dragons and the exotic setting with the abundant action are a factor but the love and loyalty of the protagonists are the spine of the book.\n",

      "Mathieu was plucked from the battlefield 800 years before by a beautiful and cruel demon, forced into bondage, and filled with demonic knowledge. Long years after, his torturous bonds dissolved and his future uncertain, he must decide whether to risk his freedom to help another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Irene Ferris' debut novel is about choices and costs. Mathieu navigates his own culpability in helping his demon (albeit as an unwilling slave), and debates whether his trauma will prevent him from living like a human in the future. Human beings navigate moral choices ranging from the evils of selfish tunnel vision to the seductive call of doing the wrong thing for all the right reasons.\n",

      "hooked me with a great premise: medieval nun assassins who serve Saint Mortain, the god of death. The novel is set in an alternate realm of Brittany, where the local gods have been subsumed by Christianity and renamed saints. The old ways live on, however, especially among the daughters of Saint Mortain, who serve as the realm's assassins, killing those who need to be killed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our lethal heroine, Ismae, escapes a life of poverty and abuse by joining the convent. Soon she is plunged into a game of intrigue and villainy as the realm tries to maintain its independence from France. Unfortunately for Ismae, one of the people she is sent to spy on (and possibly assassinate) is the first man she feels she might love.\n",
      "\n",
      "The novel is driven by mystery, romance and subtle skulduggery. It isn't exactly an adventure novel, so don't expect a fight on every page, but if you stick with it, it's well worth reading! I'd recommend it to YA fans, especially those with an interest in history. The closest parallel I can think of is Cashore's Graceling -- another fantastic romance about a deadly heroine.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "2.5\n",
      "This book is like small dashes of awesomeness randomly sprinkled throughout long stretches of boredom. Perhaps I would have been far less bored if I cared more for fantasy/historical fiction that focuses most of its energy on the romance story. Perhaps I would have been less bored if the romance had been the kind to creep up on you, so that you're inwardly pleading that the characters will get together long before they even acknowledge their attraction for one another. Perhaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the romance was the main player in this book and it was the kind that sprang up immediately and left our heroine instantly breathless every time she saw Mr Duval after their first meeting. I prefer a book that is about more than a bit of romancing, but I'm not immune to a well-told love story either and I can easily be persuaded to award a book at least three stars if I'd been sold on it. Unfortunately, I wasn't. It all happened too soon, too predictably, too obviously. The heroine - Ismae - is a trained assassin that has some serious man issues (with understandable reason), so why can she do nothing but ogle Duval's sexy body in armour when they are in life-threatening situations?\n",
      "\n",
      "The beginning, in my opinion, was the best part of the whole book. A young woman has been scarred since her mother attempted to abort her pregnancy but she survived, and the marque she bears is that of Death's servants. She is rescued away from the beginning of an abusive marriage to be taken to a convent... but these are no ordinary nuns. She is trained as an assassin, taught how to fight, how to create complicated poisons to kill instantly or drag out a death for days. She is the ultimate weapon and she uses her abilities to serve the convent and Death.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot deny that this is a wonderful, kickass idea. The problem was that this part at the beginning is the most action-packed of the entire novel. After this, Ismae doesn't use her abilities that much beyond flashing her \"womanly charms\" at the men of court in order to find out information about who Brittany can really trust in these dangerous times when France is out for everything she can get. This book needed a serious injection of badassery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The politics surrounding the issues of Brittany and France in the 1400s could have been much more interesting than it was, except for the fact that it was used as a platform for Ismae and Duval's budding romance. There was too much talking and eaves-dropping on conversations that didn't matter, too much family drama with characters I couldn't give a damn about, too much of all the wrong stuff. Not enough conspiracies, plotting, (she is an assassin, for pity's sake, was it too much to expect a little more of it?).\n",
      "\n",
      "As much as I like this idea and part of me would like to know how this series progresses, I cannot imagine wanting to put myself through another 500 pages of boredom to find out. And one last thing, I'm sure some of the phrases used in this book weren't around one hundred years ago, never mind six hundred years ago... can't say for sure, I'm no language expert, but it sounded very 20th/21st century for me.\n",

      "Actual rating 2.5 stars\n",
      "\n",
      "Grave Mercy started out very strong for me with its historical roots. I instantly loved Ismae and could empathize with her bleak outlook on life. The novel had strong characters, a good plot, and political intrigue. I mean, c'mon! An assassin nun?! A badass premise like that is just begging to be read and loved. So what in heaven's name went wrong for me? Why am I only giving this book 2.5 stars?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I'll start with what I actually liked first. I did like all the characters, especially Ismae. It's a big deal for me to like the heroine since I usually hate them due to their inability to use their brains. But not Ismae, she's a smart cookie. This isn't shocking since I'd wager it does require a certain amount of neurons to assassinate someone. And while she does carry prejudices against men due to her harsh childhood, there is a good amount of character growth for her. So, gold star for her. Duval, the love interest, while initially not appealing to my co-blogger, won me over fairly easily. And for all those wondering, the \"His\" in \"His Fair Assassin\" is not referring to Duval. It refers to Ismae's god, Mortain. At least, I'm pretty sure. Lol.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also really liked the plot and the historic features. I can tell LaFevers did lot of research and it truly does show. Many of the characters in the novel are real people and the events occurring, real events. I felt it was a nice change in pace to the usual YA books I've read.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the good points just weren't enough for me to love this book. Unfortunately, the negatives outweigh the positives. *sigh* Another book falls short of badassery.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, I probably would never have picked up this book on my own if Kennedy hadn't suggested a read-a-long. I choose to avoid historic fiction for a myriad of reasons, the most important being: It's just not my cup of tea. When I have to sit down and think about the setting, time period, a huge cast of characters I have to keep up with, political talk, yada, yada, yada... it just turns me right off. It's too much. And I don't like having to concentrate while reading for enjoyment. In this case, I liked it, but then, I didn't like it. For the first portion of the novel, I was unsure of *when* in history this book took place. Personally, I cannot sit back and enjoy a novel if it feels like I'm missing a crucial part of the story. And the time period was important for me. European history is just not my forte, so I took to Wikipedia looking for answers. Unfortunately for me, I now knew how the story would eventually end unless Levers decided to deviate from history. But at least I knew the time period is the late 1480s. Yay for me. Boo that I had to work so hard to find the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, that was the first strike. The second? Boredom. Right around 40% the high from the strong beginning began to fade and along with it, my eyelids closed more often then I'd like them too. Ismae is a trained killer, but there wasn't much killing going on. In fact, there was mostly too much talking about the political plans being made to ward of the French from invasion. Honestly, I couldn't care less about any of that. I WANTED BLOOD. Then it got boring. Ismae spent more time talking about all her cool weapons, than using them. She'd go on and on about her poisons and how she could kill someone with this weapon or that poison. I wanted her to take a page from Nike.\n",

      "But, I was still interested enough to continue on and I'm glad I did, because it started getting interesting. However, that leads me to my forth point...\n",
      "\n",
      "This book was entirely too predictable. Could the bad guy be anymore obvious? LaFevers pretty much dangled him in front of us the entire novel like a carrot, so by the time the main characters goes, \"It was you!\" you're thinking, \"It's about time.\" And that really made me sad because I thought, \"There was no way it can be who I think it is. It's just too easy. There has to be one last plot twist.\" Sadly, there wasn't one and because of that, I think the ending suffered greatly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of the ending, it felt incredibly rushed to me. All conflicts came to a more or less, hurried happy ending. As soon as the baddie is caught the book has nothing more to do then fall back on its underdeveloped romance between Ismae and Duval. That's not to say I disliked Duval and Ismae. I actually liked both characters a great deal, but together? Not so much. spent entirely too much time revolving around the mystery and not much time developing the relationship. I think the book needed to make its mind up: Romance or plot. It couldn't have both believably, in this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "*mild spoilers* But the part I really disliked about the book was the scene where Ismae had to purge poison from Duval's body by having sex with him. I was relatively enjoying the book up until that point. When I read that scene I rolled my eyes so hard. I mean, really?! REALLY?! She is a nun assassin and the biggest gift Mortain gives her involves her sexuality? She becomes a human bezoar! Would ya look at that? A woman's body really be objectified in almost any profession! Awesome. \\(-_-)/\n",
      "\n",
      "The next book appears to be about Sybella, who I thought would have had a bigger role in this installment. The mystery surrounding the girl was thrown at the reader several times and we are given no information about her assignment. Same goes for Annith's story. I found that incredibly frustrating. I realize this is supposed to be a series and perhaps their stories will be told in the sequels, but leaving those gaps made seem incomplete. I can't help to think the book would have been stronger as a stand alone novel instead of stretching their stories out over three books.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, will I continue on with this series? At this time, probably not. But I would still recommend it to others looking for a change-up in their usual YA readings, especially those who enjoy historic fiction with romance and a pleasant splash of paranormal.\n",

      "- i have to admit the beginning was very brief, we barely got to see her life in the convent and then it was mentioned somewhere how she spent 3 years there or smthing and i was like\n",
      "- i do wish we got to see her interact with her convent sisters more and the bonds they build bc they do continue their friendship throughout the book but its not as solidified for the reader bc there isn't any background events to back it up\n",
      "- and we didn't get to see her train, it was just very very brief and passed through really quickly\n",
      "- that's probably my only dislikes about this book\n",
      "- FROM THERE ON, WE GET THIS ANGSTY RELATIONSHIP THAT IS SO SLOWBURN AND BEAUTIFUL AND ADORABLE\n",
      "- basically its haters to lovers but they arent really enemies bc they serve the same side, they just really dislike each other and THEY'RE KINDA FORCED TO BE IN A FAKE RELATIONSHIP\n",
      "- aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n",
      "- (basically my new favourite thing)\n",
      "- that along with the political intrigue, schemes, court life, plotting, secrecy, treachery, its ALL so well crafted\n",
      "- i thought the author did an INCREDIBLE job of balancing the plot, action, and romance.\n",
      "- as much as im going on about the ship (they stole my heart from the beginning im weak) it was sprinkled throughout the novel so it's not heavy on the mush\n",
      "- its just every moment where they sniped at each other i was\n",
      "- damn i love a well written ship\n",
      "- and then when he referred to her (SARCASTICALLY) as 'my fair assassin' & 'my little rebel' i fricken went ALL HEART EYES ldjfljaFJKDAFLA I LOVE THEM SO MUCH\n",

I am super excited to get into the other books in this series. I recommend this book to people that love excitement and a fast pace book. It always had something interesting going on. It was very well written. I was super impressed with the whole book. If anyone needs a book this is the book for you! This book can kind of be frustrating too. There were some things that I was kind of confused by but it all works out in the end.\n",

The book itself is a page-turner. After the 4 book the plot got really good. Spoiler ahead. Hatch's loyal children help an EGG escape and Hatch sends them to their deaths in a rat pit.\n",

      "This is a clever book by a very funny man - or do I mean a funny book by a clever man?\n",
      "\n",
      "Think mad science in the school playground - Terry Pratchett meets Dr. Strangelove. Howard Carter is living the kind of childhood you'd like to think Neal Stephenson had, or maybe Richard Feynmann.\n",
      "\n",
      "Howard is about to save the world (from aliens, natch) but I'm four chapters in and still not sure how he's going to go about it, given that despite his fiendish cleverness he's barely capable of surviving in human society. He's the kind of boy who, upon discovering that he's never selected for basketball, creates a robot so impressive that his peers are terrified into picking him - whereupon the opposing side picks the robot and Howard ends up being trounced by his own creation. Little does he know it, but Howard has real friends at this new school, as well as the robots he creates (one of which is responsible for a truly terrible pun. No, I'm not going to repeat it. That would only encourage him).\n",
      "\n",
      "This all pales into insignificance when the earth is invaded, and our survival is dependent on Howard and his scientific wizardry. (A time machine that runs on ice lollies!) Can he do it? Or will he be thwarted by the shenanigans of the faceless members of government thinktank WARD? And what does his new science teacher have to do with anything?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is entertainment at its best - accessible to reasonably good readers of any age, but clever enough to keep the attention of adults. It has a protagonist with breathtaking intelligence, named after the discoverer of Tutankhamen of course. And footnotes. I'm a sucker for a book with footnotes. Can't stop - I need to get back and read some more.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Perkins's novel is a good old fashioned sci-fi romp in the vein of the likes of Douglas Adams, classics like Doctor Who, and the wild imaginings of twelve-year-olds building universes out of Legos and cardboard boxes. The story was both intimate and familiar while also interspersed with the science, imagination, and creativity of speculative fiction. I recommend this book to anyone, even if you don't otherwise enjoy sci-fi.\n",

      "This book is simply delightful!\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this book deals with the possible destruction of the world, with the fate of humanity resting on the shoulders of an eleven-year-old boy, that doesn't stop this writer from crafting an incredibly readable and funny book!\n",
      "\n",
      "As the impossibilities mounted up, and the story grew, I found myself not caring about the typos I kept running into, because the story was just too delightful!\n",
      "\n",
      "This book makes wonderful use of footnotes, which you will definitely want to read, starting right at the title page! Don't dismiss them, because as well as providing insight into the world of young Howard Carter, they are also very funny.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lynn has this sweet, spunky style that makes this book seem less like a nonfiction book and more like a chat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chock full of short devotions perfect for reading right after the alarm pulls you from bed to announce the beginning of the school day or right before you dive beneath the covers (I tried both, so I know), this is a devotional that speaks right to a girl's heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There's Scripture. There's story (my favorite part). There's something to do to live out the truth contained in this book (pulled right from the greatest Book). There's prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really, it's a ready-made quiet time there for the taking.\n",
      "\n",
      "And perfect for the teenage girl who wants to know God and His love in a deeper way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why I Recommend This Book\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You could read it along with Lynn's first book. You could read it all on its lonesome. I read it not quite sure whether or not I would learn or if I would end up reviewing it for teenage girls, wishing I had read it when I was younger. Nah. It fits for both, really, the girls who are still girls and the young women who daily need a fresh dose of Jesus' love.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This would make a great Christmas gift for the young woman in your life!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you to the author for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review!\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I like this book from the opening sentence of the introduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Infatuation is a powerful thing. It has the power to make your mind, body, and heart soar. Then, faster than you can say your ex-boyfriend’s name, it can drop you leaving you sick to your stomach.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now what girl hasn’t experienced the roller coaster ride of infatuation. Yet she goes on to describe something far better.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is something more powerful–revolutionary love. Love that is perfect, unconditional, stable. Love that is not based on what you did for it yesterday or what you can do for it in the future. This love forgives and forgets the past while promising an amazing future. This love is Jesus.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also like that Lynn points girls to the real book that makes the most difference in their life-God’s word. Through short one page devotionals that are numbered rather than dated, which focus on topics today’s teen’s can easily relate, girls can start their day off focused on scripture and how it comes to life in their daily life. Even the most busiest teen can easily incorporate the daily readings into their hectic schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disclosure: I was provided a complimentary copy of the book as a part of First Wild Card Tours in exchange for a review. Views and opinions expressed are my own.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Lynn writes about reality -- real thoughts, real dilemmas, real emotions. Her goal is to open a girl's heart and strengthen the spark of faith within. Each of these 365 devotions includes a verse of Scripture, a meditation, a brief prayer and an action idea titled \"Start the Revolution.\" A great way to start (or end) each day.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I had had a devotional like this one when I was young, I might better have understood and appreciated my faith, seen it as a living thing, and have been better able to set boundaries for myself. Without heart ownership, faith can be an arid thing that relies on external controls, rather than internal motivation. Girls in particular need this kind of encouragement and affirmation to negotiate the rocky teen years successfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book makes a great companion volume to Lynn Cowell's earlier book, His Revolutionary Love, a book that shows how faith can fulfill a girl's deepest desires for love, identity, significance and acceptance.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Lynn's latest book, Devotions for a Revolutionary Year is a must have item for every teen girl to start her morning on the right track. Before the books release over 5,000 signed up to receive Lynn’s 7 Day Faith Builder via her web site! Lynn offers quick but power-packed, from the very heart of Jesus devotions relevant to today's teen girl, equipping her with the knowledge that Jesus loves her and is the only one who can fill her love gap. This book has my highest recommendation and is the official devotional of the Whatever Girls.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I work with pre-teens and teens for my church's youth group...and I write for young adults. I highly recommend this devotional. What a great variety of subjects this deals with! Not only does this have awesome daily devotions, it also has daily challenges, or as Lynn calls them, \"Start the Revolution\". For example: \"Here's a reading project. Read all the words spoken by Jesus in the book of John.\" I just love those extra tid-bits. She also has short prayers for the reader to say at the end of each devotion. This would make a great Christmas gift for the young adult in your life.\n",

      "I have so many books at home I could read, but of course my friend asks me to go to the library with her and of course I had to say yes... Why wouldn't I, I mean hello -plenty of books! I was in my usual section, the section where I found Lolita, and was browsing, not really searching for something except maybe a future read... Yet I found three books I couldn't put down and ignore until a better time. I had to take them. This is one of the three books and I'm proud of myself for taking it -yes even if I don't need to go to the library because, yes I have that many books to read at home.\n",

      "On to the review of this book: the 100 tales are not exactly the typical westernized (read Walt Disney) fairy tales and because I had no expectation except having fun reading cute and fun stories: I was in no point disappointed. I had never read full original fairy tales before, those that are not edited by Walt Disney or even retold fairy tales from talented authors. I do have a book of original fairy tales (monstrous actually!) but I still haven't found the time to read it. Because of that, I have no basis of comparison to critic if these were better or not than my other reads on the same subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a first read on original fairy tales, I loved it. I really-really did. Some of them were cute, some a little less so, yet always as good. I don't believe women have as much as a place in those than in our stories, even if there was a full sections on women. Most of them, if correctly remembered, were about men and with a secondary character that was female and sometimes the woman was absent from the story all together. The tales were more like lessons people should learn... Like that section on greed, which was maybe my favorite of them all, maybe. I'm not quite sure because the book was full of great interesting stories.\n",

      "Film noir fans rejoice!!! Here is a book, written by noir film maven Muller, which will expand on your knowledge about the special genre of film that has become rather a cult phenomenon. These dark, raw, and gritty movies, shot in black and white, were made mostly by second level studios or as \"B\" features by the majors, They became popular during the post WWII era through the early 1950s and were rediscovered in the 1990s, receiving the long overdue kudos from critics and fans alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author's approach to telling the story of the noir film is unusual......he creates Dark City and develops each neighborhood (Sinister Heights, the Precinct, Hate Street, Shamus Flats, Vixenville, Blind Alley, Psych Ward, Knockover Square, Loser's Lane, and Thieves' Highway) into which he fits the films that reflect that neighborhood. In this manner, the list of films has some categorical coherency as opposed to putting them in chronological or alphabetical order.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are a noir fan, you know the actors.......Marie Windsor, Ida Lupino, Charles McGraw, Sterling Hayden, Ted de Corsia, Lizabeth Scott, . Meaner than snakes, totally amoral, not to be trusted, and dangerous, these actors played characters that were not your next door neighbors and they played them to the hilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some true overlooked gems contained in this excellent history of noir film. There is the extra added attraction of short biographies of some of the directors/actors responsible for the loyalty of fans who were not even born when these films were made. Highly recommended.\n",

      "\n",
      "Follow-up costs? What follow-up costs can there possibly be hidden in a harmless book? In the case of Eddie Muller’s crazy roller-coaster of a homage to film noir the answer is quite simple: You will end up buying loads of films to complete your noir collection while following the author on his tour de force through the Mean Streets of Dark City. For example such forgotten gems as Edward Dmytryk’s “The Sniper” (1952), Robert Wise’s “Born to Kill” (1947), Joseph Losey’s “The Prowler” (1951) or Otto Preminger’s “Fallen Angel” (1945), films which Muller discusses in comparative detail and which as yet I had not had in my noir collection. Let alone several other films which I could not order since they have not yet found their way on DVD – and I would so much like to see Robert Ryan bully Ido Lupino in “Beware, My Lovely” (1952)!\n",
      "\n",
      "A look at the book itself will already tell you that this may be unusual fare because with its 21.5 cm height and 25 cm breadth it will not easily fit among the other titles in my bookshelf but instead it will stick out. So does Muller’s way of dealing with the topic: Whereas Foster Hirsch in his knowledgeable study applies a rather systematic approach by looking at literary backgrounds, at the development of the cinema that is mirrored in noir, at noir stylistics, at noir directors, at actors and at typical narrative patterns, or whereas the various Noir Readers edited by Alain Silver and James Ursini give you scholarly in-depth studies of single films or particular aspects of film noir, Eddie Muller makes the world of noir come to life again by linking the films with the stories behind them. This can at times take on a rather muck-raking attitude – Gene Tierney’s private ordeal is described in what I would deem a very sensationalist style, and Gloria Grahame’s sex life is exposed in a lot of detail, for instance – but often it proves very elucidating, e.g. when Muller writes about the infamous HUAC or studio politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Muller structures his book by taking us to various places of Dark City, which all stand for certain narrative patterns or sub-genres: In his chapter “Sinister Heights”, for instance, he deals with films centring on gangsters and their influence on society, in “Hate Street” we are invited to take a look behind the bourgeois façade of families like the Dietrichsons (“Double Indemnity”) or at deadly , like in “The Postman Always Rings Twice”, in “Shamus Flats” we get to know the typical noir detective, in “Blind Alley” Muller deals with the fatalism that is so typical of noir, and “Vixenville” might speak for itself. Ah, “Deadly Is the Female”! [1] In a way, this is a very systematic approach but it allows Muller to proceed in a less scholarly way that is rather based on association. Still, while he often gives quite detailed summaries of films that are important to his cause – his language makes sure that this is entertaining reading, though –, he manages to offer a lot of interesting insight – as, for example, when he detects an acid attack on middle-class hypocrisy in a seemingly harmless noir like “The Prowler”. Or, even more surprising to me, when he makes a sound case for considering Raoul Walsh’s “White Heat” a conservative film in that it does not see crime as partly caused by social iniquities but rather as the result of a “mother complex”.\n",
      "\n",
      "I already mentioned Muller’s language. He adopts a very casual style, trying to imitate the tough talk that features in so many noir films, which might seem off-putting and contrived at the start but soon adds to the flair of the whole book. [2] I also liked the way in which Muller does not shy away from taking up a stance: He leaves no doubt that he does not particularly like Orson Welles as a person, and his commentary that Ida Lupino was an artist who, to the chagrin of modern critics, “never stooped to define herself in terms of gender” (p.177) may not be politically correct but is at least honest and refreshing, and true. A similar refreshing jab at “the cultural elite who had adopted its post-everything attitude” (p.191) made me nearly drown in my coffee for laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last not least, the book is full of appetizing stills from lots and lots of noir movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to dive into the intricacies of noir cinema and learn something about critics’ theories and if you are not afraid of scholarly mumbo-jumbo, the Noir Readers mentioned above would be more to your taste, but for those who love film noir and want to read a very, very long essay written by someone who shares this love, Eddie Muller’s book is a very good choice.\n",
      "\n",

      "[1] This impressive film is actually dealt with in the chapter “Loser’s Lane” under its better-known title “Gun Crazy”.\n",

      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Stylistically it’s not your typical book about films - it’s neither a dry and comprehensive encyclopaedia, nor a chronological run through a film genre. Much of Eddie Muller’s ‘Dark City’ is written in the hard boiled tradition of novels and short stories on which the noir films were based. After a couple of intro’s, he divides the book into thirteen chapters that cover some of the chief themes within the genre; so we take a walk through ‘Sinister Heights’ to delve into the criminally corrupt; ‘The Precinct’ to look over battered law enforcement officials; ‘Hate Street’ to peer and ruminate over ruined relationships; ‘The City Desk’ to study the media; ‘Shamus Flats’ to scrutinise the dogged and tired PI’s; and ‘Vixenville’ to admire and analyse the motivations of the femme fatale etc etc. Muller imparts his knowledge in a very readable, atmospheric, and entertaining style.\n",
      "\n",
      "I read the new edition from 2021 which has been glossily produced with expanded text and additional photo’s (all beautifully printed, and given the landscape format of the book, ensure that no pictures are spoiled by being spread over two pages).\n",
      "\n",
      "What is and what isn’t a film noir is always a question for debate. Is it the themes? The look? Or both? A dull and pointless exercise! Anyway, almost all of my favourites are here – Laura, Out Of The Past, Double Indemnity, The Maltese Falcon, Possessed, On Dangerous Ground, Where The Sidewalk Ends etc, plus a few\n",
      "\n",
      "My only minor gripes? The overly small text (which sadly precluded my mother’s reading of the book). And regarding Alfred Hitchcock, I think it’s a pity Muller chooses to quote and reference Donald Spoto’s rather dubious biography - which from memory had a silly dark pseudo-analysis agenda which could be applied to any character study for sensationalist marketing effect!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Eddie Muller’s book is an enjoyable read, and given its glossy layout and well selected pictures, is a book well worth owning.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Eddie Muller is a genial presence on his \"Noir Alley\" show on Turner Classic Movies (TCM), but he is also a goldmine of information on film noir. His Dark City: The Lost World of Film Noir (Revised and Expanded Edition) is an excellent thematic survey of the world of noir. There are chapters on law enforcement, ruined relationships, the press, detectives, vixens, and a dozen other themes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Muller's selection of film stills is excellent, and his little sidebars on such noir figures as Robert Ryan, Ida Lupino, Sterling Hayden, John Garfield, Gloria Grahame, and others add interesting background info. Also, Muller's insights are right on the money, as when he writes:\n",
      "Although I read the book on Kindle, I am seriously thinking of getting a paper copy of the book.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Dark City is noir czar Eddie Muller’s entertaining and informative exploration of film noir. Since film noir is essentially an urban phenomenon, Muller looks at film noir as if it were a city, and focuses chapters on different noir themes or aspects, relating them to the different sections of Dark City. In Knockover Square you’ll find a lively discussion of heist films; Sinister Heights is where the corrupt and wealthy reside; and if you’re lucky enough to escape Vixenville alive, you’ll probably find yourself on Losers’ Lane or Thieves’ Highway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Muller writes in a very entertaining, flowery style channeled through the lingo and tone of the films themselves. His discussions of the movies branch out into discussions of authors, directors, and especially actors associated with film noir, finding a remarkable number of lives that mirror the sordid tales these films tell. Dark City is, of course, Hollywood itself, as these many sidebars amazingly illustrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with most of his thoughts, disagree with a few, and was inspired by several ideas he has. For instance, he makes a strong case for why the melodramatic, unnatural acting and visual style is preferable in these films to their “realistic” neo-noir counterparts. “Vivid, dynamic imagery – and vivid, dynamic acting – stick in the mind long after the extraneous details of ‘naturalism’ have evaporated,” Muller writes. “Modern film noir plays like real life. Classic film noir plays like fevered memory.” And on the topic of P.I.’s like Spade and Marlowe, Muller makes a most intriguing suggestion as for their inclusion as noir heroes. Writing on , he notes, “Daniel Mainwaring (writing as Geoffrey Homes) constructed an involuted tale that owned up to what most films in the genre only hinted at: these stories are about the protagonist’s quest for solutions to his own problems, not the client’s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some select comments that provide a nice sample of Muller’s writing style:\n",
      "\n",
      "“For years, critics have troweled endless symbolism onto Kiss Me Deadly, finding hidden meaning in character names, checkerboard floor tiles, veiled allusions to Greek myths, even in Nick the mechanic’s Va-Va-Voom tagline. That’s a lot of extra baggage for Hammer to stuff into the boot of his tiny roadster. No such acclaim attached itself to Aldrich’s Attack!, a better film made the following year, and a darker vision of the human battlefield. But through the magic of critical hindsight, this swaggering, brass-knuckled lark has been hoisted into the pantheon of “meaningful” movies. What it really deserves is a place on any double bill with Dr. Strangelove: a pair of mordant black comedies about dangerous demagogues in places high and low.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Although the times dictated fables in which the renegade double-X chromosome must be vanquished before the fade-out, film noir allowed women to savor for themselves the pungent, acrid nectar of unleashed power and violence. “A dame with a rod is like a guy with a knitting needle,” cracks Jack Fisher (Steve Brodie) in . Of course, that’s before Fisher gets an extra orifice blown open compliments Kathie Moffet (Jane Greer), one of Vixenville’s empresses. There’s no greater kick in this town than when a woman finally wraps her delicate fingers around the trigger of a .38 Linga and blasts away every bit of genetic encoding and cultural repression in a roaring fusillade of little lead forget-me-nots.”\n",

According to Ditchfield, he meant that, “God is so merciful - He reveals Himself to those who truly seek Him, even if they are coming at it from the wrong direction. This was certainly Lewis’ experience when he met God after thirty years as an atheist.”\n",

      "Finding Cinderella was a beautifully written, deeply heart warming novella that made me laugh, cry, and fall in love. In less than 100 pages, it made me more than I have in many entire books. Daniel and Six captured my heart and I hope that one day we get more of their story because I’m not ready to let go yet!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was originally going to talk about the plot here but honestly, I think it’ll be more fun to just discover it for yourselves. Suffice it to say that I absolutely adored every word of story – it was fun, quirky and unique.\n",
      "\n",
      "In case you don’t remember, Daniel and Six were Holder and Sky’s best friends from and and while this novella reads as a standalone, it would have greater meaning if you read both those books first. Also, fans of Holder and Sky will be happy to know that they have several scenes in this and it was a real treat to see them from the outside through someone else’s eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The character dynamics are just gold, the writing is witty and, true to Colleen Hoover’s style, you are made to care deeply about every part of these characters’ lives. I have quotes highlighted on each page and while the majority of the story kept me laughing out loud, swooning and chuckling to myself, there were also strong emotional reveals that had me in tears and brought a really wonderful depth to it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was short enough to read in one sitting but long enough to never feel rushed and give you that feeling of reading a ‘complete’ story. I finished it with a huge smile on my face and the happiest feeling in my heart.\n",

Üçüncü kişi ise belki çok şaşıracaksınız, Kral Arthur. Arthur'la ilgili bildiğimiz her şey burada var. Excalibur, Gölün Hanımı, kayadan kılıç çıkarması falan. Ben daha fazla hikaye olmasını isterdim ama çok fazlası malesef yok. Tekrarlıyorum sonuçta bu bir efsane ve hepsi bu kitapta mıdır değil midir bilemiyorum. Her şeye rağmen okunabilir.

      "\n",
      "* Is your bookcase overflowing with strong, decisive heroines?\n",
      "* Do you chuckle over the animated Gorey titles preceding a PBS “Mystery!” presentation?\n",
      "* Are you fond of the Victorian era?\n",
      "* Does witty prose make you positively giddy with excitement?\n",
      "* Have you ever lingered over a bit of lace or wistfully touched a velvet coat?\n",

      "If the answer to most of these questions is “yes” then you musn’t hesitate—it’s quite possible that will thoroughly please your palate and leap right onto your “favorites” shelf. If the answer is “no,” then clearly this is a book to be most assuredly avoided.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will have to forgive my enthusiasm in this review. I was positively in ecstasies over the witty language as I was reading this deliciously dotty book, and even as I write this it’s hard to keep from smiling. The story follows Miss Alexia Tarabotti, a preternatural being who has the ability to remove supernatural powers as long as she is touching the other person. Alexia is a clever bluestocking with revoltingly independent tendencies and an unfortunate weakness for treacle tarts. As a spinster, she’s resigned herself to hovering on the edges of glittering social engagements--that is, until she gets caught up in the mystery surrounding a strange vampire attack that flaunts all the rules of polite society. Not to mention that such attacks are a serious breach of good manners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meticulously detailed and overflowing with good humor, is a like a cozy mystery run mad, set in an inventive alternate universe populated with a dizzying array of colorful characters. I’m quite sure that Gail Carriger has been busily spying my bookshelves to see all of the different kinds of books I enjoy and wrote this for me, as I jotted notes continuously as I read because I found so much to exclaim over. If you’re curious about the writer’s style, I would strongly recommend downloading the preview chapter to try or having a look at my status updates, since I quoted a fair number of my favorite lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven’t read that many steampunk novels yet, but it’s hard to imagine that there could be another one that blends the Victorian era and imaginative paranormal fiction as seamlessly as this one does. I loved the marvelous descriptions of glassicals, carriages outfitted with tea kettles and viewing lenses, and the various steam-powered machines and engines.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What I appreciate most about this book, however, is that the author did a splendid job of melding mystery, steampunk, and romance together in such a wonderful way while observing the customs and attitudes of the Victorian era. I have such a pet peeve about novels that are set in this time that largely ignore traditional views towards women or the rules of society; while I don’t expect every historical novel I pick up (especially light-hearted entertainers like this one) to be completely accurate, it is a joy to find a book that is so thoroughly researched and comfortable with the manners and mores of the period. Although Alexia is obviously a supernatural being with unusual powers, she also has the same concerns as other women of her time: the feminine role in society, the need for security through marriage, the uncomfortable marginalization of thinking women, etc. I felt enormous sympathy for Alexia when she says simply, “I would so like something useful to do.” The author spends just enough time working these details into the story before she transcends those issues and gives our heroine the means to overcome her problems in a completely enjoyable way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the big confrontation occurs towards the end, however, I did feel that the book lost a bit of its momentum since it would have been better if things were wrapped up more quickly, and the paranormal aspects of Alexia's abilities are perhaps a little on the slight side. There was also a bit more romance in the novel than I expected, but you know, I’m as willing to be seduced by a handsome werewolf as the next lady, so I was happy to go along with that part of the story. It’s not a hardship when Miss Tarabotti and Lord Maccon are such well-matched individuals. And, um, some of their scenes together made this reader fan herself more than once.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had such a wonderful time reading this novel. This style of writing and humor and story will not be for everyone, but I found it to be hysterically funny, swooningly romantic, and thoroughly entertaining. I absolutely adore it.\n",

      "So, I’ve got something else to blame on Glee. In addition to all the terrible eighties music that I’ve been listening to, and image of that terrible Mozart spaceman outfit gone wrong that they put Kurt in for the Gaga episode, I feel certain that the same people who decide on the structure and performance of that show are the same people who decided that it was okay to release Soulless in the form that I read it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At it’s heart, Glee is simply a weak, changeable framework for presenting touchstones of cultural nostalgia and niche enthusiasms, with interspersed attempts at taking advantage of whatever cultural phenomena have been raking in money over the past few years. The plot, characters and setting all radically and inconsistently change as necessary to allow the producers to put on a show about songs and stories that people feel are an integral enough part of their past or current identity to get them to watch the show each week. The problem with all this is that if you present a musical revue as an ongoing story, then people (at least people like me), will attach certain expectations to the story they’re reading. This is especially true of any genre storytelling- that is, storytelling that will trigger something in the audience’s brain that tells them how to process the joke that’s just been told, how to view the characters, and therefore how to judge the story’s conclusion or lack thereof. Glee is written by three different people who do not seem to communicate well to each other, and following any sort of story gets difficult: one minute we’re watching a mean-but-you-gotta-laugh-cause-he’s-right commentary on culture and the media, the next minute it’s a Very Special Episode that asks us all to sing kumbaya and feel bad for those less fortunate than ourselves. It’s gotten especially jarring over the back half of the first season (I maintain that there were several episodes in the first half that were genuinely good!). These genres do not sit well next to each other, each exposing the weaknesses and downright awful or mean aspects of the other- ie, Are these characters supposed to be simply cardboard cutouts that offer conscious criticism and zippy one liners? Or are they supposed to be real people for me to engage with and treat as I would a real person in that situation? You’ve gotta pick one and tell me what’s up, ‘cause otherwise it’s an uncomfortable and unrewarding viewing experience, and that feeling is gonna outweigh even my undying love for Journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a very similar experience with Soulless. There’s a lot of genres elbowing for room in here-Regency comedy of manners, Victorian gothic, steampunk, urban fantasy, PG Wodehouse comedy, a bit of SATC, and a prissy bodice ripper (if that seems contradictory, well, just look at the rest of the list!). The author herself talks about this in the little mini interview in the back of my edition of the book, how “suddenly, I was juggling more subgenres than Ivy has ugly hats!” (Oh, don’t worry, we’ll get there in a minute.) Now, I like a lot of these genres separately- and I am aware that there are lots of other people out there who read some sort of combination of these genres, and I saw the hand of the producers at work. Separately, I like all these things. Together?: It’s a Queen medley on top of a Spice Girls cameo with some Green Day background noise, a Broadway power ballad’s notes soaring over it all and whatever the hell that Sugar Ray song was that I now can’t get out of my head- goddamn this idea for a review!- providing the remix beats. Why, Carriger, why must you try to ruin innocent genres who committed no other crime but being so awesome??\n",
      "\n",
      "Our heroine, Alexia Tarabotti, is a pretty straight up Cinderella/Jane Eyre type, who just happens to have special magical powers (she’s soulless- but there are no downsides I can see to this except that there may be no heaven for you if it exists, but she seems cool with this). She is an Indomitable Fantasy Heroine Who Can Take Care of Herself, and a Wounded Duckling who thinks nobody likes her, even though she is prettier, smarter, wittier and has better boobs than anyone in the room. Now, that trope is pretty tiresome- even Tina Fey doing it ironically on as a commentary on Hollywood standards has started to grate on me. But fine, it’s a genre stereotype and whatever. The problem comes when Carriger applies different standards to the things that come out of her mouth- for example, her treatment of Ivy Hisselpenny, which pissed me off to no end. Now mind you, this is a woman Alexia calls her “dearest friend,” who she visits regularly and spends a good deal of her time with. It slowly emerges that Alexia finds her shallow, stupid and desperate for a man, as well as having terrible taste with all those “ugly hats”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now aside from all the “how would she know if she’s soulless?” comments people have already made, I thought that, more importantly, Alexia was not a nice person. I’m sorry I can’t state it in a more nuanced way than that, but it really made me angry. Ivy seemed to be yet another foil to make sure we knew just how Special a Special Snowflake Alexia was, and for Alexia to use for emotional comfort... while being completely comfortable with viciously making fun of her a few pages later. The genre mixing problem shows here because I think Alexia’s opinion of Ivy, the possessor of ugly hats, is exactly how PG Wodehouse might characterize a person in one of his short stories, as so-“And as for Miss Hisselpenny- she wore an ugly hat- we need say no more!” Fine, but as the book goes on, Alexia’s story gets more and more melodramatic and Tearjerking, with involved Gothic plots and character development past the opening farce, and I’m supposed to feel bad for how badly she’s been treated, ie, see her as a real person. And you know what? I don’t like any person if the nicest thing you appear to be able to say about your best friend is that she’s a shallow bimbo who wears bad hats. I’m left to assume the only reason she hangs out with her is because she’s one of the only characters with less social standing than Alexia, so she can feel secure that she’s better than her. Actually, Alexia doesn’t have a good opinion about other woman she encounters in the book. If all other women are torn down as unworthy in a book that’s, in the end, about women ending up with men, I'm pretty sure I know what the reason is. And it makes it pretty clear to me who really puts the most importance on getting a man. Speaking of which, another example: we hear over and over that Alexia aspires to Lofty Intellectual Ideals and scorns gossipy, shallow women. But then she indulges in gossip later with Lord Akeldama’s (her Sassy Gay Friend) sassy gay chorus (which includes at least one incredibly offensive gay stereotype-the one named Biffy who magically knows how to do her hair in the most current French fashion!), and we’re supposed to see the gossip as naughty, titillating fun that all sophisticates take part in. So now she’s in Sex and the City and Pamela at once? Again, PICK ONE. Because honestly, presented that way, it seems like just another excuse for the author to give her more male attention. In short, she takes funny and good things about various genres and makes them mean and self-serving.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could go on with the many other similar travesties this book commits, never mind the misunderstanding of Jane Austen, the completely unthinking racism and classism committed while imitating authors from earlier eras, not to even MENTION the insult to the Greek philosophers (which Elizabeth has covered nicely) or science of all kinds. But I think I have made my displeasure clear enough to anyone dedicated enough to reach the end of this review.\n",

      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Ms. Carriger, congratulations! This was a great ride. I can honestly say that I laughed myself silly reading this book. This is one of those books that will probably embarrass you if you read it in public. You have been warned! This is the first novel that I've read that managed to cleverly and gently satirize the conventions of historical romance, and it was done in a manner that was utterly irresistible. I have not read any Wodehouse, but I imagine I will like him very much, if he is indeed an influence on this author's writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only did I enjoy the humor, I thought the characters were beyond interesting. Alexia is one of those heroines that will stand out in the reader's mind. She's intelligent, gutsy, fierce, yet ladylike and admirable. Although she has moments where she's down on herself (she seemed unable to accept that Lord Maccon was interested in her, but it totally made sense to me), she manages to be remarkably comfortable in her own skin. I believe that this is a big part of her appeal to Lord Maccon. Alexia is an alpha woman that I really like. She doesn't come on too strong, and she knows her limits. Throwing her weight around is not a tactic that she resorts to. But if you try something, she will make sure you know it's not happening. I liked that she was a woman of her times, in that she was strong, intelligent, and passionate; yet, she possessed the morals and understandings of what was appropriate in her society. Alexia's ability felt very novel to me. I especially liked how she used it when she interacted with the supernatural people in her life, especially Lord Maccon. There's a really good part where Alexia has to get up close and person with a naked Lord Maccon to keep him from changing back into a wolf. And they sure do take advantage of that moment. Naked Lord Maccon, up close and personal, who could blame a girl?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, let's talk about Lord Maccon. Three words: To Die For! I loved him. Not too surprising, since I happen to adore, big, sexy, Scottish werewolves. But it's the whole package with him. I like that he's rough around the edges. Smooth operators bore me. The unpolished, fierce heroes, they get me everytime. Ooh, he had me reading this book furiously to get to the next scenes with he and Alexia. I loved all his scenes, in human and in werewolf form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexia and Lord Maccon had awesome chemistry. This is not really a romance novel, so the reader must keep this in mind. Soulless is more of a fantasy with a very strong romance. If you take that into consideration and enjoy the ride, the romantic moments will be a pleasant surprise on top of the humor and the fantastic elements. Having said that, I loved all the smootchy/getting personal scenes. This book has that element of Victorian romance that I just love. The whole \"we are passionately carried away, but this is really improper and I hope we don't get caught\" theme really works for me. I loved how they couldn't seem to keep their hands off each other. Very appealing! Alexia and Lord Maccon are going on my favorite couples list. No doubt about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now to the fantasy/steampunk elements. I thought Ms. Carriger did a great job. Initially, I had to get used to the writing style. Like I said earlier, I haven't read too many satirical-styled stories. I had to realize that I couldn't take things too seriously. Once I got into that mode, I was good. This book is an interesting hybrid in that it's definitely a humorous story, but there are some edgy, dark elements, as well. The automaton was pretty darn creepy. I immediately started thinking about golems when it was first introduced. I liked how she took the golem folklore and gave it a steampunk twist. I could completely understand why Alexia found it so repulsive. It was alive, but so opposite from what a living being might be. I liked the adventure aspects. This book made me think of the old school adventure storytellers like Jules Verne, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and Edgar Rice Burroughs, although this book doesn't stray far from the drawing rooms and polite environs of London and its suburbs. I could easily imagine Ms. Carriger writing a ripping, neo-pulp adventure yarn. If she does, sign me up! I hope she has a Roxton-esque hero if she does. Hint, Hint. I definitely think this would make a great movie (in the right hands).\n",
      "\n",
      "Steampunk is a new, but beloved genre for me. When it comes to technical and mechanical devices, I have no imagination. So I have to give it to Ms. Carriger for writing these aspects very well. I had a very good visual picture of the steam-driven, clockwork technology in my head while I was reading. Yet, she didn't overdo it so that I was more focused on trying to picture these devices and not focused on the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vampires and werewolves are the main supernatural beasties in this story. They are very politically and socially-organized, to the degree that they have advisors to the queen herself. I admit, I really had to focus on this aspect, needing to reread a few paragraphs to really gain an understanding of the social structure of the two supernatural groups. But it was time well spent. I liked reading about the social dynamics of the vampire society, divided up into hives, each with a Queen vampire (she's the only one who can make new vamps), and having human servants called drones. Lord Akeldama, Alexia's flamboyant friend who happens to be a very powerful vampire, was a hoot. His fashion sense was outrageous, and he kept me laughing. On the werewolf side, I was enamored with Professor Lyall, the competent, extremely intelligent beta to the Alpha werewolf, Lord Maccon, Earl of Woolsey. I hope to see a lot more of Prof. Lyall. The werewolf pack dynamics were especially interesting to me, werewolf lover that I am. I absolutely love the werewolf salute given to Alexia at the end of this book. I was practically clapping. I think you could see that the vamps and weres were very integrated into society, and a huge part of the governmental workings of the author's concept of Great Britain of the 19th Century. It really gives a different perspective on the British Empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Man, this was a great read. If you're coming from a romance or a contemporary urban fantasy background, this book will take you out of your comfort zones, but it's so worth it. Hang in there until you get used to the flow of the language (it's very 19th century), and relax and enjoy the witty humor (it's very funny). You will have a great time. Don't forget to bring your tricked-out parasol and glassicals, just in case.\n",

      "What is most surprising about Hannaham's tale is how superbly he handles all sides of the issue. Gary is absolutely sincere in his desire to change that which can never be, although it is obvious that he's happiest and most 'himself' when he accepts his nature. When he enters a program to 'remove' his homosexuality, a lesser writer would likely use the opportunity to condemn such actions as ludicrous and hateful. But Gary and his teachers are fundamentally good people, led by firm beliefs that what they do is right. This is not an attack on Christianity, but a dissection of people who take the Bible very seriously at the expense of their own unique individualities. There are no cheap shots, no laughs at the expense of bigotry. Hannaham's tale slowly expands itself into an exploration of how we all lie to ourselves to make ourselves feel better, and how we all alter our behaviour to suit the beliefs of others. Gary and his fellow students at the ministry are devout in their belief that they can change an innate portion of their being to satisfy others, even though the entire notion is inherently laughable. The rest of their lives will be spent in hollow denial of themselves, if the treatment actually worked: \"Dr. Soffione's treatment didn't offer a 100 percent cure. From the way Bill and Gay spoke about it, nobody could. Did Christ really want that for us? Would we have to spend the rest of our lives counting the seconds to make sure our hugs didn't go into overtime?\"\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Gary Gray is a hot mess and doesn’t have a clue how to pull his life together. He’s fat, black, gay, and newly married with a child on the way. And he’s convinced he’s going straight to hell. A sad, humorous, and touching story of one man deciding if he is “a for-real homosexual” or “a straight fellow with some problems.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, I thought the writing was a little messy but later changed my mind. Hannaham writes in a way that doesn’t make his main character particularly likeable. And that was probably the point.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Gary Gray has a huge problem. On the one hand he’s young and black, a devout Christian, husband and father; on the other hand he’s secretly gay. His is the story of a black Christian bouncing between desire and belief, between love for his family and his worship of other men. Gary struggles for years to hold his life together with his dark secret always threatening to destroy his fragile world, but then what he believes is a clean way out presents itself – a way to slip away from his life and be someone completely different, with a new set of rules and where his gayness is no longer an issue. But of course, there is never an easy way out of big problems, and Gary must eventually face society, his family, himself, and his God.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found few positive aspects to this story. I generally enjoy stories that pit lifestyle against religious beliefs, and I commend James Hannaham for tackling such a difficult subject. And although I didn’t care for the characters, any of them, they were all very unique, which was somewhat refreshing. I like characters with flaws, as long as their balanced with positives. What I enjoyed most was that the author has a clean, easy-to-read writing style. The book is written in the first person, so we get every detail of what goes through Gary’s dysfunctional head.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had two very major problems with this novel. First, the author never gave me any reason to pull for the narrator. I found the main character, Gary Gray, nauseously pious at times, a raving hypocrite other times, and a sniveling fool most of the time, which these days makes him a candidate for high office in the Republican Party. My point is, since I found absolutely nothing appealing about him, I had nothing to pull for. I didn’t care what happened to him, which made for a dull read. And let me point out here that other readers, particularly Christians, could very well see many positive aspects to the characters. It was purely a personal distaste for the characters, all of them, that made me not care for the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "My second major issue was that it all too often bogged down in numerous details that didn’t seem to add to the plot, character development, or enjoyment of the reader. I felt this was a three-hundred-page story that could have been a much stronger hundred-page story.\n",
      "\n",
      "As stated above, I generally enjoy stories that pit religion against lifestyle, so I came to this novel with high expectations, hoping that it would ignite my imagination and tickle my intellect. But sadly, I didn’t feel a spark of anything except disappointment. This is not a story that I can honestly recommend.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Not exactly a fun read--more fascinating and disturbing than fun. It's the story of a young Christian man struggling with homosexuality. It's heartbreaking at times how he suppresses who he is. I usually think of prejudice as being something one person imposes on another, so it was eye opening to read a story about someone who was prejudiced against himself. It saddens me that it's possible for religion/society to make people suffer so much and hate themselves for who they are.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "this book blew me away. i couldn't say that i loved in the sense that it...was good in the conventional sense. it just spoke to me in a way that i didn't anticipate. i bought it because i thought it was nonfiction, and it had that feel throughout the whole book. it's a novel, however, about the struggle of homosexuality and the Church. it reads like a memoir, and that makes it terrifying. i was deeply affected by this book; i found it hard to put down, hard to give up on. i was repulsed by it, in love with it, but most of all, it made me think. i don't know who i was rooting for throughout the book. i wanted gary to be happy most of all. i wanted him to leave some things behind, and then i wanted him to be himself. it was awful. but, i was able to step back and appreciate the author for initiating those feelings in me. i cried through parts of these books because my emotions were so strong and involved in what was happening. the book was raw. i don't know if i could handle reading it again. i feel it's an important book to read, however. even though it's graphic and rough, it's enlightening. it changed my schemas, slightly.\n",

      "\n",
      "Review 1\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Like other novels by the talented Dara Horn, this book has layers upon layers that challenge the reader intellectually without pulling you away from the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is, on one level, a retelling of the Biblical story of Joseph, who was sold into bondage in Egypt by his jealous brothers. If you haven’t read that story in a while, I won’t mention many more parallels, lest it be spoilery. But in a nice twist, rather than Joseph, we have a story about Josephine (or “Josie”), and her envious sister Judith. At Judith's encouragement, Josie leaves her husband and young daughter behind to travel to Egypt, and there she is kidnapped by revolutionaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also a story about memory and the gates of perception. What becomes our memories about ourselves and others, and how does that choice or phenomenon affect our interaction with the present and the future?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tying these two themes together are two other themes. (Horn is always complex, making the title of this book sort of a double entendre!). One theme is a fictional retelling of the historical discovery of the Genizah in Cairo. A Genizah is a repository of memories: in the Jewish religion, any object inscribed with the name of God cannot be destroyed, so synagogues designate rooms as repositories for marred, worn, or otherwise damaged documents they could no longer use. This storeroom is known as a Genizah, or “hiding place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Josie has created a computer program to store memories which she calls Genizah. It has been wildly successful. It takes any input - including documents, notes, pictures, and videos - and categorizes them, putting them behind visual “doors”. The more labels or categories one adds to the data, the better the program can sort and retrieve any memories or ideas. Then it can generate patterns so you can see persistent behaviors and themes and perhaps even predict future outcomes. And if we can save the past, and “recreate” people from these memories, haven’t we in some senses “resurrected” them from the dead? And what about the converse: is Hell just ? Is what we all really fear?\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this is echoed in the fourth theme, the great 12th Century work of philosophy by the Jewish scholar Maimonides, . Because of his adaptation of Aristotelian thought to Biblical faith, Maimonides influenced a number of scholars who came after him, including the noted Christian theologian Saint Thomas Aquinas.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the [original] , a copy of which was [actually] discovered in the Cairo Genizah, Maimonides considers the reconciliation of ideas about God's omniscience, omnipotence, and benevolence with (a) the problem of evil in the world, and (b) whether or not this could mean that mankind has free will. As Judith Plaskow (Professor of Religious Studies at Manhattan College) once wrote, the most salient existential dilemma is not how a supposedly good and omnipotent God would permit evil in the world, because we cannot know the answer. Rather, she suggests, a better question is how, given the reality of evil, we deal with it. And how then do we justify faith or lack of faith? What stories do we tell ourselves? These issues become critically important to Josie after she is kidnapped in Cairo, and because she has with her a copy of the Maimonides work, it helps her understand her fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told you there are four basic themes, but actually there are others as well. There are contemporary (or perhaps, more accurately, timeless) ideas explored about marriage and parenting and sibling rivalry, for example. Horn incorporates so many clever layers into this story that it would take a book of my own to explicate them all. If you like intelligent fiction; fiction that makes you think about religious, philosophical, political, technical, and personal issues and how they intersect, Dara Horn is one of the best authors I know who makes this happen. In addition, the story itself, without any layers or higher meaning at all, is a good one; one that is thought-provoking enough on its own to provide endless conversation for a book club or with a reading partner.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I was left speechless by this book. It is a story within a story within a story, all in a larger context of the questions: \"what is memory?\" and \"who am I, really?\" It also explores the superficial and deeper meaning of relationships and connections, providing much food for thought (and Torah drashes, if one is inclined in that direction, as I am). Dara Horn uses the famous text by Moses Maimonides as the inspiration for her title, and incorporates his life and work into the story. It is very hard to comment on this book without telling the story, and to tell the story would ruin it for anyone who wants to read it. Let's just say you don't have to be Jewish to get the message. A long time ago I took an adult ed class on the original Maimonides text, and I am now inspired to study it again. If you are interested in a story with multiple parallel as well as intersecting perpendicular lines, with hidden mysteries revealed yet made more mysterious with each door (a critical image in the book) opened or closed, this is for you. I am ready to read it again, and again, and again.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I have been a big fan of Dara Horn and loved \"The World to Come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I have also done a lot of reading in Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed (I am a rabbi and a philosophy major)\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was looking forward to reading this book a great deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I found it deeply disappointing. I enjoyed the sections on Solomon Schechter and, to a lesser extent, the parts reflecting on the life of Maimonides. Yet the contemporary sections struck me as contrived, completely improbably and, worst of all, cruel. I did not like a single one of the modern characters and did not enjoy spending time with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The very end of the book was mean-spirited. This is a re-telling of the Joseph story, but it re-tells it in a way that lacks the subtlety and hope that comes at the end of the Genesis version. This one ends on hatred and utter despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spare yourself reading this book.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Here is a short list that should tell you everything I think about this book:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. I got it at BEA.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. I carried it around during like the wettest two weeks ever, even in a derecho, and it is pretty well destroyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. I finished it at the park, lying in the last sun rays of the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. I will be gifting it to my mom next time I see her.\n",
      "\n",
      "So there you have it, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "No?\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, let me break it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. means that is going to be pushed by Norton, and also that it's made for mass consumption. These are not things I love.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. means that, although it's not super long, it took me about twice as long to read as normal, indicating that I was not very compelled by it. In fact, the book has three braided plots, and of them was awfully compelling, but every time it got to a cliff-hanger, I had to wade through the next installments of the other two plots, and by time I got back to it I was unfocused at best.\n",

Throughout this book, people in several segments of history are more or less literally falling down wormholes of memory, making for exploration both of memory and of what our responsibility to the past--and the future--is. I loved it--the people and their philosophical conundrums, and what they just might have figured out that I didn't know I needed to know. For example, not everybody has to be a genealogist:\n",

This is the first Dara Horn novel I've read, so I don't know how her work is trending, but did see somewhere or other that this is her most ambitious or intricate work yet. Perhaps she'll eventually jettison the thriller mode and go with the literary. What I think that means is that then she could just let her present-day characters develop as they may without having to subject them to the exigencies of plot, which I thought happened a couple of times. When that happened the story was rolling along so well it jumped right over the hurdle, but still I thought I noticed. The author didn't have to manipulate her historical characters that way; it's the present-day folks who have to advance the action.\n",

Ah, the pangs of sibling rivalry.... Although in reality that could never happen here....\n",

      "It hit me that what I remember about books is the people, not the plot. I think that's true. For example, the Harry Potter books: as soon as I finished one I couldn't tell you what happened in it. And the other day I was writing about , which I read maybe 20 years ago and of which I retained virtually nothing. books? Mostly what people experienced and revealed. Mainly the world of the people, not so much what they did. The heartbreak of the girl in after 50 years. after 30. So all I'm saying is that the plot is there for the characters, not the characters for the plot.\n",

      "Finally, in terms of what this book provoked in me, I have a long-running debate with myself about whether it's always better to know the truth about something that has happened, or could there be some cases in which it would be better not to know. I'm talking about, for example, where an affair has occurred. Should the straying partner keep it a secret? Or must the truth out? I generally fall on the side of the truth. Secrets corrupt. But there was a truth so dark, so terrible, in the Louise Erdrich novel (no, if you haven't read it--I'm not going to tell you what it was) that it almost had me changing my mind. The conclusion of set me back on the side of truth, lest without one's knowing the truth of the past, history might be destined repeat itself.\n",

Written in a very unique and engaging way, there are so many lessons taught and learned. Most importantly, to walk in our own integrity and build the strength to stand true to ourselves and respect every individual, regardless of where we are or who we are with. Brilliant!\n",

      "This story reminded me of Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\" in that a boy journeys away from his life to discover the truths about his place within it. The author did a fantastic job recreating the life of an abused youth with no where to go, as home life is riddled with alcoholism and school bullies won't relent. The characters are vivid and real, and Russell's mastery of dialogue keeps you turning pages. This is a great book for teenagers to read, whether they are dealing with bullies or not. Reminding young people of the different walks in life is the best way to help them learn empathy. Buy this for every teenager in your life!\n",

      "Powergamers rejoice!\n",
      "\n",
      "This late addition to D&D's 3rd edition is a quirky, slightly overpowered expansion, which finally allows fighting-class characters of high level to stack up to wizards and sorcerers, who famously go nuclear around Level 14 or so. The classes contained in this book are some of my favourites, both as classes unto themselves, and as side classes to take a one- or two-level dip into.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be advised, if you play with powergamers, these classes are very easy to unbalance. Things can go sideways real fast if you're not careful. But for power-heavy games, or games where you want to duplicate the feel of more mystic battles with wild thematic sword-saint abilities, it's a great resource for breathing some new life back into your familiar 3.5 edition world. Definitely not a \"necessary\" book, and for advanced players only, but a lot of fun in the right hands with the right attitude.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I had a lot more fun with this one, back in the day, than I probably should have. It's cheesy and over-the-top and all-around ridiculous, but a lot of this edition of D&D was to begin with, and these classes still aren't as strong as clerics or druids.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, save maybe if your DM lets you get away with all the Iron Heart Surge stuff.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The idea was interesting, but I felt that the implementation was really bad. It could just be cultural thing for me. The source material was basically inspired by Oriental martial arts, fighting styles, movies, and anime. I found the whole implementation to be really cheesy and mostly nonsensical.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the sourcebook is about providing melee replacements - so goodbye fighter, ranger, and paladin. If you use this sourcebook, there's zero reasons to play with the original core warrior classes, as the three new classes (crusader, swordsage, and warblade) are way more powerful - unless of course, you happen to want to play a blackguard or you like tracking or archery. The three new classes play like front-line wizards - you can generally cast one \"spell\" (manoeuvre) once per encounter. In fact, as they scale up in power, you probably don't need rogues or wizards much, since some manoeuvres can do sneak attacks and AoE attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sourcebook requires significant investment as it adds a lot of new rules. The majority of the content aside are all geared towards giving the new classes more options. I dislike the new classes primarily because the more they're described felt more like prestige classes to me - all crusaders fight for a religion, all swordsages are scholarly fighters seeking for a \"truth\", and all warblades are glory-seekers. There are nine martial disciplines (hence, nine swords), but they are very oddly restricted to certain classes - why? This is one of the nonsensical things. If we're talking about oriental inspiration, this sourcebook serves up a lot of categorisations and restrictions just for the sake of it. Sure, the DM could change it, but I'm reviewing based on what's offered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Backstory-wise, the Temple of the Nine Swords is fine, I just found the whole internal conflict to be very contrived. The so-called legendary founder? Such a character can't be built using the mechanics presented in this book, due to the limits on the number of manoeuvres you can learn. Throw in how he managed to accumulate nine swords of such varied backgrounds and they just destroyed any plot cohesiveness. And the prestige classes? They're ok within the context of this book, except for the so-called \"Master of Nine\" - that class is more like taking specialist levels in several schools of magic than being a \"master\" of several disciplines. The flavouring is just so wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that's enough ranting. I mainly dislike the sourcebook because I found the flavour and imagery to be really bad. Then I dislike the power level of the new mechanics, they're not just slightly powerful - they're very powerful. I'm probably not the target demographic for this book, seeing how cheesy and over-the-top some of the content are. Perhaps this sourcebook was not meant to be serious, and more a fun thing; but it's not for me.\n",

      "I have a feeling that you will either love it (having not read the other books) or dislike it based on the JUMP in time and the recapping of all the loose story lines out there. I got the feeling that this was closure to Elm Creek Quilts-- without telling the fans who have read all 17 books that this was happening. I would have rather read a book about the Aloha Quilt Camp and experience the wedding first had. I would have rather read a book about how Sylvia found her California relative and the story there. I got the feeling that Jennifer Chiaverini was tired of the story lines and just closed them in a few paragraphs of remembering. And the twins, it would have been fun to follow them through their growing up and explore the relationships of a daughter not interested in quilting and son who was. Sigh, I will await what is next, but, I really would like to know Jennifer's thinking on this one.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Initial thoughts (186 pages read) - I wonder why this novel was written almost entirely as a recap of the past 20 years. It is set in the future, with Sarah and Matt's twins grown up and the daughter getting married. Instead of the novel focusing on the wedding, or the events leading up to the wedding, it is telling the story of every single Elm Creek quilter over the past 20-30 years. It's an odd way of telling the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final thoughts - My initial opinion still stands. Way too much flashback, very little plot connecting the thread of stories. It was an ok book, just not good. I found myself skimming, trying to get back the actual wedding. If these stories needed to be included in the series, they should have taken up several additional books instead of cramming 25 years of back story into one novel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the inclusion of future details was odd. It sounded like, in only the next 25 years, the US will have adopted universal health care, much increased pay for teachers, completely rechargeable cars, and survived a huge environmental crisis. These details were interjected into the story and played no relevance to the plot, but they weren't elaborated on. Too much of a teaser. The story could have been set in 2011 without the mention of these futuristic changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm bummed. I was the fifth or sixth person at my library to read this book. I wanted it to be all about quilting, sharing more of the intimate lives of some of my favorite characters. Sadly, those two aspects were completely lacking.\n",

      "This is the 18th book in the Elm Creek series.\n",

      "I have read them all and in order but I will admit when I started this one I was a little lost as so many years had past since the last one. Once I understood that I enjoyedhte walk down memory lane in this book, while learning some new pieces to the puzzle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sarah's daughter Caroline is getting married. This is the book of everyone coming back together for the wedding and as we do this Sarah has a few walks donw memory lane. To me it was sort of a remonder book of what has gone on in the past books and really I was grateful. I read a lot of books and as these only coming out yearly, it is hard to remember everyone and everything.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I believe that this is the worst book that Chiaverini has ever written. I normally adore her books and eagerly wait for the next title to be released.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will not reveal the plot, but I will say that I did not like the futuristic twist or the flashbacks. I thought that the story was aburd and difficult to follow.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Ever since I first read The Quiter’s Apprentice I have been a big fan of the Elm Creek Quilt series. I really enjoyed the characters that Chiaverini had created and looked forward to visiting with them in each new book. Then the author detoured into other time periods and began writing about other quilters, most notably Sylvia’s cousin, Elizabeth, who moved to California during the Prohibition Era and their Civil War era ancestors, Anneka and Gerda. At first, even the books that explored other eras also featured the original Elm Creek Quilters (for example when Sylvia discovers Gerda’s memoirs, the book alternated between Gerda’s story and the story of Sylvia discovering and reacting to this new bit of family history and its implications) but as the series progressed, the author neglected her original characters more and more,. I was frustrated by this because A) I loved the original characters so much and B) Chiaverini had left a lot of unresolved plot points dangling in the current timeline: including the integration of several new Elm Creek Quilters, several couples in the process of coming together or growing apart, and Sarah pregnant with twins.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was excited to read The Wedding Quilt because we were finally going to visit with my favorite characters and see what they had been up to. And now that I have finished the book, I am sorry to say that I was very disappointed. The book takes place 25 years in the future when Sarah daughter (who we haven’t even met yet before now) is getting married. As a result, the book bounces back and forth between Sarah getting ready for the wedding and reminiscing about everything that has led up to this point. The jump ahead to the future was incredibly annoying. The little futuristic touches that Chiaverini throws in (from the new kind of gaming console that Diane’s son, Michael, invented to the social changes just came across as silly or preachy or –like much of this book – half baked afterthoughts). The story, itself, is presented in a series of flashback and summaries, usually in the same tone and with the same amount of depth and development that the author uses when recapping information from past books. The birth of Sarah’s twins, the passing of several beloved characters (including Sylvia and Agnes) are all glossed over without any real emotional impact which is almost disrespectful to the characters we have come to care for over the series. And Chiaverini rushes through several romantic relationships with a callous “lets-just-jump-to-the-end” attitude that was just completely unsatisfying and annoying.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the author had run out of things to say about this particular group of characters but was feeling some pressure to wrap up their stories for the fans, I could maybe begin to understand why the author wrote this half-hearted perfunctory book but there were several plot points that easily could been developed into much more satisfying books or Hall integrated with another book to provide a more interest counterpoint between the characters in this timeline and those from an earlier era. (The storyline of Agnes trying to save the historic Union Hall would have made a nice counterpoint to the events of The Union Quilters which told of how the hall was created and would have given the author the opportunity to visit with characters from both the past and the present). All in all, I am beginning to get a little disenchanted with the series and if something doesn’t change in the next few books, I have to say that I am more likely to re-read one of the earlier books than pick up one of the new ones.\n",

      "The story may have had some merit however the writing style was so archaic and verbose that it took 50 words to complete a sentence. After trudging through about 100 pages he never came to any points or conclusions other than some people can remember what they ate 20 years ago in detail. This guy (Nathaniel Hawthorne) could have competed with Marry Shelly for the most long-winded of the year. Some of it may not be his fault due to the writing style of the time but we surely do not have to put up with this.\n",

      "The Scarlet Letter: A Romance is a work of historical fiction by American author Nathaniel Hawthorne, published in 1850. Set in the Puritan Massachusetts Bay Colony between the years 1642 and 1649, the novel tells the story of Hester Prynne.\n",

      "Another novel adapted into movies and lesson heard across the world. Seen as a novel supporting feminism Hawthorne writes about the triumphs a young lady is faced when she’s left to bear the letter A on her garments as a sign of Adultery though it is not her that commits it. This novel goes beyond its years as it defies societal wicked views on women and unaccountability for men.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This book was okay but it did not really catch my interest mainly because of the way it was written with descriptions going on and on and because it is written in old English which I don't really like reading to well. The Scarlet Letter takes place in New England sometime around the mid 1600's when New England was still under Great Britain's rule. The book follows the life of Hester Prynne a young woman who has commited adultery against her husband and then kept the child and raised it, for her consequence she had to wear a scarlet A on the breast of her dress for the rest of her life, the A stands for adultress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through out the book the people in the small village where Hester Prynne lives usually ignore her and some of the kids in town throw stuff at her when ever they see her, people think that her child may be damned since it is a result of the sin she commited and Hester will also not tell who the daughters father is which puts her in even more shame at the eyes of the towns people. A man who has been calling himself Roger Chillingworth is Hester's long lost husband and reveals his identity to her and states that it was a mistake to marry a girl like Hester.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story goes on for many years and the daughter of Hester who's name is Pearl grows up into a child and later Chillingworth finds out that minister Dimmesdale is the father of Pearl after he has noticed that Dimmesdale has been suffering heart problems from his own torture of knowing about the act he had commited and Chillingworth also found some writing that stated the fact. Afterward Dimmesdale is seen linking hands with Hester and Pearl as a meteor marks a big red A in the sky, the towns people think the A stands for angel but it really stands for adultery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dimmesdale, Hester and Pearl plan to run away to Europe together but right before they set sail Dimmesdale gives a sermon and confesses to the sin he has commited and dies within Hester's arms right after Pearl kissed him. Chillingworth also dies shorly after and Hester and Pearl leave the small village, later in life Hester returns to live in her small cottage and Pearl has gotten married and started a family of her own. When Hester passes away she is buried and on her tombstone is an A for her and Dimmesdale.\n",

I enjoyed the detective parts of this and the action reads as if straight out of a movie which is were the problem comes in by the second book the action becomes the primary focus and not the mystery so my enjoyment of the book declined as the book become an action/adventure as opposed to a film noir type SF book. Still worth the read and love the idea of the Moreaus.\n",

      "Reflecting on my reading year 2016, I came to think of books that have meant a lot to me over the past decades, and the first one that came to my mind was Gombrich’s excellent introduction to art history.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will have to go back twenty years, half my life, to the year 1996. I am twenty years old, and just about to discover the pleasurable adventure called university. For Christmas, I receive a much longed-for gift card to buy books that “will help me in my studies”, and I stand in a bookstore, one of those exquisite, inexhaustible bookstores on several floors that German university cities provide, and I am browsing through options. I probably spend hours there. I can still feel the time pass, while I look, think, go through history, art, literature. I pick a book, then another one, and more still, until I have to bring one back. Gift card value is weighed against all these lovely, lovely possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment in time, I own one Billy bookshelf, and it is not filled yet, as my children’s books and classics are left at my parents’ house. What do I pick? I don’t remember the fiction, but I do remember picking a “start of the term offer”, Mayersches Taschenlexikon, in 34 volumes, rarely used, as the internet takes over soon, and it is inconvenient to look up definitions by going through entries in alphabetical order. Some time between 1996 and now, it falls victim to one of our many moves between cities and countries. I don’t have it anymore. I bought it out of duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "I choose one extravaganza: Gombrich. A German hardback copy, beautifully illustrated, taking a huge chunk of the gift card money. I start reading as soon as I come home. And almost magically, it opens up the world of art to me. I learn why Egyptians “walk like Egyptians”, I discover Rubens, Bernini, Raphael, Leonardo, and Delacroix,and Canova, Manet and Monet, and Picasso, Duchamp and, and, and...\n",
      "\n",
      "I discover the world through a visual prism. Ever since then, Gombrich has followed my path. I soon come to read his more specialised works on form, function and symbolism in Renaissance art, I learn about his life, deeply influenced by 20th century history, and I keep going back to “The Story Of Art” whenever I need to take a step back and look at general ideas again.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I steal my mother’s Swedish copy!\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to read it aloud to my children, and they are only used to their father reading in German, and me in Swedish. So in order not to confuse them more than necessary in their Babylonian curse, I read it in Swedish, the stolen goods. And what a help that has been in the many museums around the world that my children have visited over the years. They recognise their “Gombrich” when they see it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two years ago, my eldest son wants a copy - in English, in order to be able to quote from it. And of course I can’t resist buying it for him, at a shop inside the British Museum. So we have three copies, and I would not be beyond buying one in French, at a shop in the Louvre, maybe, just for the silliness of owning a favourite in so many different shapes. For they are all slightly different in layout, but equally satisfying visually and textually.\n",
      "\n",
      "I still recommend it to whoever wants a clear, concise, lovable account of the history starting with cave paintings in Lascaux, and moving forwards still, mirroring humanity in its need to express ideas, thoughts and feelings through the medium of art.\n",
      "\n",
      "My children and I will now be reading , which Gombrich wrote expressly for children, and YES - we read it in Swedish. And YES, we have it in English as well!\n",
      "\n",
      "And NO - one Billy bookshelf is not even enough for our children’s books anymore!\n",

      "إذا حاولنا أن ننسى كل ما سمعناه عن العشب الأخضر و السماء الزرقاء و نظرنا إلى العالم و كأننا وصلناه توا من كوكب أخر. و شاهدناه أول مرة. فقد نجد أن الأشياء يمكن أن تتخذ ألوانا غير متوقعة. و الرسامون يشعرون أحيانا أنهم يقومون برحلة استكشاف كهذه. إنهم يرغبون في رؤية العالم رؤية جديدة.\n",
      "\n",
      "يوجد شكل ما من الفن في كل مكان من العالم. غير أن قصة الفن بوصفها جهدا متصلا لا تبدأ من كهوف جنوب فرنسا أو بين هنود أمريكا الشمالية. فليس هناك تراث مباشر يربط هذه البدايات الغريبة بأيامنا. و لكن هناك تراثا مباشرا انتقل من المعلم إلى التلميذ. و من التلميذ إلى المعجب أو الناسخ. و هذا التراث يربط الفن في عصرنا. يربط أي منزل أو أي ملصق بالفن الذي نشأ في وادي النيل منذ خمسة آلاف عام خلت. و نحن سنرى أن معلمي الإغريق قد قصدوا مصر للتعلم. و نحن جميعا تلاميذ الإغريق. و على هذا فمصر بالغة الأهمية لنا.\n",
      "\n",
      "ظل الفن يدور في نفس دائرته التقليدية أكثر من ثلاثة آلاف سنة لم يقطعها إلا ثورة اخناتون للإصلاح الديني التي أتت بأساليب فنية جديدة أيضا إلا أن فشل حركة الإصلاح جعلت الفن يعود مرة أخرى لقواعده الصارمة المقدسة التي لم يستطع الفنان المصري تجاوزه و انتظر العالم نحو خمسة قرون أخرى حتى انتقال الحضارة إلى الإغريق فكانت نقلة أخرى للفن و ان في إطار القداسة أيضا و لكن مع التخلي عن بعض المعايير التي فرضها الفنان المصري على عمله و حدت من ابداعه.\n",
      "\n",
      "الراجح هو أن الفن في هذا الوقت قد فقد إلى حد بعيد علاقته القديمة بالسحر و الدين. أصبح الفنانون مهتمين بالمشكلات الخاصة بالحرفة.\n",
      "\n",
      "في العهد المسيحي تراجع الفن مرة أخرى و غُلّت يد الفنان بسبب عودة ارتباط الفن بالقداسة فقد رأت الكنيسة أن الصور ليست فقط مفيدة بل مقدسة أيضا. و هكذا أخذ البيزنطيون يصرون مثل المصريين على مراعاة التقاليد مراعاة صارمة.\n",
      "\n",
      "أما الإسلام فقد حظر صنع الصور و لكن الفن في حد ذاته لا يمكن قمعه بسهولة. لذلك فإن حرفي الشرق الذين منعوا من تصوير البشر. تركوا خيالهم يتلاعب بالأشكال و التصاميم و أبدعوا أدق أعمال الزخرفة المعروفة بالأرابيسك.\n",
      "\n",
      "أما في عصر النهضة فقد انصرف الفنان عن تقديس الفن و انصرف الناس عن لعنه أو تقييده و بدأت صفحة جديدة في محورين لا ثالث لهما: دراسة ما سبق من فن الإغريق و الرومان دراسة متعمقة و واعية. و استلهام الطبيعة و العلم لإحياء تلك الفنون القديمة في قالب جديد.\n",
      "\n",
      "أحدثت الاكتشافات التي قام بها فنانو إيطاليا و الفلاندر في بداية القرن الخامس عشر هزة في أنحاء أوروبا كافة. و الفكرة التي سحرت الفنانين و رعاة الفن على السواء هي أن ��لفن يمكن أن لا يستخدم من أجل رواية قصة مقدسة رواية مثيرة فحسب. بل من أجل عكس مقطع من عالم الواقع أيضا. و لعل أكثر نتائج هذه الثورة في الفن مباشرة هي أن الفنانين شرعوا في كل مكان في التجريب و البحث عن تأ��يرات جديدة و مدهشة. و هذه الروح المغامرة التي استحوذت على الفن في القرن الخامس عشر تحدد القطيعة الفعلية مع العصور الوسطى.\n",
      "\n",
      "الحق ان شكل العمارة الأوربية في القرن السادس عشر في عز نهضتها عندما اتجهوا إلى البساطة في التصميم و عدم التوسع في الزخرفة و الرسوم و النقوش البارزة و التماثيل الكثيرة اقترت كثيرا من نماذج العمارة المملوكية و التي برزت قبلهم بأربعة قرون على الأقل و هذا ظاهر بشكل واضح لكل من يرى نموذجين أحدهما من العمارة المملوكية و الأخر من آثار عصر النهضة إلا أن الكتاب لم يشير لأي رابط مباشر أو قريب بينهما.\n",
      "\n",
      "في نهاية القرن السابع عشر و مع حركة الإصلاح الديني في الكنيسة اكتشفت الكنيسة الكاثوليكية أن الفن يستطيع أن يخدم الدين على نحو يتجاوز المهمة البسيطة المحددة له في أوائل العصور الوسطى – مهمة تعليم الأميين مباديء العقيدة. كان من الممكن أن يساعد على اقناع الذين قرأوا كثيرا و هدايتهم إلى المسيحية. لذلك دُعي المهندسون المعماريون و الفنانون و النحاتون إلى تحويل الكنائس إلى صروح رائعة تملأ المرء مشاعر جارفة. و خصوصا في أثناء القداس الكبير حين تضاء القناديل على المذابح و تملأ رائحة البخور صحن الكنيسة و ينقلنا صوت الأرغن و الجوقة إلى عالم مغاير.\n",
      "\n",
      "في القرن التاسع عشر كانت ثورة فنية دائمة لا تبقي و لا تزر و اختلط فيها كل شيء بعد ان استقرت الأمور قبل ذلك بوقت طويل فقد بنيت الكنائس في الغالب على الطراز القوطي لأن هذا الطراز كان شائعا فيما يسمى عصر الإيمان. و بالنسبة إلى المسارح و دور الأوبرا فإن الطراز الباروكي المغالى فيه كثيرا ما كان يعتبر مناسبا. في حين كان يعتقد أن القصور و مباني الوزارات تبدو أكثر فخامة إذا بنيت على طرز النهضة الإيطالية.\n",
      "\n",
      "إن اتساع مجال الاختيار و الاستقلال عن نزوات الرعاة الذي كانت كلفة اكتسابه كبيرة. قد كان له فوائد أيضا. أصبح الفن و ربما لأول مرة وسيلة الفنان الكاملة للتعبير عن فرديته حقا. شريطة أن يكون للفنان فردية للتعبير عنها.\n",
      "و الفكرة القائلة أن الهدف الحقيقي للفن كان التعبير عن الشخصية لم تحرز تقدما إلا بعد أن فقد الفن كل هدف أخر.\n",
      "\n",
      "في الفن الحديث ظهرت و لأول مرة فكرة التضحية بالحقيقة في سبيل الفكرة. فالفنان لا يبالي كثيرا بأن تكون لوحته مشابهة للطبيعة في تفاصيلها بقدر اهتمامه بأن تظهر فكرته للجمهور. و هو هنا لا يتعمد تشويه الطبيعة و لكنه أيضا لا يبالي ان تشوهت.\n",
      "\n",
      "تعاظم شعور بعض الفنانين بأن الفن قد فقد شيئا في رحلة بحثه الطويلة. شيئا حاولوا محاولة مستميته أن يسترجعوه. شعر سيزان بأن ما فقد هو النظام و التوازن. و شعر فان جوخ بأن ما فقد هو الكثافة و العاطفة على حساب خصائص الضوء و اللون. و أخيرا كان غوغان غير راض تماما عن الحياة و الفن كما وجدهما. تاق إلى شيء أبسط أكثر مباشرة. و تمنى أن يجده بين البدائيين. إن ما ندعوه الفن الحديث قد صدر عن هذه المشاعر المستاءة. و الحلول المتنوعة التي تلمسها هؤلاء الفنانون الثلاثة قد أصبحت المثل العليا لثلاث حركات في الفن الحديث. إن حل سيزان قد أدى في نهاية المطاف إلى التكعيبية. التي نشأت في فرنسا. و حل فان جوخ إلى التعبيرية التي وجدت استجابتها الكبرى في ألمانيا. و حل غوغان إلى مختلف أنواع البدائية. و مهما بدت هذه الحركات مجنونة في البداية. فليس صعبا أن نبين اليوم أنها كانت محاولات متسقة للنجاة من الورطة التي وجد الفنانون أنفسهم فيها.\n",
      "\n",
      "السؤال التقليدي من الجمهور هو: إلام أريد لهذه الأعمال أن ترمز؟\n",
      "إن تلمس الجواب أسهل من تقديمه. لأن الأجوبة من شأنها أن تتردى إلى تبحر زائف. أو هراء بحت. و مع ذلك إذا كان لابد من قول فانا أفترض أن الجواب الصحيح هو أن الفنان الحديث تواق إلى خلق أشياء مع التشديد على لفظة خلق و لفظة أشياء. إنه يريد أن يشعر بأنه صنع شيئا لا وجود له من قبل. شيئا لا يكون مجرد محاكاة لشيء واقعي مهما كانت المحاكاة بارعة. و لا يكون مجرد زخرفة مهما كانت حاذقة. بل شيئا أوثق صلة بالموضوع. و أكثر ديمومة. شيئا يشعر الفنان بأنه أكثر واقعية من وجودنا المبتذل. و إذا أردنا أن نفهم هذا المزاج. علينا أن نرجع إلى طفولتنا. إلى زمن كنا فيه قادرين على صنع أشياء من الآجر أو الرمل. و على تحويل عصا المكنسة إلى عصا سحرية. و بضعة أحجار إلى قصر مسحور. كانت هذه الأشياء تكتسب في نظرنا دلالة هائلة. لعلها مثل دلالة الصورة في نظر البدائيين.\n",
      "\n",
      "كان الكثير من السرياليين متأثرين إلى حد كبير بما كتبه سيجموند فرويد الذي بين أن الطفل و المتوحش فينا يسيطران علينا عندما ترقد أفكارنا الصاحية. و ها هي ذي الفكرة التي جعلت السرياليين يعلنون أن الفن لا يمكن إبداعه أبدا في حالة اليقظة التامة للعقل. و لعلهم أقروا بأن العقل يمكن أن يعطينا العلم. و بأن اللاعقل فحسب يمكن أن يعطينا الفن.\n",

      "طی دومین خوانش اثر، نگاهی هم به مرورم بر این کتاب (که در انتهای همین نوشته قرار داده‌ام) انداختم؛ گرد و غبارِ غرور و نخوتِ ناشی از اینکه کنون خود را داناتر از آن زمانِ خود می‌دانم اجازه نداد عاری از تمسخر نوشته را بخوانم! مجال گفتنش در اینجا نیست، وگرنه سعی می‌کردم بلاهت خود و دیگرانی چون من را در این باره تشریح و تقبیح کنم! به هر صورت، همچنان با حسی که آن زمان از خوانش کتاب گرفته‌ام، اخت هستم و بسی خرسندم که برای آشنایی اولیه با هنر به این کتاب مراجعه کردم. طی دومین خوانشم، که بیشتر به سبب تحکیم حافظه و تلاش برای درک خیل عظیم آثاری که به‌‌خوبی درک نکردم، بود، نکات کلی بیشتری در باب اثر دریافتم که اینجا بازگو می‌کنم:\n",
      "1. خوشبختانه آثار صرفا معرفی نشده بودند، بلکه طی دوران تدریجی تاریخ، نویسنده تلاشی قابل تقدیر در راستای بیان نظریه‌های مهم درباب هنر و زیبایی کرده بود؛ حسن این کار زمانی مشخص می‌شود که با اثری غیر از آثار کتاب روبرو شده و با تعجب درمی‌یابیم که نویسنده چه خوب توانسته است طبعمان را در یان زمینه به‌خوبی پرورش دهد و خوب نگاه‌کردن (خالی از تعصب) را برای لذت از آنچه می‌بینیم یادمان داده است.\n",
      "2. قطعاً برخورد با حجم عظیم آثار در این مجلد کوچک هم موجب سردرگمی می‌شود، هم سبب می‌شود که پس از مدتی دیگر جز یادآوری خوانشِ کتابی که جز نامش هیچ از آن یادمان نیست، چیز دیگری برایمان نمانده باشد! خوشبختانه، نویسنده با قراردادن یک ویژگی در نوشته‌اش این مشکل را حل کرده است: ارجاع و مقایسۀ مکرر آثار با یکدیگر؛ تا جایی که گاهی اثری با بیش از ده نمونۀ دیگر مقایسه شده و ریشه‌های آن یافت شده‌اند. این به خودیِ خود درک سیر تحول هنرِ مورد بررسی در کتاب را آسان‌تر می‌کند؛ همزمان با این ویژگی، اینکه طی هر فصلی متوجه می‌شویم که چرایی خلق آثار چه بوده‌ است (با مقایسه و ارجاع)، ما را یاری می‌دهد تاحدودی متوجه شویم که اکنون نیز چرا خلق اثر هنری به این سمت و سو رفته است و دغدغه‌ها چه بوده‌اند.\n",
      "3. طی دومین خوانش دربارۀ ترجمه متوجه نکتۀ غم‌انگیز شده‌ام که البته با توجه به وضعیت نشر کتاب، مترجم و ناشر سزاوار سرزنشی نیستند؛ تصاویر بیش از آنچه فکر می‌کردم سانسور شده‌اند (به همین دلیل توصیه می‌کنم طی خوانش کتاب حتما آثار را در اینترنت جستجو کنید) و در برخی قسمت‌ها، از برخی هنرمندان نام برده شده است بی انکه اثری از آورده شده باشد که با سیر کلی کتاب و نگارش متن بر اساس تصاویر در تضاد است؛ بنابراین می‌توان دریافت که احتمالا برخی آثار نیز در مجموع حذف شده‌اند (که البته با توجه به اینکه نسخۀ اصلی کتاب را نداشتم، آنچه بیان کردم تنها یک احتمال می‌ماند).\n",

      "کتاب از بیست هشت فصل تشکیل شده و طی این فصل ها نویسندۀ گرامی، داستان هنر را از عصر غارنشینی تا پایان سدۀ بیستم بررسی می کند؛ تأکید میکنم داستان هنر نه تاریخ آن! زیرا اولاً نام اصلی کتاب، داستان هنر است و دوم آنکه شیوۀ بیان سرگذشت هنر توسط آقای گامبریج، حالتی بسیار داستان گونه و گرم دارد، نه بیانی سرد و تاریخی از سیر هنر طی سالیانِ تمدن بشر و قبل از آن؛ اما بنا به این که در قسمت های زیادی از کتاب کلمۀ تاریخ تکرار شده، مترجم تصمیم گرفته نام اثر را تاریخ هنر نهد، که همان عنوان اصلی بنظرم مناسب تر بود. غیر از این مورد، ترجمه بسیار مناسب بود و مشکلی نداشت.\n",
      "فصل آخر کتاب به مرور زمان، طی چند ویرایش به کتاب اضافه شده و بنظرم از بهترین بخش های این کتاب بود؛ زیرا برخلاف سایر فصل ها که نویسنده فقط داستان هنر را بیان کرده بود و کمتر نظرات خود را در متن جا داده بود، در این فصل کامل، شیوا و خلاصه نظریات خود را دربارۀ هنر مدرن و پست مدرن، مشکلات هنر در عصر جدید و مسائل این چنین ابراز می کند که براستی نشان دهندۀ نگاه خرمندانۀ ایشان است؛ البته منظورم از بیان این مطلب، بیان ضعفی در رابطه با سایر فصل ها نبود، اصلاً! همانگونه که خود نویسنده نیز در ابتدای کتاب گفته است، هدفش از عدم طرح دغدغه ها و نظریات خود در خلالِ بیانِ سرگذشت هنر، نگاهی بدون جانبداری به این آثار بوده است که از منظری نقطۀ قوت کتاب و این فصول نیز می باشد.\n",
      "\n",
      "به شخصه عاشق شیوۀ نگارش کتاب شدم؛ اینکه مسئله ای تاریخی را بدون شخصیت پردازی و تنها با صرف گزارش تاریخی، این چنین جذاب بتوان بیان کرد، براستی قابل تقدیر است. مطالب کاملاً به هم پیوسته هستند و همۀ مطالب یک فصل بدون سرتیتر در ادامۀ هم آمده است؛ که به عقیدۀ من باعث شده خواننده متوجه نشود که چگونه نویسنده مطلب را از هنرمندی (یا اثری یا مکتبی) به هنرمندی دیگر (یا اثر یا مکتبی دیگر) جهش می دهد. تا این حد از پیوستگی و انسجام منظورم بود! این مسئله به فهم مطلب نیز بسیار کمک کرده است، چون در هر حال، عادی است که بیان این حجم از اطلاعاتِ هنری و مطالبی که شاید بسیاری از خوانندگان با آنان هیچ آشنایی ندارند (مثل من که برای آشنایی با هنر این کتاب را مطالعه کردم)، پس از مدتی ملال آور شود، اما مطلب به گونه ای زیبا روایت شده که صفحات پشت سر هم ورق زده می شوند، بدون آنکه خواننده متوجه شود؛ این جذابیت مطلب (به تعبیری دیگر، ملال آور نبودن نوشته) خود باعث شده، تمرکز خواننده روی اسامی، سبک ها و آثار تا حد زیادی باقی بماند و آنها را فقط از مقابل دیدگانش نگذراند.\n",
      "\n",
      "طبیعیست با خواندن کتابی که دارای بیش از چهارصد تصویر از شاهکارهای هنری جهان، دوبرابر این مقدار نام هنرمند، طرز فکرشان و اطلاعاتی دربارۀ تمامی سبک های هنری فاخر تا قرن بیستم است، احساس کنیم که ؛ اما اینگونه نیست. شاهکار نویسنده اینجا مشخص می شود! بعد از حدود صد صفحه که شامل مقدمه و تاریخ هنر در باستان می شود، نویسنده تقریباً تمام آثاری را که بررسی کرده، با هنر باستان و سایر قسمت های کتاب مقایسه می کند؛ این فلش بک ها باعث می شوند درکی کامل و درست از طرز فکر غالب هر عصر و هنرمندان آن داشته باشیم، بتوانیم آثار دوره های مختلف را تشخیص بدهیم و زیبایی هایشان را بشناسیم، صرفاً فقط نام هنرمندان بزرگ و آثارشان را برای مدتی در ذهن نداشته باشیم بلکه تا مدت ها این آثار در ذهنمان ماندگار باشند و به مرور طی کتاب یاد بگیریم که چگونه زیبایی را در تمامی سبک های هنری ببینیم در عین حال که به مکتبی خاص تعلق خاطر داریم؛ مورد آخر به گفتۀ آقای گامبریج، یکی از اهداف مهمش از نگارش این کتاب بوده و به خوبی توانسته از عهده اش برآید.\n",

      "درباب کتاب: قبل از هرچیز باید بگویم چون این کتاب، اولین تجربه ام در زمینۀ مطالعۀ هنر است (که حقیقتاً تجربۀ لذتبخشی بود!)، شاید نتوانم به خوبی نواقص کتاب را بیابم و تنها مسحور زیبایی کتاب شده باشم؛ اما در هرحال با اندکی دقت هم خواننده متوجه می شود که اطلاعات کتاب در برخی قسمت ها می لنگد؛ برای مثال، در فصل پنج کتاب، هنر اسلامی و بودایی و سایر ادیان شرقی را بررسی کرده است؛ انتظار داشتم این فصل بسیاری مفصل تر از اینها باشد؛ عملاً مطلب خاصی دربارۀ معماری اسلامی و خاور دور (با آن سازه های زیبا و مسحور کننده شان) وجود نداشت! همچنین متأسفانه بسیاری از سازه های هنری تاریخی را مثل معماری و هنر آزتک ها و مایاها، آثار باستانی ایران، هنر در روسیه و به میزان کمتری شرق دور را بسیار کم بررسی کرده بود؛ مواردی که گفتم تنها با اطلاعات عمومی اندک خودم در رابطه با این سرزمین ها بود؛ چه بسا فردی متخصص موارد این چنینی بسیار بیشتری بیابد. قطعاً بودن این آثار و توضیح در رابطه با آنها هم برای خواننده لذتبخش بود و هم می توانند بر اطلاعات او مفید باشند، کما آنکه این آثار هنری قطعاً تأثیر شگرفی بر داستان هنر در طول تاریخ گذاشته اند.\n",

      "Islington took the best part—and cut all the unnecessary bloating—of Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan, maintained the inspirations he got from Sanderson’s , and Islington added his own twists and originality into this highly ambitious debut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three years. was recommended to me by my co-blogger, TS, for the first time in January 2017, and I have never gotten around to it until now. Honestly, the only excuse I had for postponing reading this series for so long—even though I shouldn’t—was because of the famous cliffhangers endings of each book in the series that I’ve heard of, and I was waiting for the series to be completed. For the past three years, I’ve been hearing that if you love and Sanderson’s books, you’re going to love this trilogy, and they’re not wrong. For clarification, I’m not even a fan of , I have DNFed the series upon finishing the fourth installment, and I’m not sure when I’ll get back to it. I do, however, consider Sanderson as one of the greatest fantasy authors of all time. If you’re a fan of either or Sanderson’s work, or maybe both, I think you have a great chance of loving this debut; I certainly did.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I found to be the most impressive in was the level of details, planning, and complexities that Islington has put carefully into his storytelling, and to think that this is his debut and just the first book of the trilogy! The book did start in a similar way to a lot of other epic fantasy series—especially —but the story did a corkscrew on me relatively faster, and Islington never lets up from there. “There’s always another secret,” Kelsier from said, and this seems to be the advice that Islington took into account the most with his plotting. Throughout my entire time reading this novel, I was constantly guessing and theorizing in my head; Islington made sure that with each new answer revealed, more questions will be raised as a replacement. However, what furthered my enjoyment was how everything felt like a gradual process that never felt overwhelming to read. I seriously didn’t expect the story in would become this complex, but I never felt lost because Islington prioritized learning each new element and revelations through his character’s perspectives rather than telling them in an awkward inner-monologue info dump that has happened in many other fantasy books.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also loved reading all chapters of the four main POV characters, which I realized have started becoming a rare occurrence the more I read. Usually, when I read a multi-perspective narration epic fantasy, there tend to be one or two POV characters that infuriated or bored me; in the worst-case scenario, some even felt like they didn’t need any POV chapters. That isn’t the case here; Davian, Wirr, Asha, and Caeden are all utterly crucial to the overarching storyline, and I had a blast reading every single one of their development. None of these characters were infuriating to read, and the importance of friendship, trust, and loyalty that Islington put into the main character’s motivations felt genuine and believable. These characters are plunged into deadly conflicts of ever-increasing proportion incredibly fast, and almost all of the characters here are morally grey and more than meet the eye; everyone has their own distinctive background, secrets, and motivations that drove them that I immensely enjoyed reading.\n",
      "\n",

      "It’s ridiculously hard for me to recall a fantasy debut that is as complex, engaging, and accessible as . I could mention by Jenn Lyons which I read in January 2019, and that book certainly doesn’t pale in complexity, but I felt that Lyons’s debut was trying to do too much that it loses the necessary quality of coherence. The details of world-building can be ultra-complex and the scope of lore could be massive but in the end, everything’s pointless if your readers can’t understand what’s going on. Thankfully, exposition is one thing that, in my opinion, Islington did extremely well. As I mentioned earlier, in this book we learned things together with the characters who, at first, also felt lost by the barrage of unfolding events. The in-depth and intricate magic system was brilliantly written; the vast scope of the history of the world was implemented precisely. and Sanderson’s influences are very apparent in many aspects of the world-building, but I think that Islington was able to successfully made the world of his series felt refreshing and original.\n",

      "There weren’t any major issues I found during my time of reading this book, as long that you know what to expect, I do think is a book that can be enjoyed by many epic fantasy readers whether they’re newcomers or veterans of the genre. My minor nitpicks would be that there were a few instances where Islington’s writing felt a bit choppy or awkward in the first half of the book. There were also a few phrases that felt repetitive; for example, the distracting phrases “he/she let out a breath he/she hadn’t realized he/she’d been holding” was repeated four or five times throughout the novel. However, miraculously, the quality of Islington’s prose improved significantly in the second half of the book. Islington has a writing style that’s simple, immersive, and super engaging; it reminded me of the best that Jordan has to offer in his series IF only he would stop emphasizing repetition, smoothing skirt, tugging braid, and sniffing. Seeing the escalating quality of Islington’s prose in this book alone, I’m sure that the next books won’t have the same minor issue I faced in the first half of this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "The majority of fantasy debuts I’ve read for the past two years—even those that I incredibly loved—have mostly been pretty straightforward in their narrative. offers a multi-layered and intricate world to dive into; most importantly, it is an immersive, accessible, and superbly entertaining classic fantasy written with a modern narrative. I can’t possibly describe how excited I am to be diving into the next two books as soon as I can; I didn’t plan this, but I’ll be binge-reading this series for sure. Too many questions demanding an answer right now, and I doubt I could be able to concentrate on reading something else until I found all the answers. From the first book alone, I already have a very good instinct that will end up being included in one of my favorite trilogies of all-time list when I’m done reading it, and I shall proceed to test whether my gut feeling will be proven or not.\n",

      "I received a review copy of The Shadow of What Was Lost in exchange for an honest review. I would like to thank James Islington and Orbit Books.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin with, I really thought this was going to be a \"run of the mill\" chosen one in a magic school sort of fantasy adventure. Thankfully only about 5-10% takes place at said establishment and the rest embraced a pretty awesome and beautifully depicted fantasy world. It still gives off the \"chosen one\" vibe throughout but that trope doesn't bother me if it's done well. Following on from a previous war, magic-wielders are controlled by 4 tenets. 4 rules which limit their power and where and how it can be used. It took a while for me to really appreciate the main 3 characters, Davian, Wirr, and Asha. When I did though, I analysed how they were really well fleshed out especially as they are only in their mid to late teens. They are highly likeable and although they traverse tragic emotional directions throughout, they are a joy to follow. In Islington's debut, things do not always go as planned for anyone, especially the magic-wielding Gifted. There are many deaths, lots of battles, and stalking shadow-beings. There are two types of magic. Essence, which is from the Brandon Sanderson school of magic schemes and a more mysterious, banned art used by the Augurs. We find out more about this later on in the book as a main character learns it for himself. Islington acknowledges himself that he wrote this after reading the Mistborn series and similarities are evident but this isn't a parody or a carbon copy. It's one of my favourite epic fantasy series since The Stormlight Archives and The Faithful and The Fallen which speaks volumes! I'd say that a mix of those two juggernauts of fantasy reading is a good general depiction to describe Inslington's work. Characterisation is strong throughout and even though some individuals' motives are foggy at best it makes for a scintillating reading experience. Characters outside of the main 3 such as Caeden, a powerful young man whose memory has been wiped, Taeris, a scarred mage who has followed Davian's life closely, and Aelric, a fine swordsman really help to bolster the piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "We travel throughout a good proportion of the world and the cartographed map was really helpful to set my bearings straight to follow the action. At 693-pages this is a lengthy endeavour but I was never bored and in fact, I kept thinking about when I could go back to the story and read it next. This opening in the Licanius Trilogy was a pleasant surprise and I'm sure Islington will become one of fantasy's heavyweights. I'm keeping this review short and not divulging too much information regarding the plot as I don't wish to spoil anything. I will say that when certain characters get split up and then didn't even know whether their friends were still alive that I was gripping the book intensely, glaring down at the pages begging Islington that they will meet again. A book has succeeded for me when it has me that emotionally engaged and engrossed. This is a brilliant opening chapter in what will undoubtedly be a damn fine fantasy series. It's highly detailed, very well written, and although death and gore are frequent, it contains a bit more hope than most stories currently around in this 'grimdark-era' offer. The Shadow of What Was Lost is emotionally engaging and the characters are great to follow, support, threat over, and care about. Now that I've finished this review I can start reading An Echo of Things to Come... this series is that addictive that I just need to know what happens next.\n",

New myths, new gods/priests, new stories must be told to justify and establish, reassure and mollify the people whose ideological or religious supports have been pulled out from beneath them.

      "Curiously enough, while all this innovation was going on, in Athens one of the most damaging epithets was \"innovator.\" So the men who willed the demotion of the Aeropagus, led by Ephialtes (who was later murdered for his trouble), had to argue that the Aeropagus had usurped its powers (quite false) and thus the removal of the aristocrats from the center of power was a return to the (even more false - but we all know that democratic decision-making has precious little to do with the truth). The Athenians needed a more efficacious justification for this change. They also needed a soothing of the many riled spirits brought about in the populace by all these changes. In the (***) first performed in 458, Aeschylus did all of this and much, much more.\n",

      "At the end of the Trojan War, Agamemnon returns victorious to his palace. But ten years earlier, in order to thwart the will of Artemis and still the fierce winds keeping the fleet on the Greek shore, he had sacrificed his daughter, Iphigenia, and his wife, Clytemnestra, has neither forgotten nor forgiven. She slays him horrifically, and now it is their son, Orestes, who is obliged by the received morality to revenge his father by killing his mother. High drama and madness ensues, but behind all that excitement is the structure of Aeschylus' purpose - justify the new order, the new morality.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the very outset of the trilogy the chorus recalls that even the gods have changed and changed again, from the rule of Ouranos through that of Kronos to Zeus with son killing father before the father could do the same to the son. And one cannot be sure of doing the right thing by obeying a god, since the gods themselves disagree about right and wrong. Uncertainty has been established: perhaps the received ways are mutable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not going to try to summarize the complicated plot and recall the many striking characters. From this beautiful, moving and complex masterpiece I just want to draw out here the one theme I've been working on in this review. When Orestes kills Clytemnestra at Apollo's urging, the Erinyes, the Furies - representing the old order, the old morality - hasten to avenge the matricide by tearing Orestes apart. But Apollo and Athena, representing the new order and morality, intervene. The passages involving the Furies are particularly haunting, both dramatically and poetically. The new order is confirmed with a trial in which Athena casts the deciding vote - Orestes is acquitted. Athena convinces the Furies to accept the verdict, and they are then given a place of honor (though not power) and agree to ensure the city's prosperity. The old is replaced by the new, honored and bound into the all's well that ends well (except for the house of Atreus). Despite Aeschylus' efforts, Athens' new democracy did not last long, but that is another story...\n",

Agamemnon kills his daughter, his wife kills him. Her son kills her. But wait! Apollo sanctions his killing. Alas, the Furies do not. So now we have the older gods versus the new.

      "Murder, betrayal, revenge, torment . . . you might wonder, “Why would I bother reading three Greek plays when I could see the same sort of lurid problems on an episode of Jerry Springer? And fold laundry at the same time??” Two possible answers: First, you’re not going to get patricide, matricide, human sacrifice and unintentional cannibalism on daytime TV because we still draw the line somewhere, and you have to admit those are pretty dramatic. More importantly, though, along with the dysfunction in the House of Atreus comes a searing examination of guilt, retribution, and justice. It’s a lot of philosophical bang for your buck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first play in the trilogy, , sets up the conflict for the remaining two. Agamemnon returns home from the Trojan War to his wife, Clytemnestra, who has spent the last ten years plotting revenge because he sacrificed their daughter to appease a god at the outset of the journey. The verbal interplay at their reunion is the stuff of English majors’ dreams. Clytaemnestra’s subsequent murder of Agamemnon, with the help of a lover who has his own history with Agamemnon, is the stuff of Mafia dreams – though actually I’m only guessing on that one. However, Clytaemnestra’s revenge creates the conflict that drives the other two plays and generates the ethical conundrum Aeschylus ultimately wants to solve. For now Clytaemnestra’s son, Orestes, needs to avenge his father’s death . . . but what happens if you kill your own mother? And how is the cycle of revenge ever supposed to end??\n",
      "\n",
      "has Orestes debating what he should do, sort of like Hamlet, until the advice of his sister and the chorus women wins the day. . . and that’s when the excitement kicks up a notch. Clytaemnestra’s death at the hand of her son calls forth the avenging Furies — ancient goddesses of chthonic tradition who appear here as gorgon-like horrors, swathed in black, heads writhing with snakes. It’s so dramatic!! Also it’s fitting, for Clytaemnestra is like a Fury herself: in avenging her daughter’s death she acts within the old paradigm of blood ties that the Furies champion, wherein maternal claims are stronger than marital.\n",
      "\n",
      "So even though Orestes does his duty to avenge his father (in accordance with the current ethos), he’s pursed by snaky-haired horrors for killing his mother. Like his father, Orestes appears to be both an agent and a victim of fate, for in following the gods’ direction to avenge his father’s death, he both aligns himself with the Furies’ spirit of vengeance and becomes subject to it. Perhaps Orestes’ contradictory relationship with the Furies is Aeschylus’s commentary on a theology rife with snares and contradictions. In , Aeschylus resolves the problem, but his “solution” to the blood feud tradition is hardly unproblematic itself — read it and lose sleep! But you’ll know for sure why this is a masterpiece.\n",

      "The final movie was very loyal to the shooting script, with a few changes - lines improvised by the great cast or edited out before the shoot or during post production. The addition of several pieces by screenwriter Michael Arndt - including an introduction, scene notes on how the screenplay differs from the final film, and a comical piece on \"How to Write a Sundance Hit in Nine Easy Steps\" - makes this edition a thoroughly enjoyable read.\n",

      "Little Miss Sunshine by Michael Arndt\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Little Miss Sunshine is one of the best films of 2006, indeed, it was nominated for the Academy Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA in the category of Best Film of the Year and it won two Oscars and BAFTAs, for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role for Alan Arkin and Best Original Screenplay for Michael Arndt.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a fresh, creative, imaginative, entertaining, quirky, brave, worthwhile and amusing comedy-drama about a family that is often dysfunctional and yet finds a way to push together and support the Little Miss Sunshine aka the very precocious and talented Abigail Breslin, nominated for both the Academy Award and the BAFTA for her performance as Olive Hoover, the seven year old who wants to take part in a beauty pageant.\n",
      "Toni Collette is excellent in the role of Sheryl Hoover, who is often the only sensible adult character, who has to cope with the insecurity and wrong plans made by her husband, the suicidal brother Frank Ginsberg, the peculiar, funny, but outlandish and heroin addicted grandpa Edwin Hoover and finally, her son Dwayne, who has taken a vow of silence and has a breakdown half way into the narrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Richard Hoover is played by the always exceptional Greg Kinnear, and he has developed a self-help and self-improvement technique in nine steps- this seems to be a stab at the industry that is supposed to make one so much better, bring achievement, often with ease and unearthly speed, that is most often a delusion, a scheme to fleece and get money from naïve customers.\n",
      "The plan from the film might be feasible, even if it does not take off, Richard keeps calling the partner in this enterprise, Stan Grossman aka Bryan Cranston, without much success, because there is no signal for the telephony network, the man is absent and eventually, Stan says that the improvement technique would not work because of…its creator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank Ginsberg says that he is the best American expert on Proust and this is a phenomenal achievement, given that Marcel Proust is considered by many- including the undersigned- to be the greatest writer, at least on a level with William Shakespeare and his chef d’oeuvre is a very long, magical, glorious, resplendent and radiant saga.\n",
      "The Proust expert is homosexual- like his favorite author- he has just separated from his lover, and to this traumatic event one must add the fact that his rival has just been published and acclaimed as…Number one in the field of Proust!\n",
      "\n",
      "Psychology studies have shown that after coping with adversity and trauma, many people- probably most- experience Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, while some have the chance- and this is because they are more resilient- to have Post Traumatic Growth…it may be the case of Frank, but only later, because when confronted with this stress he tries to commit suicide.\n",
      "There is a funny scene, when he meets his colleague in a gas station, where he was asked by Grandpa Edwin Hoover- the memorable Alan Arkin- to get some nasty pornographic magazines, which Frank tries hard to hide while pretending he is doing very well and the truth is he is so depressed…\n",
      "\n",
      "The five adults and the girl are travelling to this beauty contest for children- a very inappropriate, offensive idea, which is rightly ridiculed and satirized by this film-and they try to come to terms with their issues, from drug addiction, through suicidal tendencies, vow of silence to feelings of inadequacy, failure.\n",
      "Initially, there are some tensions and conflicts, Frank is thinking that the scheme concocted by Richard- achievement in nine steps – is ludicrous, like most if not all quick solutions to serious problems- and he is right in that- but given his attitude towards life and desire to end it, the suicidal man is not the best role model either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grandpa Edwin is perhaps the most pleasant, amusing of all, in spite or because of his habits-, the heroin addiction has had him expelled from the institution where he had resided- he has a very good relationship and empathy with Olive and they share a room on the road.\n",
      "The van they use is an old model, legendary Volkswagen model- before they cheated on the value of the emissions of their cars- that has problems with the steering wheel, the horn and more seriously, cannot be moved from the parking spot unless everyone got out and pushed the car, only to run later and jump in the moving vehicle, offering spectators some very good moments, when the car cannot stop or the funny crew has to run for life after the yellow, good looking vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas, grandpa does not wake up one morning, in the motel where they had stopped along the road, they call the ambulance, but he dies at the hospital and they have to use the funeral services, burry him and that would mean losing the entry to the competition and all the effort with the failing van, the travelling for so many hundreds of miles would have been for nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they take a bold, outrageous decision to take the body, stealing it from the institution, place it in the trunk and they are very scared when a policeman stops them on the road and he insists on looking in the back, from where the porn magazines requested by the dearly departed fall to the ground and the lascivious man takes them away.\n",
      "Dwayne reaches a nadir when he learns that he cannot become an airplane pilot, as he had intended, because color blind are eliminated out front and he has a collapse, stops the van, starts shouting and says that he hates each one, only to be soothed and brought back on track by little Olive.\n",
      "\n",
      "They arrive at the weird, sick, unbelievable pageant for girls that are all dressed up, made up to look like adults, act, dance and sing for the bizarre, if not pathological pleasure of grownups that make such effort to create very disturbing, abusive ultimately premises for their children.\n",
      "There are unexpected developments and the film has some healthy, humorous, sensible messages, it is not just a complex comedy, but also a motion picture that is educational and thought provoking.\n",

      "I didn't like the movie and I didn't like the script. The movie is very faithful to the script so I guess it makes sense I didn't like both.\n",

      "I found the story to just be too \"normal\", sure it's a dysfunctional family in a road trip full of incidents and some moments of craziness, but for me that wasn't enough. There was never the point in the movie where I had to hold my breath on what would happen next. Same way, the characters although nice and sympathetic through their flaws didn't grab me enough to root for one in specific. I just really didn't care and at the end of the day that's what's really important. No movie can be very good to someone when this happens.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Little Miss Sunshine is one of my favorite movies, so it was fun to read how author, Michal Arndt, went about creating the characters and the plot and how he wrote the screen play.

      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "It all happened so quickly. It is an efficient but brief story about a dysfunctional and quirky family, as they travel to a beauty pageant for the non-beauty pageant like daughter. It didn't go deep enough to impact me emotionally, but it was comedy with an important message. I imagine it is a great film given the actors chosen for the parts.\n",

Her overbearing mother runs roughshod all over her and neither parent pays her much attention. They are relieved to get her off their hands by marrying her off to the lieutenant, and she is relieved to be away from . And she is also relieved that she will be married to a seafaring man who will be gone on his ship for months at at time.\n",

All the characters are believable and the secondary ones are just as great. Give this one a read soon if you haven't already.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Christmas Brides is a 2014 St. Martin's Publication. This Christmas anthology features authors: Suzanne Enoch, Alexandra Hawkins, Elizabeth Essex, and Valerie Bowman. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fine group of authors are featured in this collection of Christmas themed novellas. What could be more magical than falling in love at Christmas time?\n",
      "To start things off the wonderful Suzanne Enoch has a story about a runaway bride who finds safety in the arms a brawny highlander in “One Hot Scot”. My only complaint here is this story seemed shorter than the others. I do understand these are novellas, but this one seemed to go by too fast. Still a great story though- 3.5 stars\n",
      "\n",
      "The next story is “Once Upon a Christmas Scandal by Alexandra Hawkins. This yuletide story has a bit of danger to it as a young woman with a large dowry is now being pursued by many a fortune hunter. However, one of them may be more serious...and deadly than the others. Will Lady Ellen escape her fate and find true love instead?\n",
      "I liked the edge this one had and felt so bad for Lady Ellen being fawned over by all those insincere men. But, that was not all.. her very life was at stake. Thankfully, Lord Swainsbury arrives and while it's Ellen's dowry that initially attracts him, it's Ellen, and only Ellen he wants for the rest of his life. This one gets 4 stars\n",
      "\n",
      "The third story is “The Scandal Before Christmas” by Elizabeth Essex. Ian needs a bride...NOW! Someone who is a lady, but would be willing to marry him within a very short period of time. When he is introduced to Anne, a very shy woman past marriageable age, they agree to marriage for their own reasons, none of which is love. But, after a forced period of time in one another's company, they find love is not as impossible as they had originally believed. I really like this one a lot. The ending was so wonderful!! The sacrifice Ian made by arranging the hasty marriage, was repaid to him ten fold. 4.5 stars\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least is “It Happened Under the Mistletoe” by Valerie Bowman. This story has a light tone and was a really fun read. Oliver is being sought out by a very persistent lady bent on marrying a duke. When he seeks refuge in the silver closet, he realizes he is not alone. A young woman is also hiding from suitors..and her name is Cerian Blake. The pair device a plan to thwart their matchmaking friends and halt their pursuers in the process. Naturally, you know where this is headed. Before all is said and done a few tears are shed and some soul searching must be done, but all is well that ends well. A cute story with a great ending and a cute cat. 4 stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "The collection as a whole is one I would recommend adding to your holiday reading this year. The stories are short enough to fit into your reading schedule and are all very enjoyable reads.\n",
      "4 stars for the collection.\n",

      "A few months ago I went to visit my dad's family. I simply brought my laptop in case for some reason I should need it. I returned back to my house with not only my laptop, but two bags full of Terri Blackstock books from my (incredibly amazingly perfect) aunt. She promised me that I would fall in love, and she was right, because I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "I kicked off my adventures with Emerald Windows. I then continued on to the Newpointe 911 Series. I read each book in one day, and the entire series in 5. It absolutely was that good. Christian, thriller, mystery, suspense, romance... What more could you ask for? To top it off, the book was set in Louisiana, where I'm from. '\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After about the 60% mark I had narrowed down the culprit to two people, and then just a little later I had figured it out. What made me keep reading was the motive. It was odd, out there, unpredictable, but so realistic and legitimate. Eventually, you figured out who the perpetrator was, but until Mrs. Blackstock revealed the purpose, you honestly had no idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, I'll admit it. I'm a sucker for small towns. (If you read my review for At Home in Mitford, you'll probably gather that). The people (Especially Aunt Aggie and the Andy Griffith Show references), the buildings and setting, and even the events and how they were quaintly described. I realize not everyone enjoys this, but it pushed my enjoyment level for this series over the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've read few books centered in the south, but when I have, they murdered the accents. Thanks to Terri we now have a *mostly* correct representation of how we actually speak. I'm sure that, since she's from Mississippi, it helped.\n",
      "\n",
      "People were actually injured and killed, y'all! Which would be convenient since this was a murder mystery... But nevertheless, it wasn't a happy-go-lovely everyone-ends-up-ok story.\n",
      "\n",
      "What generally characterizes a shallow story is not that the basic plot is superficial, but that there is only one plot. It doesn't keep you interested. It can't, no matter how commendable the writer's creativity is with that single line. Blackstock weaves multiple issues throughout the story that all connect to one another, but are in and of themselves inherently different.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would ask you to read this if only for the appreciation you gain for our 911 personnel. It made me feel connected, in some way, to them. They were personable and endearing. I'll tell you the absolute truth, once I finished this series, I never saw cops, firefighters, detectives, or emergency medical workers in the same light. Through all the shootings and ambushes that have recently been taking place, my heart aches because of the knowledge and insight that this book gives into their personal pains and sacrifice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Eh. Pretty typical. Wife walks in on husband hugging a woman who had a hard day (she was a paramedic and multiple people had died on her watch). Wife see's it as unfaithfulness and they separate. Both of them want to get back together, but neither thinks the other does so they stay in misery... and on and on and on. I just felt that maybe a little more creativity was warranted because of how talented I know Mrs. Blackstock is.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 'preaching' in this book I didn't personally find disconcerting at all, but I've read and talked to several people who found it as a problem. Maybe it could just be integrated into the story a little better.\n",
      "\n",
      "That about wraps it up! Thank you, thank you, thank you, Aunt Cynthia. You're the sweetest (:\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I've read Terri Blackstock's more current novels. Interesting to go back to one of her earlier series. Her writing was just as good then. She is the top suspense writer.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Private Justice, there is a serial killer that is rapidly taking out victims. Policeman and Fireman work together to find the villain. The main characters in the story were fireman Mark Branning and his wife Allie. While the mystery is solved, there is focus on their relationship as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solid suspense novel.\n",
      "Review 3\n",

      "Another exciting thriller from Terri Blackstock. I wish I had the sequels on hand.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This was a great romantic suspense by Terri Blackstock. The suspense was great and building as the book progressed and the plot surrounding Allie and Mark was executed well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mark and Allie: At first I didn't like Mark. He didn't realise the relationship with Issie (not physical) was wrong and not pure and blamed Allie for all their marriage issues. I sympathized with Allie, but at some point felt for Mark as Allie made up her mind of what was going on between Mark and Issie and was not open to hear Mark out. It took a tragic incident for them to realise their marriage is worth fighting for. My opinion of Mark changed when I saw how he protected Allie from the killer and at what lengths he would go to keep her save. They way he also faced her parents, who hated him for what he did to Allie, also made me respect him, it was not an easy situation and he did not take the easy way out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The theme of always focusing on your first love (God) and trust Him came through strongly. When we take our eyes of Him we allow open doors which have negative effects, as shown through Mark and Allie. Also the message about God's grace and redemption was a strong theme for me at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suspense plot: Someone is killing fire wives. I was right on with my guess very early in the book.\n",
      "However, even though I knew who it was I didn't know why he did it, and to follow the clues and that process was still interesting.\n",

      "Reborn by C.C. Hunter is the first book in the Shadow Falls: After Dark spin-off and it's such a relief to be back in the comforts of the beloved Shadow Falls camp. Ever since I started reading the Shadow Falls books years ago, the camp has felt like home to me and reading this series is extremely comforting and always manages to put a smile on my face with it's clever snarky humor and surprising drama. Kylie, Miranda and Della feel like old friends and I was so happy to finally read from Della's point-of-view.\n",
      "\n",
      "Della is back at Shadow Falls and she's trying to come to terms with her own family history and her father. Della learns that her father has a brother that he never talks about and to make things worse, her father is convinced that she's doing drugs. Della's life gets even more complicated when she gets caught between Perry, her old crush, and Steve, the shapeshifter who is unreasonably cocky.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Shadow Falls books are extremely addicting and Reborn is no exception; the fast-paced nature of the plot coupled with the superb humor make this book a fun, enjoyable read. The humor has never been better and C.C. Hunter's latest just might be her best YA book yet. Forget all of the other paranormal books on the market, once you start the Shadow Falls series there's no stopping until you have read them all. Forget your work, your life obligations because it's impossible to wrench your attention from C.C. Hunter's books.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reborn is similar to the other Shadow Falls books in terms of plot structure, which means that there's never a dull moment. The plot is rich in romance, drama, mystery and hilarious banter that keeps readers hooked from start to finish. I've never been so addicted to a series like I am with the Shadow Falls books because there's always something to enjoy in them. There's just something so special about Hunter's novels and I truly hope that this series gets adapted into a TV series.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reborn is full of memorable Della quotes and scenes that fans of Shadow Falls will absolutely love. This is a perfect addition to the world of Shadow Falls and it was interesting to see the camp from a whole new perspective. This book was well-worth the wait and it managed to make my bleak week a thousand times better.\n",

      "This is one that’s easier to read in pieces, since it has many short stories/fables, and if I tried to get through too many in one sitting, I would lose focus. But I enjoyed the book and many of the stories. My favorite, or at least the most memorable for me, was the one of the monk who carried his thoughts with him for too long.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Kindness is a collection of Buddhist stories and teachings. The closest thing that comes to mind when trying to describe it would be like a book of Aesop's fables. The stories all have a message that the reader is supposed to take away from each of the stories. These are of course all tied to following Buddhism, but even those who aren't Buddhist can take away positive messages from this collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stories range from being only a couple pages long, to more involved stories lasting maybe ten pages or so. This variety can be kind of nice, but it can also be a little frustrating since you don't really know what the next story is going to be. This wasn't a big deal, but did make reading it out loud a little bit of an uneven experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will have to say that of the collection of Buddhist stories we've read, this one is probably the one I liked the best. It had a nice variety of stories from the Buddha and stories from various other monks some of which were outside of the Buddha's homeland of India. I felt this variety was a very nice aspect of the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not being Buddhist some of the setups for the stories are a bit strange to me, like Buddha being various animals in previous lives. Even in these cases the stories they're attached to will give you something positive to think about. So if you're looking for an introduction to some Buddhist stories that kids will also find enjoyable, this is a good place to start. It was one of my favorites of the three or four we read.\n",

      "I'm impressed by this collection of Buddhist ... almost fairy tales, or more like Aesop's fables. Since I've been studying Buddhist philosophy for 2 years at a meditation center, it was a real joy to recognize a number of the stories from my classes, elaborated upon with wonderful details. I will likely buy a copy for my nephew. I read this after discovering the book Tending the Heart of Virtue: How Classic Stories Awaken the Moral Imagination in Children. It's important to have stories to teach ethics to small people that focus on kindness and a heart brave enough to be good even when the going is tough.\n",

      "This used to be my least favorite of the three Young Royals novels I'd read (the other two being Mary, Bloody Mary and Beware, Princess Elizabeth). To twelve-year-old me, Catalina's life was boring by comparison because no one was trying to actually murder her - at least, not yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Catalina, Ferdinand and Isabella's youngest child, is sent to England to marry Arthur, Prince of Wales. But sickly Arthur dies a few months after the wedding. Catalina, now called Catherine, is now stuck in rainy England while her new family, particularly her father-in-law King Henry VII, try to figure out whether she should be sent back to Spain, having outlived her usefulness, or keep her around to marry Arthur's brother Henry when he comes of age. In the meantime, Catherine has to deal with running a household on a shoestring budget and keeping one step ahead of all the officials, both English and Spanish, who would like to undermine her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I enjoyed the book a lot more. Catalina-Catherine emerges as a character who might not be particularly shrewd, but has a strong moral center, and is assertive without being aggressive. This poor woman gave her heart to her narcissistic husband and he eventually took everything from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of the narcissistic husband, Henry has a POV in this book - third person, granted, but a POV all the same. Unfortunately, he doesn't emerge with much of his own personality. He just seems like a nice boy with a crush on his brother's widow. At this stage in his life, he did indeed apparently have a crush on Catherine, but Meyer's Henry still seems far too nice a boy to grow up into the tyrant we all know he became. Perhaps the passages about him are meant to be Catherine's projections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meyer gives lots of details about clothes and food, which bring you into the story in ways few other things could. (That cockentrice!). Her narrators all have a certain dignity which makes them believably royal. Catherine might be the finest example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, this is a very good book which I recommend warmly to all high-school and college girls who love European history. (I'd recommend it for boys, too, provided they don't break out in hives handling a book with the word \"princess\" in the title). Younger kids will probably be confused by all the court intrigues, and Catherine is repeatedly grilled about whether her marriage to Arthur was consummated (it wasn't) which might make awkward reading for a middle-schooler. I learned so much from this whole series.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "After watching The Other Boleyn Girl, for some reason Queen Catherine just seemed to fascinate her, and that's one of the reasons I decided to read this book. Now I feel really, really sorry for Catherine.\n",
      "She had many years of 'happiness' with Henry (according to this book) but she had such a ruff start, and a sad ending. All young girls dream of being a princess or queen, but for some reason I don't think that part never took really took quite the grip it did in other girls. When I played games I didn't care if I was a peasant or a princess (that I can remember). I guess it was because my older sister and I think sometimes my older brother kept telling how much it would stink to be royalty. This book reinforced that. It really would stink to be royalty from any country in Europe during this time.\n",
      "Now I am off to read about Cattherine's (although that's not really her real name is it? It's Catalina or something) daughter Mary in\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Excellent young adult introduction to Catherine of Aragon, and a quick read for parents who might want to discuss the novel with their children.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is the second book by Meyer that I read this year. The first was The Bad Queen. I wasn't as fond of that one as I am of Patience, Princess Catherine. I think Catherine of Aragon is one of the Tudor wives that gets pushed aside because Anne Boleyn is so much more interesting. This book is part of her Young Royals series, geared toward young adults.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meyer really brought Catherine to life, and you really liked her and felt sorry for her, because she was a pawn in so many ways between the Spanish and the English.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book also paints an interesting picture of the Henry, who we see first as the Duke Of York and then as the Prince of Wales when his brother Arthur dies suddenly. Henry is much more likable than I've found him when he became King Henry VIII. Meyer shows the sibling rivalry well and they come across as any other brothers, even though they are royals.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like Meyer's writing style. As much as I love authors like Jean Plaidy and Phillipa Gregory, sometimes the story can become really dry. With Meyer that's not the case. She humanizes these historical figures, making them down to earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are interested in historical fiction and like a more young adult approach to writing, Meyer's books are definitely for you.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The story does centralize more on Catherine’s life before she became Queen. If you’re a Tudor fanatic the story isn’t anything new, but different style of writing and the way Catherine is portrayed is always something interesting to read. The way Catherine is written in this book is well done and shows her gracefully turning into the strong woman she would become later in her life. You do see glimpses of the young naive girl who was used to being loved, and coddled by her mother and father. (Which is nice to see, there are some novels I have read where Isabelle and Ferdinand don’t even play a role in her upbringing, or are being portrayed as cold blooded parents).\n",
      "\n",
      "You immediately sympathize with Catherine and admire her strength to survive despite going into near total poverty and unable to provide for herself and her household - what I liked the most was although there were attempts of others trying to run her life, Catherine finally stands up for herself and says enough is enough and makes decisions on her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other main Royal characters aren’t really that big of a central role in this story. You do see a little bit of Arthur and Catherine, however not as much as I would have liked. However, what I saw more of was Catherine and her relationships with her Duenna, and her ambassador, which I thought was an interesting read as in other books I have read, none of that was really the main feature. I might also add...the book doesn’t have the intrigue, and drama of court life that fans of historical fiction would expect. Then again this book is meant for teens and is really just a ‘starter’ book for those wanting to get into Tudor fiction. So if you like all the drama and action of the court, you won’t really find it here. It could actually be rather dry for Tudor fans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it’s a great book for young adults who want to get started on their Tudor mania. Despite the way the order of the series is, I would actually suggest starting with Catherine as she was Queen first before the other Royals in the series.\n",

      "I still think this is one of the most perfect poems I know, and I was grateful enough to buy this book without further research to thank Hayden for giving me a poem that shows me how to feel for my own dad... The book has finally reached the top of my pile and I have discovered that he was an African-American poet, and converted to his wife's Ba'hai religion from his adoptive parents Baptist faith, so I read and (mis)interpret his work through this knowledge.\n",

      "In the introduction Arnold Rampersad suggests that the consciousness of violence is probably the most constant element in his work, whatever the theme. Many poems deal with Black history, both to work through and reflect on the violence perpetrated against Black people and to memorialise and celebrate some heroic figures like Frederick Douglass (who gets a sonnet here) and Sojourner Truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Violence is everywhere though; In 'The Tattooed Man' he says 'all art is pain/suffered and outlived'. Elsewhere art is from violence. In 'Zeus over Redeye' he gives eloquent, conflicted passion to protest against nuclear weapons couched in their absurd machismo: 'guarded/like a sacred phallic grove/Your partial answers reassure/me less than they appall'. His poem 'Perseus' ends\n",

How does this relate to the 'hero''s overflowing will-to-violence?\n",
      "\n",
      "Rampersad shows how Hayden's sense of 'the uses of violence' evolved over the course of his life, towards strong opposition. For example in his poem about Macolm X he celebrates the renunciation of racial hatred, and again in 'Words in the Mourning Time', he calls on us thus:\n",

Is Plato's cave', but also too harsh for me, because we put meaning into our paths by walking them, mirage led or no, (and there is nothing outside the cave for the wise old White man to bring back down to us. Their claims are lies.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps this 'pessimism' is best exemplified by Hayden's gently mocking poem 'Astronauts', in which he asks 'What is it we wish them/to find for us, as/we watch them on our screens?' Part of this scepticism may come from the amusement of a religious man with the childlike excitement of science setting out to find meaning far from the quotidian. Part of it may come from frustration with the White man's untroubled sense of himself as all humanity. In any case, his questions send us into ourselves for answers\n",

      "This review focuses specifically on Hayden's first collection: A Ballad of Remembrance (which for some weird reason isn't listed on its own on GoodReads).\n",
      "\n",
      "Ballad is as good a book of American poetry as there is. Period, no hyperbole. When I first read it, I focused on the towering epics of African American experience: \"Middle Passage,\" \"Runagate Runagate,\" and \"Frederick Douglass,\" with its admonition to approach freedom not as a rhetorical emptiness, but as something lived as deeply, and for as long, as needed. Over the years, I've broadened my appreciation to include the psychic/mythic explorations of \"The Diver\" and the deep blues of \"Homage to the Empress of the Blues,\" \"Night Death, Mississippi,\" and \"Mourning Poem for the Queen of Sunday.\" All of those stand up as well as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on this reading, I was deeply affected by the psychological and spiritual lyricism of the title poem--a nightmare vision of Mardi Gras that echoes against the sexual complications of \"Witch Doctor\"--and the autobiographical honesty of \"Those Winter Sundays, \"The Web\" and \"The Wheel.\" It's impossible to do justice to Hayden with an excerpt but, because it's been haunting me, I'll offer up the last several stanzas of \"The Web\" in which Hayden, echoing the spider poems of Whitman, Frost and dozens of others, descends into\n",

      "Discovering Robert Hayden's poetry has been a wonderful pleasure. This collection omits all or most of his first three books of poems (1940, 1948, and 1955), drawing from his middle and later books (1962 through his death in 1980). It's a slim book of roughly 90 poems, but their stylistic range is spectacular. Many of the poems (though not all) address themes of race, oppression, history, and identity. Many from the middle period poems are resolutely literary - not only are some of the words Hayden uses obscure, but the poems are packed with allusions to classical mythology, Biblical stories, and touchstones of western civilization generally. In his later poems, Hayden more often relaxes into spare or minimalist compositions, or into colloquial speech, or even stream-of-consciousness. A critical afterword by Arnold Rampersad remarks on the omnipresence of violence in Hayden's poetry; but at the same time, many of the poems present empathy or compassion as our best hope to balance and contain violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some favorite poems from this collection include: Electrical Storm; Those Winter Sundays (\"What did I know, what did I know/ of love's austere and lonely offices?\"); Middle Passage; Runagate Runagate; October; and Ice Storm.\n",

      "There is no way for me to do a sensible, scholarly review of this book or any of the books in the Clockwork Century series. All I can say is that I loved this, and that Ms. Priest had me before Marie Laveau but I squealed in delight when she appeared. I'm thrilled with the gentle, low-key touch of romance as well as the breathless action, and just delighted to pieces with the whole book.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Ganymede is the fourth addition to the Clockwork Century universe, coming after Boneshaker, Clementine, and Dreadnought (in that order)**–-all of which are centered around a steampunk alternate history in which the American Civil War has carried on for nearly decades longer than in real life. The story follows two main characters: former lovers Andan Cly, the air pirate fans got to meet first in Boneshaker, and Josephine Early, a biracial prostitute and Union spy who is new to the series.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Airship pirates, New Orleanian prostitutes, Texas Rangers, a submarine, spies, a Voodoo queen, zombis… has got them all. For those who have been following the series all along, we get the treat of seeing some past characters make appearances, though I won’t say who (besides Andan, of course). As for new characters, a particularly interesting one for me–-perhaps because of her mystery–-was the Voodoo practitioner Marie Laveau, who was based on the real-life figure. I really wanted to learn more about her, though. It’s a shame we didn’t get to see more of her in action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing I liked was the attention to detail that Priest showed when it came to the settings. You really get the sense that she knows these places: Seattle, New Orleans, the swamps. Maybe at times we got just a little too much description–-how many scents can the human nose really pick up on all at once?–-but I did appreciate it nonetheless. Also, Priest gives us a lot of great details about how the submarine works, how the crew worked to navigate it, etc. I found that interesting.\n",

      "The history between Andan and Josephine held the potential for of tension and conflict. With them being former lovers, I’d expected a few sparks to fly–and they do, but I wonder if it was enough. There were a few power struggles here and there, but…I guess I was expecting more. (Though, maybe that's actually a good thing. *shrugs*)\n",
      "\n",
      "There was also a certain reveal that popped up with one of the characters, which I was a little confuddled on. It seems recently there’s been a huge surge with authors wanting to include more characters who are gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered in their stories. I’ve got nothing against this, but when it is done I feel like it needs to be well-integrated. If it’s sprung on you at the last minute then is never mentioned again, then why use it in the first place? Mere shock factor doesn’t cut it for me. If it’s supposed to shock, then shouldn't it also continue to add more tension throughout the rest of the story (at least until it's resolved)?\n",
      "\n",
      "I won’t spoil who’s who and what, but I will say the reveal of character which occurred in this light didn’t hold any real significance for me. I wasn’t shocked (that seemed to be the intent) so much as left scratching my head, wondering why it mattered in the scope of the larger story. (And if it shouldn't matter, then why make such a big deal about it?)\n",

      "For Cherie Priest, steampunk is all about having fun, and I believe she delivers plenty of this with . It may not be my story in the series, but I did enjoy reading it. I liked spending time with the characters and thought they were all full of personality and pluck. Sometimes, though, I wish she would take things a little further–-like with Marie Laveau–-but in some cases it could be she’s just saving some action for future novels. In any case, I think I’ll stick around for the next to find out how it all ends. ;)\n",

If there’s one book I would recommend reading before , though, it would be --just because it gives you a clear picture of where all of the events in the following books are stemming from. Besides the war, there’s one other major event that’s affecting the overarching plot.\n",

      "It all started in Seattle…\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The gist of the story is that there's a submarine that the confederate supporters need to get out of New Orleans - this is an alternate universe story. Josephine, owner of a bordello, recruits an old flame to pilot it out. There's Texans, Voodoo Queens, Zombies and Pirates.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all that going on, why did I get so bored? It wasn't the writing, Ms. Priest is descriptive and her writing flows easily. It was mostly the characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn't bring myself to care about Josephine. I wanted to, she's a strong single woman running a bordello in New Orleans, dealing with all the mean Texans and helping the Confederates - what's not to like? But Josephine just came across as a cold fish. If Josephine and her old flame, Andan Cly, had such a big love affair, why isn't there more tension between them? I mean, we actually hear more about their relationship through Cly's thoughts than through Josephine.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's also very little conflict between the characters - the mainly African-American rebels didn't bat an eye when Josephine brought a mainly White group into their hideout. Seriously? Then, when one character turns out to be transsexual, it is presented in a awkward way and then just put aside as if to say 'Oh. I see. Well, carry on.' I was confused as to why the character had to be outed at all. I mean, did GANYMEDE need some LGBT-ness? What was up with that? It made no sense to the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Voodoo Queen seemed as if she were simply a delivery tool. There was no way to get from A to B, so she was tucked in to be a bridge.\n",

      "Overall, the storyline was good, the writing is fabulous, but the characters left much to be desired.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I think Cherie Priest has some great ideas but needs a little help with execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the speculative aspect (20 years into the Civil War, Texas is still its own republic, Seattle is a blighted waste). I like the way she writes action scenes: her zombie battles are fun and when her characters are actually in the middle of a fight, it's exciting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest flaw I find in Priest's writing is her tendency to over-explain everything. There's a lot of telling about what happened instead of showing, there's a lot of setting up just how spunky and independent her female characters are, and god I GET it: Andan Cly is tall! A smart reader doesn't have to be reminded of how tall he is every frickin' time he has to duck his head or someone has to crane to look up at him. The first 12 references to his height were plenty, I assure you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her pacing, something I've semi-complained about since , still needs a little work. It often feels like she runs out of things for her characters to do so she just ends the story at whatever point that she got bored. This particular story is set in New Orleans, which has a growing zombie problem, and the focus was on the submarine, of all things! How can we be in New Orleans with zombies, and barely get any zombies?\n",
      "\n",
      "Priest also likes to throw in random details without any followup (as in a \"shocking\" revelation about one character at a point in the book where it doesn't matter at all and is actually just stupid and distracting).\n",

I honestly don't understand why people who do not like these types of stories continue to read every new series that comes out and then gives it bad ratings and talks a lot of crap about it when obviously it's not your thing! I say that because I am sure that this will happen with this book as well. Also, if you're one of those people who believe that there is only room for one dominant billionaire man on the planet then you won't want to read this book either. You'll spend the entire time comparing Blake to your precious Christian, Gideon, or Jesse...\n",

I really enjoy the banter between Blake & Erica in these books. I also enjoyed the sexual growth and progression that was in this one. That one scene involving a spanking was tectonic plates shifting kind of orgasmic inducing. I'm also happy that while we are left with some questions to ponder and having to patiently or not-so-patiently await the next book we got a great deal of answers in this book. It ran the gambit in emotion inducing, from wanting to cry, to wanting to scream, and all kinds of gush worthy \"awe\" and \"holy hotness\" in between. So yeah, once again, I cannot wait for the next book!!!!\n",

      "Me está gustando mucho el cuerpo que está tomando la saga, si sigue así podría ser muy buena. Lo mejor que le puede ocurrir a una saga es que cada libro vaya siendo mejor que el anterior. El único problema que le veo a una segunda parte tan buena es que las dos siguientes no la superen y que decepcione al lector.\n",
      "Pero de momento me está gustando mucho, se disfruta muchísimo y se lee muy rápido porque tiene una trama muy ligerita\n",

      "I haven't been this angry about a sequel since . WTF happened to my smart, independent, techie-genius Erica? In the last book, she was fierce and focused, someone I could admire. I rooted for her as she bravely started her own company, went toe-to-toe with her control-freak boyfriend, and overcame a stunningly shitty introduction to the world of sex. In this book, she was replaced by some TSTL damsel in distress. She waffled, she cried, she ran and hid from everyone who might have helped her get out of her situation. But did she hide from the bad guys? No. Did she outwit them with some clever scheme? No. Did she enlist the aid of law enforcement, private security, or her billionaire, badass boyfriend with his bevy of blackmail material? Fuck no, that would, apparently, make her dependent. This woman has a Harvard education FFS, and yet she thinks going off to meet with the Bad Guy and his evil henchman at an abandoned gravel pit with no backup, no surveillance, and no one who knows where she's going is the best way to solve her problems? After the guy has repeatedly hit her, threatened her life, and made her an accessory after the fact? What did she major in at Harvard, ?!\n",

      "This is a book about puberty aimed at the younger (8-12) set and has as a major selling point the fact that it covers puberty without going into detail about reproduction (although, I should state that the authors *strongly* prefer that parents DO address reproduction when they talk with their daughters about puberty.) Since puberty is striking girls younger and younger, it's nice to know a book like this is out there, which is definitely still centered on being a kid and tween and not bogged down by teenager details.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to admit that, when I first read about this book, I was like, \"How can you responsibly cover puberty while ignoring reproduction?\" But in this book covers puberty in the right mount of detail and authenticity, mentioning that reproduction is a part of it, but focusing on what a girl will actually *experience* as she goes through this phase. The writing style is conversational, compassionate, and funny at times. This is a book I'd happily recommend to any parent looking for a warm, credible, safe, and responsible approach to puberty for young girls.\n",

      "This is the perfect book to share with your 7-11 year old girl. It covers everything about puberty and nothing about sex. It also doesn't go into how to fix your hair or keep your nails looking nice -- no appearances based information, but lots of great, medically based, facts and tips for managing pubertal changes - including body changes, friend changes, and mood changes! The authors (both doctors) write with a voice that is so positive, encouraging, and just on the right level for 3rd -5th graders. I love that this book doesn't go into reproduction, but lets girls understand and process all the changes that will happen with puberty without dealing with the more awkward discussion of sex.\n",
      "I bought this book to read WITH my 10 year old, thinking I would have to force her to read it with me. To my surprise, she loved it and we have actually read it together THREE times! She loves the stories that introduce each chapter because they are so relatable for her. Then the \"informational\" parts of each chapter provide no-nonsence, factual information with warmth and some humor.\n",
      "This book has made my daughter actually look forward to puberty, and it's given us some great things to talk about as we head in that direction!\n",

You work your fingers to the bone, set everything up just so, design and plan and make sure that everyone is as safe as can possibly be expected given the fact that the people you work with are security experts with darn dangerous jobs, complete with guns and knives and things that go boom. Oh, it isn’t bad enough that your boss, a domineering jerk with a superiority complex and an ego so overinflated he had to buy a whole other building to store it in, won’t let you go out on field work, because apparently since your reproductive organs are on the inside and not the outside, you aren’t good enough – even though your father spent every hour or your life from the time you were big enough to haul a rucksack and pull a trigger teaching you to be good at field work (although, once you got old enough to actually DO said field work, see above…) NOW the unmitigated JERK changes the whole game on you DURING an op – and leaves you sitting there with your thumbs up your bum and feces on your face while he waltzes in and does what he likes.

      "After three and a half years of working to keep Jake Ryder’s teams safe in the field, of being patient and banging her head against the wall, all the pent up frustration of being shoved to the back of the room, disrespected, ignored, and refraining from pointing out Jake’s idiocy, biting her tongue to keep the peace, well. Anything can happen in a split second in the field – lives depended on being able to be fast on her feet as the Ops Manager, on being on site to handle any of a million complications that can cost lives – but Ryder’s determined that “her place was anywhere besides in the field”. Gender bias, anyone? But this is the very last straw on a very large pile of straw that caused the whole thing to fall down. Marley is out of there – maybe he expected her to do what he wanted, when he wanted, no questions asked. And yeah, maybe she had put up with it for long enough that she had nobody to blame but herself. But this sort of disrespect? Holding her back. Treating her like she is expendable, a mindless tool, after all she has done to keep them safe? Just down right not trusting her? This is finally IT.\n",

      "And just as she is walking out the door, who should ring her up but her ex-boyfriend. Her dead ex-boyfriend. Well, everyone thought he was dead, killed on an op gone bad in South America. What perfect timing. In a cold fury, Marley borrows Jake’s jet and pilot and soon finds herself in the jungles of Columbia on a rescue mission. Gray McKnight was alive – and her own father had lied to her about his death – had left Gray behind.\n",

      "How much more betrayal can a woman take?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s call a spade a spade. Jake Ryder is one of the more obnoxious jerks in the annals of obnoxious jerkhood. Spoiled rotten, self-centered and totally clueless. He works Marley like a slave, gives her no respect, no positive input, basically blows her off and just expects her to be there, like a good little lap dog, when he needs her. And then, when she finally is “done with this” . . . He is shocked?!?!? Where is his good little lap dog, fetching his slippers and pipe and waiting for him to kick her across the room when she is done??\n",
      "\n",
      "Garg. I wanted to punch them both in the face – Jake for being Jake, and Marley for putting up with it! Because, you know, she isn’t really done, she plans to come back to heel as soon as her rescue is done. It’s not like she couldn’t find a better position, with a boatload more respect, somewhere away from Jake and her dad, someplace where she is appreciated for her excellence at what she does. Nah, she is sure she will come back and, yep, things won’t change, she is just taking a little vacation. In Columbia. In the Jungle. Amongst the drug runners and cartel members and armed psychos. Have I mentioned the armed psychos? Oh, and let’s not forget Grey. There is something odd there – but that is to be seen, because Marley can’t leave him down there, not like her father did.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, here comes SuperJake. (Insert 1970’s Superman theme music here.) Convinced Marley is just “playing a little game” (how demeaning is That, I ask you?) he blows into Puerto Asis, Columbia, all filled with sanctimony and enough pomposity I wanted to kick his ya-ya’s up between his eyeballs . . . And oh, Doy, “One thing registered. That she was still mad. But he couldn’t tell if it was because he’d changed that op, or if there was more going on.” Ya THINK?? Sigh. And, OMG!! When he finally find her in Pureto Asis – GASP – she is With. A. Man!! Well, he certainly didn’t want her for a girlfriend – “He’d sure as hell never pick Marley”.\n",

      "So, why’s he got his panties in a twist?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, unable to keep his nose out of things that are definitely NOT his business, Old Jakey has to get all up in her business, and she has to drag his incompetent backside through the jungle on her quest to rescue McKnight. And he really is the most incompetent supposed Special Forces dude I have ever come across in a long history of loving suspense and thrillers. Marley actually has to elbow him in his side to get him to shut up when they are within feet of paramilitary soldiers armed with automatic weapons who are determined to track them down and kill them. Really? His lack of jungle skills, fear of creepy crawlies and general incompetence had me rolling my eyes nearly out of my head.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shame is, the story could have been a lot better. The concept was good, even though there were many times when I found myself screaming at the characters. “Even after everything they’d already been through on this trip, he still thought she couldn’t hold her own.” She showed him up, time and again, in jungle survival, in pulling his ignorant backside out of the fire more times than I cared to count, and he still disses her. The thing is, it really is her own fault. . . . would she forever be stuck in this role-standing on the fringes, waiting for someone to view her as capable, waiting for him to see the real her?” Well, sister, you let everyone push you around long enough without standing up for yourself, why should you be so surprised when they just keep doing it? Jake spends all his time calling other people dumb, idiots, etc… but his actions pretty much proved that posts have a bit more savvy than he does, and yet she still allows herself to be treated badly.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were many other things that irritated me about the book, most especially the idiocy that occurred after they return to the States. There is the completely obnoxious, “I don’t want her, but you can’t have her, and by the way, I am going to boink her against a wall during your engagement party – you know, the one where you are celebrating your engagement to her - and she is going to let me” thing going on that drove me to drink.\n",

      "Marley has been the glue that keeps the Aegis group together for the last three and half years but with Jake still not letting her go out into the field and changing up missions without including her, she is done feeling under appreciated. When an ex-boyfriend from the past is resurrected, Marley decides that now is the time to prove to Jake and her father that she has what it takes to get the job done. Jake is not familiar with this lost feeling and anxiousness that has dominated his feelings ever since Marley took a little vacation. When he finds out she went to Columbia, he just knows he has to get there. At his arrival, finding Marley with another man, witnessing her capabilities, and not able to keep his usual professional distance, has his Pandora's Box of feelings cracking wide open. Their jungle adventure is about to become more dangerous than they ever imagined.\n",
      " \n",
      "After getting a hint of Jake and Marley's boiling pot relationship in the last book, , I was highly anticipating their story and I was not disappointed. Marley had somewhat of an unconventional childhood with following her father all around the world as he built up his security company. She grew up with the knowledge of how to run operations and is good at her job but while her father let her travel with the team, he never let her go directly into the field. Wanting to branch out and grow, Marley quits and joins Aegis, Jake Ryder's new and upcoming security company. Unfortunately, Jake turns out to be even more of a brick wall and even after three and half years of proving herself, refuses to not only let her go out into the field but doesn't even let her travel with the team. Their story starts here when Marley finally pushes back at the domineering men in her life and Jake gets a taste of his own medicine when Marley leaves.\n",
      " \n",
      "I found Marley and Jake to be (mostly) believable, likeable, and frustrating. Marley may have taken Jake's dominating attitude for too long but he was still her boss and she was building a reputation at a new company. Jake may have come off as an alpha-hole one too many times but he is a former Navy SEAL, head of a growing company, and man with years of training to take charge of situations, be a leader, and get things done. Jake respects Marley but as his buried feelings for her start to come to the surface, he also fears for her safety, in the way that people who have seen far too much do. Marley was a mixture of capability and a touch of naivety; she has the skills for the field but not the emotional experience. I thought the author did a great job of showing how all these factors swirled together to show why our couple is attracted to one another and how the tension between them is created.\n",
      " \n",
      "The snarky dialogue between these two was fun and helped to create what I like to call a thunderstorm couple. When Jake arrived in Columbia, we could hear the rumblings of an approaching storm, then as they trek through the jungle and he sees how capable Marley is and he begins to become aware and address why he can't relax or settle down unless he is around Marley, the storm hits. Lightning cracks the sky when they meet a group of indigenous people and drinking their jungle juice had them having one heck of a night. The eye of the storm comes when Jake does his patent push away move and they rescue Marley's ex-boyfriend. Then things really come to ahead as lightning crashing, thunder booming, and swirling winds catch Jake and Marley up as anger, jealousy, hurt, impromptu and poorly timed sex against a wall, and love make up the storm's tail end.\n",
      " \n",
      "I focused a lot on Marley and Jake's relationship for this review and that is because it is the main part of the story and worked the best. The story arc of Marley's ex-boyfriend needing rescuing works to start off our adventure and keep our leads together but was fairly weak with an obvious villain and the how and why of the ex being mad at Marley's father and all the manipulated story that came as a result of this; it was a bit of a stretch.\n",
      " \n",
      "If you like some adventure in your books and a fair amount of hot and heavy scenes, you'll want to pick this one up. Marley may have started off naïve but after getting a taste of the field, she intellectually realizes it may actually not be for her and while Jake's capabilities may keep him headstrong, we do get to see him respect Marley's more and bend a little on letting her be in charge; great growth by characters. The leaders of the Aegis group didn't disappoint and I'm looking forward to future characters getting their story, particularly Marley's lone wolf brother.\n",

      "Fatal Pursuit by Elisabeth Naughton is a 2015 Montlake publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have enjoyed the last two books in this series and was eagerly anticipating Jake and Marley's story. However, I was a little frustrated by the story line in this one and struggled to get into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marley has worked for Jake, a former SEAL and current CEO of Aegis, dutifully for over three years. But, her boss continues to hold her back, refusing to allow her to do field work, and it's slowly killing her inside. When Jake pulls a stunt that proves his arrogance and lack of appreciation of her, she throws in the towel. Right on the heels of that monumental decision, she gets a phone call from an old boyfriend, a man she believed was dead, begging her to help him. So, with no job, and nothing to lose, Marley travels to South America to rescue the man she once considered marrying.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Jake discovers Marley is gone, he enlist Eve to help locate her, then takes off after her, thus beginning a fatal pursuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The previous installments of this series had a stylish quality to them this one lacked. The suspense wasn't nearly as tense and the action was muted. In fact, the mystery was flat and predictable, as it was pretty much spelled out for us that something was awfully fishy about this whole set up.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was frustrating was Marley's gullibility which is something a person so well suited to field work could ill afford. I expected more from her than just an ability to survive in the jungle. She needed to work that brain of hers on all cylinders, and stop making impressing Jake the more important goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The foray the couple takes into a native village was a detour that took the story way off course, and while I am certainly not an expert on native tribes, or their rituals and ceremonies, this part of the story seemed highly implausible and a ridiculous way of getting Jake and Marley to loosen up around each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the story gets back to the original thread regarding the search for Marley's friend. Once the man is located the story really flounders. Jake and Marley only had a marginal amount of chemistry between them and Jake was not at all likable. He took liberties by looking into Marley's medical records, and various other invasions of her privacy, is sexist, controlling, and unapologetic about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have also recently discovered that I can't stand the trope involving the female protagonist finally moving out from behind her controlling father's shadow, only to find herself falling in love with a man with those very same traits. But, at least Marley doesn't sacrifice her convictions to rationalize a relationship with Jake, accepting and putting up with his treatment of her, and folding to his will. No, Jake will have to redeem himself and it looks like he's going to drop the ball. Until.....\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I must grudgingly admit Jake really pulls off a 180, goes down grand gesture avenue, and I almost forgot about his prior behavior, as a result. He really did tone down his bossiness, although it still peaks through here and there at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, while this was not the best book in the series, the conclusion offset some of the complaints I had with the story, but not enough to push the rating up to a higher level. This one gets 3 stars\n",

      "\n",
      "Marley left her father's security firm because he treated her like a girl. She went to work for Jake at Aegis Security thinking that he would use all her talents. Instead, Jake treats her like his Girl Friday and after one particular op, Marley has had it. Her last words to him \"I'm done with this...\" echo in his mind as he discovers she has taken off for South America and God only knows what trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marley received a call from a man she dated and thought had been dead for 5 years. He desperately needs her help to get out of Columbia and he needs her now. Marley takes off and Jake, being a good boss, follows. Nothing romantic, he just needs to make sure she is okay. He gains a whole new appreciation for her talents as they get stranded in the jungle and is stunned that he never even had a clue how resourceful she is or how hot.\n",

      "When Marley and Jake are guests of a village of natives the men want to mate Marley and kill Jake. Marley saves him and they are \"mated\" by the village. A wild, passionate night follows after which Jake does his withdrawal thing and Marley slowly realizes that Jake may never be able to express his true feelings. They find and rescue Gray and return to civilization and things between Jake and Marley go from bad to worse, with Gray ready to step right in. Jake hasn't like Gray from the moment he met him and now that he is putting the moves on Marley he downright hates the guy. something is off about him.\n",

      "This was hands down one of the best books I've read in a year. I thought it was going to be your basic male-teen angst story--motorcycles, quarterbacks, etc.--but boy, was I was wrong. It was so much more. The characters are complex and offbeat, yet as recognizable as your own family and friends. The whole cast is great, but some of my favorite characters are four-legged, including a deliriously sex-charged poodle named El Guapo and a trio of brood mares who look after the narrator, Arlo, who's lost his real mother to violence.\n",

      "I began making notes for DIRT BIKES, DRONES in 2009 after hearing P.W. Singer interviewed on NPR's Fresh Air. During the interview, Singer--a specialist on 21st Century warfare--told the story of a teenage boy with crazy-mad video game skills—skills that could translate to flying real drones in real war zones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Singer’s words helped to crystallize my thinking around several themes. One was the idea that violence against the individual is, in fact, violence against society as a whole. As Arlo Santiago (the book's 17-year-old narrator) reflects, “A perfect hit goes beyond a single target. It goes wide. And it goes deep.”\n",

      "Another theme (shared in my previous novel, ADIOS, NIRVANA) focused on the importance of friendship and family in dealing with grief.\n",

      "A fourth was the inclination of technology to outpace human wisdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "And finally, the idea that people possess—inherently, if they open themselves to it—a universal awareness and knowledge that connects them with their fullest potential and place in the universe. Arlo calls this state of awareness “The Drone Zone.”\n",

With this being said I thought this book was great, it remedied me of the novel Bless Me, Ultima, but only because of the honest New Mexico feel.

      "This will be a great addition to our 9th grade book clubs. It appeals to readers into dirtbikes and video games especially, and I can’t say I’ve ready many good YA books that do. It also touches on many important issues that our students grapple with, such as military involvement, family and money problems, coping with loss, and more.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I'm calling this a guy-book, and I think that's pretty accurate. It will also appeal to girls that are attracted to motorcycles and video games, or at least attracted to guys that are into motorcycles and video games.\n",
      "I enjoyed it. Can't say I loved it, but it's not a bad book. I will say that I wanted to keep reading, but for me that's setting the bar pretty low. There's quite a bit of \"who are you and what are your values and if those are your values should you really be doing this?\" preaching, but it's not too in your face.\n",
      "The special attention and perks Arlo (our hero) gets from the military are a little far-fetched, but of course this book is aimed at teens, and they are likely to be a tad more credulous than I am. I certainly hope so. It would be tragic to have my level of cynicism at such a young age.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "JACOB and Wilhelm Grimm did not set out to entertain children, not at first. They were primarily collectors and philologists, who almost two centuries ago assembled German fairy tales as part of a life's work that included, Maria Tatar points out, ''massive volumes with such titles as 'German Legends,' 'German Grammar,' 'Ancient German Law' and 'German Heroic Legends.' '' (''Jacob Grimm's 'German Grammar' alone,'' we are told helpfully, ''took up 3,854 pages.'') They published their first collection of Märchen, ''Children's Stories and Household Tales,'' in 1812, with a second volume in 1815 and an expanded and revised edition in 1819; folklorists who became, of necessity, storytellers, they reworked the tales for years, smoothing them while removing material they considered unsuitable for children.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Grimms' fairy tales are inescapably, well, grimmer than the courtly, sparkling 17th-century ''Cinderella'' and ''Tales of Mother Goose'' of Charles Perrault. The Brothers Grimm toned down bawdier content -- in their first edition, Rapunzel's question to the enchantress was why, after the Prince's visits, her belly had begun to swell -- but not much of the violence and bloodshed. Occasionally they were even heightened. ''The Juniper Tree'' is a treatment of death and rebirth, just deserts and restoration, that feels almost sacred, but the child murder and cannibalism make it untellable today as children's fiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'' gives us a sample of the 210 tales in the authoritative version of the seventh and final edition of 1857. Tatar, dean of humanities and professor of Germanic languages and literature at Harvard University, has newly translated 37 of the 210, as well as nine tales for adults, and annotated them, drawing on the commentary of the Grimms themselves and of writers who have reused the Grimms' material, from Jane Yolen and Peter Straub to Terry Pratchett.\n",
      "\n",
      "Annotating fairy tales must be different in kind from the task of annotating, say, a Sherlock Holmes story or Lewis Carroll's ''Hunting of the Snark.'' Sherlock Holmes stories don't have a multiplicity of variants from different cultures and times; Red Riding Hood exists in versions in which, before she clambers into bed with the wolf, she first eats her grandmother's flesh and drinks her blood; in which she strips for the wolf; in which, naked, she excuses herself to use the privy and escapes; in which she is first devoured, then cut from the wolf's stomach by a huntsman; in which. . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "Tatar's book, with its annotations, explanations, front matter and end matter, illustrations and biographical essay and further-reading section, is difficult to overpraise. A volume for parents, for scholars, for readers, it never overloads the stories or, worse, reduces them to curiosities. And as an object, it's a chocolate-box feast of multicolored inks and design.\n",
      "\n",
      "The annotations are fascinating. Tatar points out things so plain that commentators sometimes miss them (for example, that ''Hansel and Gretel'' is a tale driven by food and hunger from a time when, for the peasantry, eating until you were full was a pipe dream). In the introduction to ''Snow White,'' we learn that ''the Grimms, in an effort to preserve the sanctity of motherhood, were forever turning biological mothers into stepmothers,'' while an annotation tells us that in the 1810 manuscript version ''there is only one queen, and she is both biological mother and persecutor.''\n",
      "\n",
      "Only rarely does Tatar note the blindingly obvious. When the heroine of ''The Singing Soaring Lark'' (the Grimms' '''') sits down and cries, we're told that characters often cry when things are going badly: ''The weeping is emblematic of the grief and sadness they feel, and it gives the character an opportunity to pause before moving on to a new phase of action.'' Well, quite.\n",
      "\n",
      "The assemblage of stories -- Germanic tales that have become part of world culture -- parades an array of nameless youngest sons and intelligent and noble girls. As both A. S. Byatt (who wrote the introduction) and Tatar point out, the heroes and heroines triumph not because they have good hearts or are purer or nobler than others (indeed, most of the young men are foolish, and some are downright lazy) but because they are the central characters, and the story will take care of them, as stories do.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ''adult'' section contains several murderous cautionary tales, along with the nightmare of ''The Jew in the Brambles,'' a story not much reprinted since 1945, in which the hero tortures a Jewish peddler using a magic fiddle, making him dance in brambles; at the end the peddler is hanged. Three of the Grimms' tales contain Jewish figures; ''the two that feature anti-Semitism in its most virulent form were included in the Compact Edition designed for young readers'' (1825), Tatar tells us. ''The Jew in the Brambles'' casts back through the book, leaving one wondering whether the ashes Cinderella slept in would one day become the ashes of Auschwitz.\n",
      "\n",
      "AND yet most of the stories, no matter how murderous, exude comfort. Rereading them feels like coming home. Tatar's translation is comfortable and familiar (the occasional verse translations are slightly less felicitous); several times I found myself reading right through an unfamiliar or forgotten tale to find out what happened next, ignoring the annotations completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Illustrations are an important ingredient of fairy tales. The variety and choice here are beyond reproach: among them, Arthur Rackham, with his polled trees that gesture and bend like old men and his adults all gnarled and twisted like trees; the elegance of Kay Nielsen; the lush draperies and delicate fancies of Warwick Goble.\n",
      "\n",
      "''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'' treats the stories as something important -- not, in the end, because of what they tell us of the buried roots of Germanic myth, or because of the often contradictory and intermittently fashionable psychoanalytic interpretations, or for any other reason than that they are part of the way we see the world, because they should be told. That's what I took from it, anyway. But fairy tales are magic mirrors: they show you what you wish to see.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I own a copy of this book and boy is it expensive. I think it is the most pricey book I've ever bought so far. But I'm telling you it is worth it. You will like this book. Especially if you are into fairy tales just like me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so remember when you were a kid, remember all those fairy tale stuffs you've been told about? Tell you something-they aren't the real story. The Fairy tale books printed for kids and the Fairy tale movies filmed by Disney were all edited to fit the imagination of younger generations.\n",

      "\n",
      "This is the unedited and translated version of the original tales published by the Brothers Grimm themselves.\n",

      "There's annotations and pictures that will help you further understand the real tale and the history behind it.\n",

      "So if you think you're old enough for real gruesome tales, you might wanna read this.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I should make it clear at the outset that I like the stories themselves. My problem is with the annotations. The annotations dealing with the social realities of the culture and the many variants of the more well-known stories are interesting, but disappointingly rare. Rather, most of the notes range from useless and unperceptive to just plain annoying. For example, part of a note on \"Hansel and Gretel\" helpfully informs us that:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The 'perfect happiness' of the ending is brought about in part by the acquisition of material wealth, which guarantees that the father and children will live happily ever after.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, what makes Ms. Tatar think I couldn't have made that connection for myself?\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, there are the constant (and usually far-fetched) claims that the stories mirror Greek mythology. If Ms. Tatar had chosen to allude instead to the mythology of Germanic peoples, I would have found it much more plausible. However, it is very difficult for me to see a story passed down by generations of illiterate Germans as \"a ghoulish nursery counterpart of the Greek myth of Cronus...\" (\"The Juniper Tree\"). Likewise I find it difficult to see the point of this annotation to \"The Golden Bird\":\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Like Odysseus, the king's son returns home in disguise. The princess, like the nurse in The Odyssey, recognizes him, even in his beggar's clothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While, in this case, the similarity is indisputable, I fail to see any evidence that it is intentional or meaningful. Add to this the editor's insistence on matters such as \"the phallic nature of the frog\" in \"The Frog King,\" and it starts looking like she is grasping at straws. The end result is that most of the notes come off looking like faux-intellectual nonsense.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is a beautiful edition, but very awkward to hold.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have always loved fairy tales and this edition is wonderful because of the insight the editors give us into the fairy tales. Their origins. The meaning and symbolism. They can be a little gruesome, but fun in their own way. Also, the illustrations included in this edition are delightful.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "What to say about the Brothers Grimm? They were there, they were kind of awesome. In fact, one of the surprises about this volume for me was the biographical portion. It was interesting to learn that Jacob and Wilhelm considered themselves scholars foremost, and their passion for folklore was part of their passion for German culture (particularly pre-Industrial culture), language (they died in the \"F\"s for their German dictionary, which isn't surprising when you consider the Germans have a word for every circumstance ever encountered and some that haven't...), democracy (losing their professor jobs when they protested the forced dissolution of Parliament), and all other things that belonged to what they called \"poetry\"— the ways we can tap into the human consciousness. In fact, the most illuminating notes in the come not from Maria Tatar, but from the brothers themselves, in the form of their prefaces for the various editions of . I won't summarize it because it's the sort of thing you have to read yourself, but it does make the introductions by Tatar or A.S. Byatt seem a little superfluous.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, I continue to be a little confused who these oversized Annotated Norton editions are intended for. They're not detailed enough for scholarly use (where, for example, are the Grimms' own annotations, or information on when each story was originally published?) and much too unwieldy for the casual reader. I really would've appreciated systematic notes on sources the Grimms used & revisions they made across editions for each featured tale, as well as information on other major variations (or at least its Aarne-Thompson classification!). That being said, Maria Tatar does choose an interesting selection of well-known, provoking, and obscure-ish stories that give a nice feel for the complete work. Her footnotes are a little less informative and a little more explanatory than I prefer, but viable. Her strengths lie more in the brief introductions she gives each tale, where she is more free-wheeling and distinctive in her commentary. Rating: 4 stars\n",
      "\n",
      "Some thoughts:\n",
      "- On bowdlerized tales: The Grimms sadly de-sexified and made it less interesting (see also: , which at least the Grimms imbue with a pleasant whimsy that \"Rapunzel\" lacks). The key to this story is that worldly knowledge coming to the girl in the tower is not only inevitable, but also joyful as much as it is painful, as rebellious to her \"bad mother\" as dutiful it is to her \"good mother\". In short, I really need to get my hands on Charlotte-Rose de la Force's 1698 , and one of those bawdy French versions that Tatar mentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- On the Grimms as folklorists: , , and are all variations on the \"pure-hearted sister saves a gaggle of brothers from avian curse.\" It's a nice choice by Tatar to include all three as a demonstration of the nature of fairy tales and their ability to morph through the oral (and literary) tradition. \"Six Swans\" (popularized by Han Christian Andersen as \"The Wild Swans\") is probably rightfully the most well-known, but I also find the very similar \"The Twelve Brothers\" very interesting for the rare antagonistic father/helpful mother parental unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "- On tales I like better: Both & are variants on the \"girl marries black widower\" story (a type of which \"Bluebeard\" is the most known), with the important distinction that they both have happy endings. The murderous husband is defeated with the help of an old servant woman (solidarity!) in the \"The Robber Bridegroom\", but the heroine of \"Fitcher's Bird\" saves both her sisters and herself with some cleverness, magic and crafting skillz (she doesn't turn into a bird, she just cosplays as one).\n",
      "\n",
      "- On tales I like worse: is one of the tales I find plain eclipsed* by a variation, i.e. Afanasyev's \"Tsarevich Ivan, the Fire Bird & the Gray Wolf\" has more consistent humor and lacks the more unwieldy elements. However, \"The Golden Bird\" provide a backstory for the endlessly patient fox who does everything for our hapless hero though, which goes wholly unexplained in Afanasyev's version.\n",
      "*Also, I know I'm laying it down WAY in the middle of this review, but truth: \"The Witch\" (Lang) > ; \"Donkeyskin\" (Perrault) > ; \"Tom-Tit-Tot\" >\n",
      "\n",
      "- On adult tales: Tatar also includes a section of oddball stories, most of which are short gruesome bits the Grimm's excised when they revised subsequent editions of for bedtime reading (though they kept in the cringingly anti-Semetic \"The Jew in the Brambles\"). is a particularly chilling, superstitious vignette— in fact a lot of these wouldn't be out of place as modern urban myths or ghost stories, which goes to show how broad a net the Grimms were casting on German folklore.\n",
      "\n",
      "- On best tales:\n",
      "1. - There's something so destabilizing about this story. It's all playful suggestiveness, when the glib happily-ever-after between the haughty princess and the horny prince is interrupted by the appearance of the titular character. In clatter of iron bands breaking, we veer into the ecstatic (the painful freedom of the heart!), the pathetic (the ignorance of the lovers). Why did we think we knew between sexual love and spiritual love anyway?\n",
      "\n",
      "2. - I thought I knew this story, but there's something to the specificity of the Grimm telling which makes the story more interesting than the simple parable it appears. Particularly Tatar notes the gender subversion that goes on with the ambition of the wife to become king, emperor, pope and then even god. It seems to signify a fundamental dissatisfaction with the marital state, or gendered institutions that is left unresolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. - I was so fascinated with the story as a child, with the perversity of getting something from nothing (except an inflated sense of self-importance). As Tatar notes, the Grimms' German tricksters differ from those from other traditions by being marked not by extreme cleverness but foolishness. Thus a man with no plan ends up on top of a story with no magic. Go figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. - Can the most famous fairy tale from the best-known folk storytellers be underrated? Everyone has a favorite version of the world's most popular fairy tale; \"Tam and Cam\" is mine, because —— reasons, but \"Aschenputtle\" doesn't get enough recognition for having the perfect mix of moral and morbid. The heroine doesn't only get her just rewards from domestic obedience, but by a pagan alliance with the birds and the otherworldly protection of her tree mother. It also highlights the wonderful unadorned quality which characterizes the Grimms's storytelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. - I had never heard this one, and I have no idea why except perhaps that the Grimms didn't really have anything to do with it. Penned by Philipp Otto Runge especially for the Grimms's collection, it's an intense tale, with a distinctive unhinged, mythic quality to it. I mean this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Y'all have to be in on this.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. - Iconic. Tatar observes that the queen is the \"center of narrative energy\" of the story, and the dwarfs her chief obstacles. Strangely, this works. No one should be fooled by the Grimms's revision of stepmother for mother, this is the female version of the Oedipal myth, swirling with parental resentment and chockfull of the sinister symbols of feminine beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. - I haven't read Caroline Stahl's original \"The Ungrateful Dwarf\", but the Grimm version has such a vivid literary quality that makes its rare depiction of domestic bliss (in an all-female household, no less) all that much more striking. Particularly the interaction of personalities —the dwarf's irascible greed, the bear's nobility, the mother's loving firmness, Snow White's shyness, and Rose Red's fearlessness— is the chief driving force of a story that would otherwise be lacking in conflict. It's patently unrighteous that this fairy tale is less well-known.\n",

      "I am incredibly sorry to say that after months of trying to get into this book I finally decided to mark it as a DNF. I have no idea what's happening between me and this book but I couldn't make it through the first half at all. I pushed myself but it's just not woking. The writing and the story seem quite interesting but unfortunately this is probably about me and not about the book. This is the first and, I hope, the only time I couldn't review a book for NetGalley and I apologize for this.\n",

      "Henry Jekyll’s aim was to create a drug in order to free the human’s from selfishness and vice, instead he created a pill that turned people into monsters without warning, monster’s that target the human’s heart and caused London to fall under a quarantine when the drug hit the streets and infected half its population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Characters\n",
      "I actually found the characters in this story quiet good. I thought the development was well done. Did I wish for more? Yes, maybe a little more, but overall I wasn’t really disappointed. Each filled with secrets, but nothing that shocked me once they were finally revealed.\n",

      "SUMMARY\n",
      "\n",
      "London has been in quarantine for 13 years thanks to the Hydes, monstrous-like heart-eating beings that shift from ordinary infected humans who have taken the Hyde drug. Elliot, the son of the physician looking for a cure, who in the search for a weapon against the Hydes accidentally made himself an empath, and Iris, a strange American girl who has no fear, aim to discover the secret of the Hyde drug and uncover the conspiracy around it that could lead all the way to the top through Elliot’s best friend Cambrien – the son of the Lord Mayor of London, who will do anything to stay in power.\n",
      "\n",
      "PLOT\n",
      "\n",
      "Elliot and his eventual Scooby Gang try to discover the awful secrets hidden in this alternate London while still living their lives – enjoying contraband, going to music halls, official dinners to please the Lord Mayor, a brutish and terrifying figure. Now that I take a step back and think about it, it’s not a plot-driven novel. It’s very character driven, and very emotional. Elliot is grieving over the death of his mother, his changed relationship with his father, his new power that he doesn’t want and can’t control, and the guilt of being responsible for a friend’s death.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHARACTERS\n",
      "\n",
      "I mentioned there’s a Scooby Gang! I don’t know what else to call it. There’s this ‘team’ that forms of teen friendships, led by Cambrien, the Lord Mayor’s son. His best friend Elliot is involved, Iris is brought in, and they are joined by Philomena, a fiery debutante-to-be, and Andrew, the brother of the boy Elliot feels guilty over. I love this gang. I love them hanging out, enjoying the contraband, I love their love for each other, I love their secrets and different relationships to each other. It’s so cool to see an actual gang of friends in an alternate-history-paranormal book. Another character to be aware of is the scarily efficient Lord Mayor of London, who is an awful person and an even worse father to Cambrien. I would be genuinely afraid to meet this man.\n",
      "\n",
      "WRITING\n",
      "\n",
      "So this isn’t exactly a retelling of Dr Jekyll and My Hyde, it takes its inspiration from it and twists it into something entirely new. I loved Berthot’s writing, she really managed to get to the heart of every single scene. I loved how the period setting affected the characters and how Elliot came to realise due to his emotions a lot of the propaganda young men are still taught today – that women don’t feel lust, for example. I loved how spot-on all of the emotions Elliot was feeling were described, especially those of other people whose motivation we might not yet have discovered. It definitely made the book re-readable. The whole thing was easily digestible – not exactly light and fluffy, because there are definitely trigger issues in there, but it flowed smoothly and was easy to follow. In fact, I pretty much guessed the big reveal pretty early on but there were enough twists to keep me guessing the results and fallout of other issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "PACING\n",
      "\n",
      "Spot on. I had to stop reading due to another review book being due but I was always eager to come back to this story while at the same time I tried to read it slower than usual because I didn’t want it to end. It felt high-stakes all the way through and the slower moments were a chance to catch my breath and reflect on what I’d learned and try to predict what might come next – which I often didn’t. I will mention the inevitable romance – it did seem, like most YA, a little on the fast side, but taking into account the fact that Elliot can feel what others feel and Iris can control what she feels, it’s understandable the two should fall in love with such intensity, and I didn’t have an issue with it at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "OVERALL\n",
      "\n",
      "I am completely and totally blown away by this book. I absolutely loved it. It’s not one that I would normally pick up looking at the (admittedly pretty, but dark) cover and (admittedly bland until you know what it’s referencing) title, but I am so so glad I did because I had a really great time reading it, falling in love with the characters and becoming invested in their story and outcomes. I am totally up for reading the second book, which from what I gather follows Philomena as she trots off to Manhattan to become a Broadway star.\n",
      "\n",
      "I received this book for free from the author in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: Andrea Berthot and I started mutually following each other after I started reading this book. I'm pretty sure I'm going to make her be my friend (my precious), but I don't want anyone getting any ideas about me rating 'my friend's book' 5 stars. It's not being friends with Andrea that made me love her book: it's the other way around.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "5 Stars\n",
      "\n",
      "Full Review:\n",
      "Ok, people, do not let my apparent calmness in this review fool you because I would give this book 6 stars if I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was one of the best books I have ever read. There is not a single thing I would change about it, not a single thing I disliked, not a single thing that was lacking. I couldn’t even function after reading it because how do you function after being blown away like that?!\n",
      "\n",
      "But since books are subjective and everyone reading this doesn’t know what my personal preferences are, I will tell you all about I loved it so much! I will even organize it so that you can find exactly what you’re looking for, since this might be long (not even sorry). So here goes!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Emotion\n",
      "Emotion is what I read for. The deeper and stronger, the better. And this book was emotion on steroids because the main character was an empath, and I have never before read a book by an author who was able to describe the emotions an empath was feeling in such a strong, powerful, beautiful way. The sheer amount of emotions in the book, and the rawness and power of them, everything from love to shame to fear to rage, was just phenomenal. I felt like I was going to burst into tears for no apparent reason while reading because the sappy parts of me couldn’t even handle it. And since the protag was an empath, I got to know and feel not just his emotions but those of ALL the characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Characters\n",
      "Not only were they likeable, they were unique and developed. Elliot made a great protagonist because he was vulnerable, somewhat broken, and having difficulty coping (I do love me a tortured hero), but he was also understanding and used his ability to learn and grow. My favorite though was Cam because he was just so damn genuine, enthusiastic, and lovable!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Relationships\n",
      "There were straight and LGBT relationships, and both were healthy and adorable. Yes the main characters fell in love quickly, and normally I might be bothered by that, but I didn’t even notice it in this book until I stopped to think about it afterward. It just worked with the situation and the characters, especially since they were so supportive of each other. But the great relationships didn’t stop there. The friendship between Elliot and Cam was deep and full of love, and neither was afraid to express their care for the other—male friendships like that are not something I see often in books. There were even some complex family relationships that weren’t perfect but grew by the end of the story. And I was just as invested in the side characters as I was the main ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Messages\n",
      "I couldn’t help but love the feminism and LGBT support, as well as the overall point about understanding others. I’ll let these two quotes do the talking for me. (I took the names out of the second one, but it could still possibly be a spoiler.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Writing Style\n",
      "The best way I can describe it is that it was light and easy to read, but with a slight beautiful/historical infusion. And I abso-freaking-lutely loved it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Plot\n",
      "The book was more character-driven, but the plot was nicely paced and kept me interested and invested in every single scene. It flowed naturally with ups and downs, building up to the ending, which had me at the edge of my seat. My favorite scene was definitely the one when they listened to the ragtime music. I played the actual songs (which you can find in the author’s playlist) in the background while they were singing, dancing, drinking, joking, and laughing, and I swear I could feel the joy and the hope as if I were right there with them!\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything Else\n",
      "Not only was this an interesting premise (it’s not exactly a retelling, but it was inspired by Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) and a story filled with creativity, it was so rich with details—but not the kind that bog you down, just the kind that make a story come alive!\n",
      "\n",
      "This book was emotional, intense, surprising, and, most of all,\n",
      "\n",
      "*Note: This is part of a series, but it is a complete story about these main characters that works as a standalone.*\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyone who likes EMOTION in their books! Also fans of historical fantasy, character-driven novels, and adorable relationships and friendships.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Doctor Jekyll’s experiment had gone bad, but that is nothing compared to abominations that where created by the power hungry men, in society, that have gotten hold of Jekyll’s formula. London lies in ruin with Great Britain’s monarchy leaving the city in control of the Governor. The only hope comes in a scarred young scientist that flees to America as London falls. This scientist, Jekyll’s prodouche, just happens to a woman, who must make the dangerous trek with her young daughter, Iris Faye, into a city littered with monsters in disguise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some 13 years after the quarantine, the son of the lead physician and “cure seeker”, Elliot finds himself irrevocably drawn to Iris, a waitress at a local eatery. This chance meeting and continuing interactions seals their fate to either doom London or find its cure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The heart-eating monsters, of the twisted Jekyll potion, have nothing on the political machinations that abound with power hungry evil perpetrated, for years, unchecked on the citizen left behind in London.\n",
      "\n",
      "takes place in the early 1900’s but has the feel of a modern day urban fantasy. Berthot masterfully writes a science fiction fantasy with a small steampunk flare that captivates and charms us right into her storytelling. Original twist on the Jekyll tale, I recommend to any avid fiction reader.\n",

      "What is love? How do you fall in love? These questions could be answered in the book Twilight, Eclipse by Stephenie Meyer. It is about a girl who has to make a choice, and if she makes the wrong choice, she could ruin her life. It is an excellent book that shows love, romance, drama, revenge, and a lot of action!\n",
      "In the book Twilight, Eclipse by Stephine Meyer, Bella is in love with Edward, but she is still thinking that she is in love with Jacob as well. All Bella wants is to be happy, but she also wants to have a normal life. She could never have a normal life because she likes a were wolf and a vampire. She also has graduation coming up as well. The biggest things in her life are graduation and picking between Edward and Jacob.\n",
      "I felt like the book Twilight, Eclipse, by Shephine Meyer, had made me a more thoughtful person. The book inspired me to become more careful when I start falling in love. You don’t know who likes you and what they would do to get into your heart. This book is full of love, romance revenge and a lot of drama! I would recommend this book to anyone who is a Twilight fan, and who likes to read about love, romance, drama and revenge – if you like all of those things, twilight is the perfect book for you. This is a great book; you should give it a chance!\n",

      "This third Twilight Saga movie companion is even better than the second one. I think they get better the longer the movies and books go on. This is better written and again has better, more professional pictures.\n",
      "As with the second one, I think this movie was better and it seemed like it was two or three different stories in one. I prefer (usually) movies or stories like that. I think they are more interesting (again usually). Sometimes stories are confusing when they have too many storylines.\n",
      "These books could be really good, if the author wouldn't talk so much about one thing, for so long. It's weird, I find books that others find stupid interesting and books that I find stupid or boring others enjoy.\n",
      "Some of my favorite pictures in this book were: When Bella and Edward are in the meadow, The graduation and after party, and the pictures of Edwards room, you know when he asks Bella to marry him.\n",
      "I think Eclipse is probably my favorite book and movie out of the whole series. One reason why I like Eclipse so much is, I like that a lot happens in that book. I also like how much Carlisle (my favorite character) is in the book. I do like how much he is in Breaking Dawn as well.\n",

      "I thought this anthology was great. I had never really read any works by any of the authors mentioned before and would have to credit this collection of short stories as my first introduction to Russian literature. Below is the list of the short stories that are included in this anthology - I put a ♥ next to my favorite ones.\n",
      "The Queen of Spades by Alexander Pushkin - A poor man begs an old woman for her secret to winning games. Shows how poor people can be possessed by greed if they have the opportunity to.\n",
      "♥ - An insignificant person saves up his money for a new cloak. He gets a new one, but it gets stolen. He dies soon afterwards, but haunts people and takes their cloaks.\n",
      "♥ - A doctor visits a young woman who he falls in love with. She, knowing that she will die soon, falls in love with him, just so she can love someone before she dies. She dies, and the doctor is seen recollecting this story to another one of his patient (sort of like , if you get what I mean).\n",
      "♥ - A man settles himself a marriage with a girl when she is around 10 or 11, knowing that when she does get married, the husband will get a lot of money. Another man witnesses him being cold and cruel to him, later on he sees the man getting married to the girl.\n",
      "♥ - A man is accused of murdering someone and goes to jail, although he is innocent. Years later, a man shows up in the jail who is the actual murderer. He pleads guilty but by the time the innocent man is allowed out of jail, he is already dead.\n",
      "- Two officials find themselves on an island, but they know so little that they can't survive on an island, even though it has plenty of food. So a Muzhik (peasant) has to cook for them, and later he makes a vessel for them to ride back home. The best part about the story is the last bit, about how the police officers give peasant some money and a beer, and then he sets off happily. The two officials basically knew nothing, the peasant had to do everything for them, and he felt grateful for the little amount of money that he got!\n",
      "- I wasn't very interested in this story. It was about Socrates in Athens, and it raised quite a few thought-provoking points though.\n",
      "♥ - The ending is terrifying. That is all I can say.\n",
      "- A woman who is always in need of some love. She is without an opinion if she doesn't have anyone to love, basically. However, she becomes a widow a few times. Finally, she falls in love with a little boy who treats as her own son. I felt that there was supposed to be some significance in the last line, but I didn't get it.\n",

      "Indeed these are some of the very best short stories from Russian literature, which I have loved since I was a little girl. Gogol with his wittiness, Chekhov with his brutal satires, and Gorky's beautiful descriptions; it just does not get any better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will admit that loving the Russian novel is rather difficult, for it is a commitment that many are not willing to make; you enter into a contract to learn of excruciating detail of each character; some that are of great significance, and some that are merely a trifle and make no effect on the novel. They are long and require a sharp memory, and very very rich vocabulary. The Russian short story though, is so very easy to fall in love with and dedicate a lifelong commitment to. These stories offer social commentary, history, political criticisms, and such beauty in prose, all in a small number of pages bursting with readers' enjoyment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Russian short story writer offers you the inside story of those whom you are not; but it isn't a story someone else is telling you about those strangers, no, it is those very strangers telling you their story themselves. Each story is original, organic, and extremely painfully honest to a point that your tears may be jerked out of your sockets. What you will find here, my friend, you will not anywhere else. These stories are sincere and will touch your heart. Don't forget that the Russian writer did not have the luxury of expressing exactly what he thought, being under censorship from one regime or another over centuries, and therefore we get these painful- and weirdly enough, funny- stories, with much a hint about one or two things not clearly stated in the storyline.\n",

      "\n",
      "Background: I was a student at a conservative Quaker college in 1998.\n",
      "\n",
      "During mid-semester break in the fall, I went out to Enterprise, Oregon with my friend Chris, a copy of my college’s lifestyle agreement, and a sharpie. The Challenge issued me by Chris was to spend the weekend with old and new friends away from the school just being myself instead of the person I was trying to force myself to be. He, in turn would mark off each lifestyle agreement I violated by simply behaving like Clack.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I met Chris at his Mom’s house. She is a minister of the Church of Inner Light and reads auras. She read mine as a preparation for the trip (violation 1- “no member shall participate in cult or occult activities”). I told her that I thought her “reading” of me was a crock of cr*p (violation 2- “avoid mean-spirited behaviors”). She took it well though because she’s cool like that. So, Chris and I set out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once in Enterprise we stayed with my former boyfriend (ehem. violation 3- “we believe that only marriage between a man and a woman is God's intention for the joyful fulfillment of sexual intimacy”). However, he and I had split on terms that weren’t the best so we were actually quite angry with each other (still violation 3- “this should always be in the context of mutual compassion, love, and fidelity”. Also violation 4- “avoid abusive or manipulative actions”).\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterward, I got to meet his more recent ex (violation 5- “regard each person with love and respect” and 6- “avoid discrimination”). She was pretty p*ssed off because of course she was trying to get him back. She tried to make sure that I understood just how much better she was for him than I by showing me a tape she’d convinced him to make while they were together (violation 7- “we avoid giving attention to what is obscene and pornographic”). Frankly, I couldn’t see why she thought that’d convince me she was better.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day we went to Ex’s buddy John’s house where everyone was sitting around creating characters for an epic-level D&D game, drinking, and smoking. I joined in all activities listed (violations 8, 9, &10- “the use of alcohol by traditional undergraduate students is not allowed at any time they are enrolled at the university”, “presence or use of illegal drugs is not tolerated”, and “the use of tobacco is not permitted”).\n",
      "\n",
      "John asked me how things were going and I gave him a few juicy details (violation 11- “avoid gossip”). When Ex asked what we were talking about, I said “nothing”, because I didn’t want him to know what a crotch his other ex had been to me (violation 12- “tell each other the truth”). I’m glad that I talked to John though, because he was a big help to me in creating my character for the game. He let me fudge the numbers to get a more powerful setup (violation 13- “do honest work”).\n",
      "\n",
      "We played in the smoky room until early the next morning and then stumbled back to Ex’s place. I tripped on the way and hurt my leg. When we got back, he gave me some Percocet that he had left over from an old car accident (violation 14- illegitimate use of prescription drugs is not tolerated). It helped but I was dragging when it was time to get up. Fortunately for me, Ex was ADHD and had some stuff to perk me up too (violation 14 again). We just sat around that day playing cards (violation 15- “we avoid gambling”).\n",
      "\n",
      "When Ex and I parted, we promised to keep in touch more, try to get together more often, etc. (violations 16 & 17- “honor each person” and “keep our promises”).\n",

      "All in all, it was a fun, albeit personally instructive, weekend.\n",

      "1. The UFO cult that he appears to proseletyse for is a big\n",

      "chapter detailing \"Bob\"'s background provides information helpful to breaking the code. A list of prophecies contains bogus events interspersed with real ones, and the distinction is made by a difference in typeface. Also in this list, all events are off by one year.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all this in mind, get your fists around a copy of \"The Book of the Subgenius\". You'll most likely find it to be the best exposition around of not only What's What but also Why and How the What's What became a TOP SECRET.

      "\n",
      "In its more \"serious\" moments it espouses a sort of discordian daoism. The main goal of a SubGenius is to acquire Slack. Slack is pretty much Dao, amended for a chaotic universe and pathologically lazy, oppositional, or uncooperative people. Wikipedia accurately summarizes Slack: \"Slack is about finding satisfaction with what you have and who you are, as opposed for searching for satisfaction in accomplishment.\" This is the most valuable actual philosophical point in the book imo.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general the philosophy is very paradoxical. Glorifies truth and falsehood, life and death. Sometimes I feel like this is to poke fun at what religions do, and other times I feel like its trying to make a Postmodern point. If you asked one they'd probably say something trite to the effect of \"its both and its neither hurr durr\". But as awful as these noodly bastards are, they are sort of awfully correct if you just read what they *aren't quite* saying. Gah now I'm doing it goddamnit.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "There’s long been a rumour circulating on the Web about this book: that both it, and the SubGenius Foundation which produced it back in the 1980s, were in reality the handiwork of the CIA on behalf of the shadowy “elite” the book itself talks about. I mean, how better to conceal The Truth than by lampooning it?\n",
      "    The Foundation was a new cult, deliberately incorporating every nutty idea you’ve ever read about or just heard of—from crank diets to UFOs from the Hollow Earth—and its rather ambiguous Messiah was J R “Bob” Dobbs, formerly a salesman. In a nutshell (so to speak) “Bob” informs us that: the Earth and its inhabitants are under the control of an alien entity; that there’s a global Conspiracy among the world’s “elite” to keep this fact from the public; but that, by following “Bob”’s teachings (and, of course, sending him money) we can (and I quote) learn to “pull the wool over eyes” at last. The first thirteen chapters are a round-up of “Bob”’s revealed “wisdom”; the remaining ones tell us what to actually do (and where to mail the cheques) now we’re enlightened.\n",
      "    This was all good clean fun too back then, getting a rise out of the Scientologists and Moonies—a great idea. The downside is that, inevitably, the actual text of this book becomes every bit as boring after a while as the relentless outpourings of the cults and religions it’s satirising. On the other hand though, it’s lifted by the hundreds of clip-art illustrations, done like the small-ads in magazines and some of which are hilarious. What’s most striking of all perhaps, reading it in the twenty-first century, is how prescient it now looks—you find exactly these sort of “global conspiracy” ravings all over the Web.\n",
      "    And the true message of SubGenius? It was (and still is) telling us humans, “Will you please, PLEASE, just stop taking yourselves so damn seriously.”\n",

      "==============\n",
      "One of the most important books ever written. It's up there with Hobbes' Leviathan, Joyce's Ulysses, The Phantom Tollbooth and See Spot Run. It is even more important and timely than the latest book from the latest Republican or Democrat flavor of the month.\n",

      "I have been on a complete book buying ban because of my humongous TBR and yet I am able to find ways of getting my hands on free books. What is it with me and hoarding?! I just cannot help, I'm sorry, not really. Well, this e-book got into my hands through one of my daily mailing subscription of free e-books. The title caught my interest as it is clearly a jab at hypochondriacs, named humorly as hippochonriac. So basically, this is an illustrated story book that features a hippo suffering from hypochondriasis. For someone who has some knowledge to the illness hypochondriasis, I was able to appreciate the snapshot of the turmoil and panic an individual suffering from the illness goes through. However, I would say that this book was in shambles. If you picked this up with zero knowledge of the illness, you would pass it off as totally incomprehensible and bizarre. So, in that respect, it is not a good introduction to the illness itself. I also didn't get the humor in the book. I might be dense but I just did not get it. I was confused more than half of the time. Illustrations were also meh. If not for the added empathy bestowed upon me through this book, this would've been a 1 star.\n",

      "I guess this type of book isn't my favorite. I sort of got it and laughed pretty loudly at some points. I was even able to think of people in my life to compare to the characters. I was about to not do the review because I didn't know what to say about it other than it was sort of funny and the pictures are great. Then my 17 year old son began to read it when I left it open. I could hear him laughing two rooms away. I was like huh? This book was his cup of tea. His sense of humor is much different then mine. So this is his review:\n",
      "\n",
      "This book was great. The drawings were funny and went along with the entire book. It even had a lesson in it. No matter what is trying to hold you back you should always be there for a friend. It also kind of made me think of bullying. The Hippo just wanted friends and he found a place he was accepted and loved. I didn't blame him for not wanting to go back to his old home where they treated him like crap.\n",

      "\"Hippochondriac\" is about a hippo that is a hypochondriac. He thinks he has many sicknesses and that is robbing his life. Any rumors of diseases makes him think he has them also and that causes him fear. He bandages himself up thinking he has been hurt. Nobody wants to hang around him because his life is about being sick. He can't seem to concentrate on anything but his imaginary sicknesses and he feels sorry for himself way too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a fun book to help children learn what hypochondriacism is. I imagine it happens to different people around us we know, children and adults, and we may even be one ourselves. I think reading this book to children would be a good way to teach the differences with people that think they are sick and have made up imaginary sicknesses in comparison with people that really are sick. I think we can also get so stuck in our real health problems that people do not want to hang around us, even if people do not know we have any. I think it's in our attitudes sometimes. The ending surprised me and I think it will surprise some children too.\n",

      "In this short story/e-book by Micky Morag, there is a baby hippo who's a hypochondriac and he really thought that he was dying. The other kid animals aren't allowed to hang around him, due to that they might catch whatever illness or disease he thought that he had. He is friends with a fox who constantly repeat the same phrase multiple times, to the point of being annoying. He meets a little ostrich whose mother kicks Hypochondriac into another land where he's accepted. The little ostrich gets sick, and they want Hippochondriac to come back. He's not real keen on going to where he's not wanted.\n",

      "They always say \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" and this book is no exception. It might look like a children's story but I assure you, this book is geared more toward young adult / adult humor. The pictures were geared toward a child while the writing is geared toward a grownup. Its a quirky and well illustrated book with a lot of word play throughout. This is the story about a baby hippo that was called Hippochondriac and he was ABSOLUTELY SURE that he was dying. As a result no one wants to be around him and he looses friends because after all who wants to hang around a person who is negative and and saying that they have all kinds of sickness.\n",

      "As many deeply conservative societies have discovered time and time again - societies in which there is only one right order and this order is warranted by the highest authorities recognized by the society - when change comes, and come it always must,(*) not only do those in power tumble, but the authority of the gods/priests, ancestors, laws, whatever the highest authorities happen to be in that society, comes into question. New myths, new gods/priests, new stories must be told to justify and establish, reassure and mollify the people whose ideological or religious supports have been pulled out from beneath them. In the city of Athens during the Golden Age, this was done in the - the marketplace - and in the theaters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his lifetime Aeschylus (ca. 525 - 456 BCE) witnessed the invasion of Attica by huge Persian armies, the bold abandonment of the fortified city of Athens and withdrawal, twice, of the Athenian people behind the wooden walls of the Athenian navy, and the multiple defeats of the Persians and their allies (including other Greeks) by the hugely outnumbered Athenians and their Greek allies.(**) He also witnessed the political transition from tyranny to isonomy to democracy in Athens and the concurrent growth of Athens from just another small, unimportant Greek city-state to major power. He himself contributed greatly to the transition of Greek tragedy from a religiously inspired performance/rite involving a chorus and a single actor to something we his distant descendants can recognize as powerful theater.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the transition from tyranny to democracy, when first the middle class (essentially landowning farmers and artisans) and then the lower class (the ) acquired a direct voice in Athenian politics, political activity was carried out not only in the the popular assembly and the Council of Five Hundred, but it was also performed on stage.\n",

      "Indeed, the theater was so important in Athenian public life that plays were produced at all the most important public festivals and addressed conflicts troubling the Athenian policy makers; the populace flocked to see them and talk about them. In 461 BCE the last step to democracy in Athens was initiated with the stripping of all but ritual responsibilities from the Aeropagus, a body of men drawn essentially from the city's aristocracy. The lower and middle classes formed the overwhelming majority on the remaining decision making organs of the state and were therefore in power, for a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "Curiously enough, while all this innovation was going on, in Athens one of the most damaging epithets was \"innovator.\" So the men who willed the demotion of the Aeropagus, led by Ephialtes (who was later murdered for his trouble), had to argue that the Aeropagus had usurped its powers (quite false) and thus the removal of the aristocrats from the center of power was a return to the (even more false - but we all know that democratic decision-making has precious little to do with the truth). The Athenians needed a more efficacious justification for this change. They also needed a soothing of the many riled spirits brought about in the populace by all these changes. In the (***) first performed in 458, Aeschylus did all of this and much, much more.\n",

      "During this Golden Age playwrights wrote trilogies, which were intended, performed and perceived by audiences as coherent wholes. The is the only one which has come down to us intact. The three plays are structured together with both dramatic and ideological intent.\n",

      "At the end of the Trojan War, Agamemnon returns victorious to his palace. But ten years earlier, in order to thwart the will of Artemis and still the fierce winds keeping the fleet on the Greek shore, he had sacrificed his daughter, Iphigenia, and his wife, Clytemnestra, has neither forgotten nor forgiven. She slays him horrifically, and now it is their son, Orestes, who is obliged by the received morality to revenge his father by killing his mother. High drama and madness ensues, but behind all that excitement is the structure of Aeschylus' purpose - justify the new order, the new morality.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the very outset of the trilogy the chorus recalls that even the gods have changed and changed again, from the rule of Ouranos through that of Kronos to Zeus with son killing father before the father could do the same to the son. And one cannot be sure of doing the right thing by obeying a god, since the gods themselves disagree about right and wrong. Uncertainty has been established: perhaps the received ways are mutable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not going to try to summarize the complicated plot and recall the many striking characters. From this beautiful, moving and complex masterpiece I just want to draw out here the one theme I've been working on in this review. When Orestes kills Clytemnestra at Apollo's urging, the Erinyes, the Furies - representing the old order, the old morality - hasten to avenge the matricide by tearing Orestes apart. But Apollo and Athena, representing the new order and morality, intervene. The passages involving the Furies are particularly haunting, both dramatically and poetically. The new order is confirmed with a trial in which Athena casts the deciding vote - Orestes is acquitted. Athena convinces the Furies to accept the verdict, and they are then given a place of honor (though not power) and agree to ensure the city's prosperity. The old is replaced by the new, honored and bound into the all's well that ends well (except for the house of Atreus). Despite Aeschylus' efforts, Athens' new democracy did not last long, but that is another story...\n",

      "Murder, betrayal, revenge, torment . . . you might wonder, “Why would I bother reading three Greek plays when I could see the same sort of lurid problems on an episode of Jerry Springer? And fold laundry at the same time??” Two possible answers: First, you’re not going to get patricide, matricide, human sacrifice and unintentional cannibalism on daytime TV because we still draw the line somewhere, and you have to admit those are pretty dramatic. More importantly, though, along with the dysfunction in the House of Atreus comes a searing examination of guilt, retribution, and justice. It’s a lot of philosophical bang for your buck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first play in the trilogy, , sets up the conflict for the remaining two. Agamemnon returns home from the Trojan War to his wife, Clytemnestra, who has spent the last ten years plotting revenge because he sacrificed their daughter to appease a god at the outset of the journey. The verbal interplay at their reunion is the stuff of English majors’ dreams. Clytaemnestra’s subsequent murder of Agamemnon, with the help of a lover who has his own history with Agamemnon, is the stuff of Mafia dreams – though actually I’m only guessing on that one. However, Clytaemnestra’s revenge creates the conflict that drives the other two plays and generates the ethical conundrum Aeschylus ultimately wants to solve. For now Clytaemnestra’s son, Orestes, needs to avenge his father’s death . . . but what happens if you kill your own mother? And how is the cycle of revenge ever supposed to end??\n",
      "\n",
      "has Orestes debating what he should do, sort of like Hamlet, until the advice of his sister and the chorus women wins the day. . . and that’s when the excitement kicks up a notch. Clytaemnestra’s death at the hand of her son calls forth the avenging Furies — ancient goddesses of chthonic tradition who appear here as gorgon-like horrors, swathed in black, heads writhing with snakes. It’s so dramatic!! Also it’s fitting, for Clytaemnestra is like a Fury herself: in avenging her daughter’s death she acts within the old paradigm of blood ties that the Furies champion, wherein maternal claims are stronger than marital.\n",
      "\n",
      "So even though Orestes does his duty to avenge his father (in accordance with the current ethos), he’s pursed by snaky-haired horrors for killing his mother. Like his father, Orestes appears to be both an agent and a victim of fate, for in following the gods’ direction to avenge his father’s death, he both aligns himself with the Furies’ spirit of vengeance and becomes subject to it. Perhaps Orestes’ contradictory relationship with the Furies is Aeschylus’s commentary on a theology rife with snares and contradictions. In , Aeschylus resolves the problem, but his “solution” to the blood feud tradition is hardly unproblematic itself — read it and lose sleep! But you’ll know for sure why this is a masterpiece.\n",

      "The author is okay when he talks about the sexual revolt if you can get past the excurses in to art criticism, but there are far better books on that: the two Devlins (F Roger and Lord), Levin, Benatar, Domestic Tranquility, and even Gabrielle Kuby (to be read with discernment because she's a dysgenist).\n",

      "I read this book because it seemed like it would be an interesting companion to James Burnham’s “Suicide of the West.” Burnham’s book explains and analyzes the ideology of American liberalism, circa 1960. “The Devil’s Pleasure Palace” in a sense continues that story; it explains how that liberalism discovered the Critical Theory leftism of the Frankfurt School, and like Gollum discovering the One Ring, did not benefit from the discovery. “The Devil’s Pleasure Palace” is, indeed, somewhat interesting. But it generally fails at explanation and analysis, instead being mostly a rambling diatribe preaching to the converted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The core of Walsh’s book is an attack upon the Frankfurt School and its “Critical Theory.” The Frankfurt School was a group of Marxist German scholars, many from Goethe University’s Institute For Social Research in Frankfurt, who fled to the US before and after World War II, and then proceeded to repay this country’s generosity by deliberately destroying its culture. These men included Theodor Adorno, Erich Fromm, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse. They also include, in Walsh’s telling, indirectly, men like the Communist Antonio Gramsci (famous for calling for a “long march through the institutions,” though he did not use those exact words, to combat bourgeois “cultural hegemony”) and Georg Lukács, the Hungarian Communist (not to be confused with the writer John Lukács). The key principal of the Frankfurt School was that the existing culture of the West must be destroyed and replaced, because it is irrational and oppressive, originating in and containing nothing good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walsh’s premise is that the philosophy collectively promulgated by these men, Critical Theory, was a departure from earlier American liberalism, and a pernicious departure, that has since infected all America with its poison. This infection was accomplished through the adoption and application of the Frankfurt School’s social theories by legions of American-born radicals embedded throughout the key institutions of the West. To Walsh, Critical Theory is merely “cultural Marxism.” And, like economic Marxism, its goal is the destruction of the current society and its replacement by something new, better, and totally different. But instead of the workers being the driving engine, the educated classes would be. “They had been let down by the grubby, unwashed workers of the world, who largely rejected the great gift they had been offered; now they would approach their equals in the intelligentsia, a far more receptive and persuadable audience.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Among other core ideas of the Frankfurt School much in evidence today, for example in the frenzied demands for political correctness on campus and in the workplace, and in reactions to Donald Trump, is Marcuse’s “repressive tolerance”—the idea that real tolerance consists of intolerance of incorrect views. Or, as Wikipedia summarizes the idea, “Revolutionary minorities hold the truth and the majority has to be liberated from error by being re-educated in the truth by this minority. The revolutionary minority are entitled to suppress rival and harmful opinions.” But Marcuse’s idea is only one of many dubious gifts bestowed on modern America by the Frankfurt School—nearly any organized modern attack on American traditions is at least in part a result of the machinations of the Frankfurt School and its acolytes.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the degree and emphasis of Critical Theory was new in America, and its impact heightened by other cultural changes, the idea that the existing culture must continuously justify itself to reason and be replaced if rationally determined to be deficient, is as old as America, as seen in the debates between Thomas Paine and Edmund Burke. Attempts to undermine and destroy a society’s culture are nothing new in the post-Enlightenment world, though the Frankfurt School has been uniquely successful in having their corrosive ideas adopted through internal corruption rather than imposed by external force or actual revolution. True, what distinguishes adherents of the Frankfurt School is their nihilism, in that they are less interested in what the new society will be than in destroying the old. This is well covered by Walsh, but he does not tie his discussion to longer-term currents of American political thought, which would have made his analysis stronger.\n",
      "\n",
      "But linear discussion about the Frankfurt School is actually a small part of the book, and not particularly well developed. My summary above is pieced together. The rest of the book is a rambling series of asides relating political points to classical music, H.P. Lovecraft, Milton, movies from Chinatown to “The Wild One,” and numerous operas (the name of the book is from a Schubert opera). Many of these asides are mildly interesting, and what Walsh is trying to do is, through an artistic lens, tie the evils of Critical Theory to its opposition to the traditional “heroic narrative” of the West. However, the net result feels like a fairly confused mishmash—neither political analysis nor clear social commentary. There is certainly no clear exposition and refutation of the Frankfurt School, which is why I read the book to begin with. And, while most of the book is heavily pessimistic, oddly, Walsh concludes his book on an optimistic note. “No political victory is ever permanent,” and Walsh apparently believes that by returning to the heroic narrative and the explication of virtues, American conservatives can ultimately defeat the poison of Critical Theory. He doesn’t really say how, or develop this throwaway optimism, though. It’s just a jarring conclusion to an ambitious, but ultimately largely incoherent, book.\n",

      "If you want to understand where the Left is coming from, in other words, if you want to understand the rise of \"Cultural Marxism\", this book will be an indispensable introduction. Where economic Marxism was shown to fail, cultural Marxism has stepped into the void, and is at the base of the current trend towards intolerance and a host of anti-Western sentiments.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I hate to give this book such a poor review, but as an avid reader of Anne Helen Petersen's blog, and her columns on sites such as The Hairpin, this book was a HUGE letdown. For someone with little to no knowledge of the star system and old hollywood, \"Scandals\" is possibly a three star read. As a primer however, you are likely to learn more from reading wikipedia. For those of us classic hollywood junkies there is nothing here to interest you. There literally are dozens of books on these actors and the star system that created them/covered up scandals that go much deeper in depth than anything Petersen has written about here. For meticulously researched, and juicy hollywood history with legit historical analysis, check out anything written by Wesleyan University Film Historian Jeanine Basinger, she won't disappoint. Lastly, there are some painfully obvious errors that someone with a \"PhD in Celebrity Gossip\", should not have overlooked; such as her statements on Evelyn Nesbit and Montgomery Clift. Are we really still questioning whether Clift and Liz Taylor had a romantic relationship in 2014? Taylor herself has long cleared up that they were strictly platonic. After waiting with anticipation for this book to be released I was surprised how amateur it was.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I've been waiting for this book for six months-- and, like any Hollywood movie, it was bound to struggle to live up to the anticipation. Don't get me wrong; for any lover of classic hollywood, this is a good read, and I'd probably have loved it if I hadn't been devouring Anne Helen Peterson's online articles--whether through Hairpin, Buzzfeed, her blog, or other media--for a couple years now. But I have and therein, I think, lies the slight disappointment with the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the promos promise the chapters are not repeats of the Hairpin articles, that is a bit disingenuous. The articles aren't transplanted verbatim, but many of the stories (Fatty Arbuckle, Clara Bow Dorothy Dandridge, Montgomery Clift, and others) are repeats and cover familiar territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, a good story is always worth rereading. What I miss most in the book is the lively, irreverent, voice Peterson uses in her online pieces, which often read like a personal email to you, the reader. SHE IS FUNNY. Her side remarks on Hollywood hypocrisy and comments on the plethora of images that populate her online text are vastly entertaining and sadly missing in this text\n",

Do I need to live in the South, seduce some guy who comes to the diner owned by my old boring husband, and get him to kill said husband? \"\n",

      "Isn't that great? Doesn't it make you want to just hang with her, watching old movies and debating whether Joseph Cotton or Melvyn Douglas would be better movie star boyfriends?\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, there's too little of that in the book. While it's not academic, one can feel the influence and the self-restraint (believe me, I've written enough deadly literary analyses myself to know). There is an occasional glimmer of the old style, as in this sly comment on Marlon Brando's engagement: \"And as she [his fiancee] told the press, she didn't love Brando because he was a star, but as a man like any other. Plus, she was a 'sloppy dresser' with 'odd manners,' and the two had first met at his analyst's office--clearly, they were meant for each other.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, it's doubtless a monetary/copyright thing, but there's also an odd dearth of photographs--especially in the Kindle version that I read, which delegates the few images to the back of the book, where I only found them after I'd finished reading. A good part of the power in her online writing lies in the plethora of accompanying imagery, whether movie stills, shots of gossip mags or whatever. They not only allow the reader to visualize the commentary, but also engage in the analysis with AHP. Plus, as I said, her comments on the images are darned funny. That interaction is lacking in the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless it says something that I started reading this Tuesday night, and finished by 11 am Wednesday morning. And that I'm actually bothering to write a Goodreads review, which I don't usually do. It's a good and enjoyable read. AHP has really carved a niche for herself in her analysis of Hollywood semiotics and what it means for the rest of us. She takes gossip and makes it respectable.\n",

      "I'd definitely encourage you to head over to the Hairpin though, and spend a day reading the articles.\n",

      "UPDATE: I just finished reading some of the other reviews. In AHP's defense, I think many of the readers missed the point of the book, when they complain the incidents she cover aren't \"scandalous.\" As she states herself, the point of the book is Hollywood's manipulation of lives and media to its own interests, not just the relating of \"gossip.\" Moreover, it's not about whether we see these events as scandalous now, but about views and values THEN.\n",

      "\"THE INK OF THE SCHOLAR\"---THE ISLAMIC GOLDEN AGE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"Islamic Golden Age\" was an historical period beginning in the mid-8th century lasting until the Mongol conquest of Baghdad in 1258, generally associated with the rise of the Abbasid Caliphate around 750 AD, and the moving of the capital from Damascus to Baghdad, but also including contributions from remnant Ummayad kindgoms in Iberia (modern Spain and Portugul) and North-West Africa. The Abbasids were influenced by the Qur'anic injunctions and Hadith such as \"the ink of a scholar is more holy than the blood of a martyr\" that stressed the value of knowledge and reason, and were also more cosmopolitan than the Umayyads, being allied with the Persian Barmacids and less ethnocentrically focused on the narrower tribal culture of the Kureysh, the original tribe of Muhammad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise of Islam was instrumental in uniting the warring Arab tribes into a powerful empire. The Abbasids claimed authority as belonging to the same family and tribe to which the Prophet Muhammad belonged, and were for that reason considered holy. During this period the Arab world became an intellectual center for science, philosophy, medicine and education; the Abbasids championed the cause of knowledge and established the House of Wisdom (Bait-ul-Hikmat) at Baghdad, where both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars sought to translate and gather all the world's knowledge into Arabic, and also the second court language Persian.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Arabs displayed a remarkable capacity of assimilating the scientific knowledge of the civilizations they had overrun. Many classic works of antiquity that might otherwise have been lost were translated into Arabic and Persian and later in turn re-translated into Turkish, Hebrew and Latin. St. Thomas Aquinas, for example, gained crucial familiarity with the works of Aristotle through translations into Arabic and then into Latin accompanied by the commentary of the great Muslim Aristotelian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna).\n",
      "\n",
      "During this period the Arab world was a collection of cultures which put together, synthesized and significantly advanced the knowledge gained from the ancient Roman, Chinese, Indian, Persian, Egyptian, Greek, Byzantine and Phoenician civilizations. The decimal system and \"zero\" travelled from India into Arabic culture during this time and in 9th century it was popularized in the Islamic regions by the Persian mathematician al-Khwarizmi. Later in 12th century the renown Western monk Abelard introduced what Westerners call \"Arabic Numerals\" to Europe, but which the Arabs themselves termed \"Hindsi\" or \"Indian Numerals,\" indicating their true origin. They also began the use of Algebra and advanced logarithims in order to solve complex mathematical problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is little agreement on the precise causes of the decline in Arabic creativity and intellectual leadership ending the Islamic Golden Age, but in addition to the devastating invasion by the Mongols and crusaders with the destruction of libraries and madrasahs, it has also been suggested that political mismanagement and the stifling of \"Ijtihad\" (independent reasoning) in the 12th century in favor of institutionalised \"Taqleed\" (imitation and uncritical following of precedent) played a part.\n",

      "THE KORAN (QURAN) IN WORLD LITERATURE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Any understanding of the literatures of Islamic nations must begin with a familiarity with the Koran, just as any understanding of of Western Literature must include a basic familiarity with the Bible. Muslims believe the Quran to be verbally revealed through Angel Gabriel (Jibril) from God to Muhammad gradually over a period of approximately 23 years beginning from 609 AD, when Muhammad was 40, to 632 AD, the year of his death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Muslims regard the Quran as the main miracle of Muhammad, the proof of his prophethood and the culmination of a series of divine messages to humanity that started with the messages revealed to Adam, regarded in Islam as the first prophet, and continued with the Scrolls of Abraham (Suhuf Ibrahim), the Tawrat (Torah) of Moses, the Zabur (Tehillim or Psalms) of David, and the Injil (Gospels) of Jesus. The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in Jewish and Christian scriptures, summarizing some, dwelling at length on others and in some cases presenting alternative accounts and interpretations of events. The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance, sometimes offering detailed accounts of specific historical events, and often emphasizing the moral significance of an event.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of whether one believes or disbelieves in the Koran, equally as in the case of whether one believes or disbelieves in the Christian or Jewish Bible, it is an inescapable necessity for every educated person to read and be familiar with these works as literature if one has any hope of understanding World Literature, Western Literature, Islamic and Arabic Literature, English, French, German, Russian or any national literature of any culture affected by their influence. No one can understand English or American Literature without familiarity with the King James and other versions of the Bible, the words, phrases, style and stories and themes of which permeate and recur in Shakespeare, Donne, Milton, and a thousand believing and unbelieving authors and works. Similarly, any understanding of German Literature is impossible without knowledge of the Bible of Luther. The Koran thus takes its place in World Literature by virtue of its shaping influence on the mindset and consciousness of over one billion Muslims across dozens of nations, cultures and literatures as well as the cultural foundation of dozens of Muslim authors and works of worldwide importance such as Rumi, Attar, Hafiz, the Thousand and One Nights, Mafouz Naguib, Ghalib and others. Thus it is required reading, at least in part, for any Citizen of the Republic of Letters or of the modern world, alongside the Bible, the Buddhist Sutras such as the Fire Sermon, the Bhagavad Gita and the Dao De Ching, as part of the common heritage of mankind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to the Bible, the Koran is a much shorter work, lacking the extended historical accounts and chronicles of the Old Testament and the multiple repetitive Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John of the New Testament, and can be read in a relatively short time in translation by most people for basic familiarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic theme of the Koran is that of monotheism, an invocation to belief and adherence to the single God, Allah, of Muhammad, who is also conceived as the same God of the Christian and Jewish Abrahamic tradition, albeit with differences of understanding with the other religions. A good deal of the Koran is concerned with laying down rules of behaviour in common life, religious practice and society, as the Suras were broadly used for instruction of the Ummah, or new congregation of Islam in Mecca and Medina during Muhammad's life as he recited them. The Koran also contains repetitions of many famous Bible stories such as Adam and Eve, the Flood, Genesis, Exodus and life of Moses, the conception of Jesus by Mary and others. In the Koran Moses and Jesus are considered fellow prophets of Allah, though Jesus is not considered as the son of God as in the Bible. A large part of the Koran contains exhortations to belief in its one God Allah and adherence to its rules of behaviour, with the bliss of paradise as promised reward and certain damnation in Hell as the consequence of failure to do so. Similar to the Bible, a significant part of the Koran focuses on the coming Apocalypse, or end of time and the consequent Last Judgment of all souls.\n",

      "PRE-ISLAMIC ARABIC POETRY---AL-KHANSA, CELEBRATED WOMAN POET\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Even before Muhammad and the rise of Islam Arabic literature had developed a strong poetic tradition. At that time Arabic culture was largely based on oral tradition, with poetry at its center. For a nomadic people such as the Bedoin Arabs, poetry was the main reservoir of the people's knowledge and expression of their very existence. Poets were highly honored, attaining even what today we might term \"superstar\" status. The poetry was the poetry of the tribe or clan, articulating its legends, heroes, geneology, iteration of its strong \"tribal code\" of norms and exploits. Celebrated poets included traditionalists such as Imru 'al-Qays, the \"Brigand Poets\" or poets who individualistically broke with the control of their tribes and lived outside the tribal system, and the celebrated Pre-Islamic woman poetess Al-Khansa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Al-Khansa (575-646) put women in a central place in her poetry. A traditionalist in one sense, she wrote poems of lament for brave fallen heroes of her tribe, such as her fallen brothers, yet celebrated the women who remained alive and powerful in keeping life going and honoring and transmitting the proud warrior values to their children, despite the vicissitudes of battle, defeat and victory. She made women's role in the symbolic order potent and visible, even in a patriarchal tribal society.\n",

      "HAFIZ---FATHER OF THE GHAZAL GENRE OF LOVE POETRY\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hafiz is the pen name of the Persian poet Shams al-Din Muhammad Shirazi who is celebrated as the originating master of the \"ghazal,\" a form of poetic artistic unity which is neither thematic nor dramatic in the Western sense, but consists in the creation of a poetic unity by weaving imagery and allusions round one or more central concepts, of which both divine and sexual love are the most common. Hafiz was a master of interweaving the erotic and the mystic through superb linguistic craftsmanship and intuitive insight. Some stanzas from his \"The House of Hope\" give some feel for his themes, often sensual and melancholy:\n",
      "\n",
      "The house of hope is built on sand,\n",
      "And life's foundations rest on air;\n",
      "Then come, give wine into my hand,\n",
      "That we may make an end of care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look not to find fidelity\n",
      "Within a world so weakly stayed;\n",

      "A thousand bridegrooms had betrayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take not for sign of true intent\n",
      "Nor think the rose's smile sincere;\n",
      "Sweet, loving nightingale, lament:\n",
      "There is much cause for weeping here.\n",
      "\n",
      "What envying of Hafiz's ease,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Abu-Nawas (755-815) is perhaps the most beloved of Arab poets of any period. He appears repeatedly as a character in the classic \"One Thousand and One Nights,\" or \"Arabian Nights\" along with the renown Abbasid Caliph Haroun al-Rashid and his Barmacid Vizir Jafar. He is the archetypal sensual, erotic and profligate poet and Baghdad court favorite of the Caliph. He wrote pangyric poetry as well as heterosexual and homosexual ghazals, and handled Bacchic poems of \"wine, women and song\" with incomparable skill. He wrote with an existential edge to his Epicurean ethos that embraced every kind of pleasure and satisfaction. His death is a subject of legend, some saying he died in prison for writing blasphemous verse, others that he died in a whorehouse, some saying he was murdered in reprisal for lampooning a powerful court personage, and still others that he died peacefully in his sleep in the home of a learned Shi'ite scholar.\n",

      "Jalal al-Din Rumi (1207-1273) was renown as both the foremost Sufi mystic poet and the founder of the Mavlevi sect of Sufi dancing dervishes. Originally an academic scholar and professor, he was persuaded by a wandering Sufi mystic, Shams al-Din Tabrizi, to take up the Sufi life and put the love of God at the center of his existence. Striving after divine illumination in diverse ways, from devout meditation to the ecstatic pleasures of wine, sexuality and the Dervish entrancement of dance, he emphasized a devotion to a spiritualized love that disregards rites and convention and concentrates on inner feeling and approach to the ecstatic infinite. His odes have been chanted by Hadjj pilgrims on the road to Mecca for centuries and are sung with the greatest reverence even today.\n",

      "Abu Uthman 'Amr ibn Bahr (776-868) of Basra, Iraq was known as \"Al-Jahiz\" or \"the goggle eyed\" due to a malformation of his eyes and was one the dynamic personalities in the Mu'tazilite circles, which met regularly in Basra reminiscent of the famous \"salons\" of Paris. Basra was also the location of the annual Al-Mirbad literary festival of Arab and Islamic culture that took place yearly featuring competitions and debates on philosophical issues, and at which he was renown for his wit, cutting humor, endless anecdotes and depth of knowledge. His book \"Spiritual Leadership\" was praised at the court in Baghdad by the Caliph al-Mamun, who appointed him as court scribe, personal secretary and speech writer. His monumental work the \"Book of Animals\" is the first encyclopedia on animals and zoology. His most famous work is the \"Book of Misers\" which is a unique portrait gallery of human characters rich in their contradictions and ironies. It features an acute analysis of the passion of avarice, satirical and comic narratives, and cutting insight into human psychology. If the Eighteenth Century is sometimes called the Age of Voltaire, the Ninth Century in the Abbasid Caliphate could be called the \"Age of Al-Jahiz\"\n",

      "THE GREAT PHILOSOPHERS OF THE ARAB GOLDEN AGE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If Classical Greece had the great triumvirate of Aristotle, Plato and Socrates in the realm of philosophy, the Islamic Golden Age featured Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Rushd (Averroes) and Ibn Arabi. Ibn Rushd and Ibn Sina played a major role in saving the works of Aristotle, whose ideas came to dominate the non-religious thought of both the Christian and Muslim worlds. They would also absorb ideas from China and India, adding to them tremendous knowledge from their own studies. Ibn Sina and other speculative thinkers such as al-Kindi and al-Farabi combined Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through Islam. Avicenna argued his famous \"Floating Man\" thought experiment, concerning self-awareness, where a man prevented of sense experience by being blindfolded and free falling would still be aware of his existence, perhaps a forerunner of Descartes \"cogito ergo sum\"----\"I think therefore I am.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ibn Arabi was the foremost advocate of metaphysical Sufism, as expressed in his magnum opus \"Bezels of Wisdom\" which transformed Islam's personal God into a principle of absolute being, where all is God and God is all, in which humanity in his Sufist interpretation, occupies a central role as revealed divine being, perhaps reminiscent of Bishop Berkeley's pan-idealism.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ibn Tufail (Abubacer) and Ibn al-Nafis were pioneers of the philosophical novel. Ibn Tufail wrote the first fictional Arabic novel \"Hayy ibn Yaqdhan\" (\"Philosophus Autodidactus\") as a response to al-Ghazali's \"The Incoherence of the Philosophers,\" and then Ibn al-Nafis also wrote a fictional novel \"Theologus Autodidactus\" as a response to Ibn Tufail's \"Philosophus Autodidactus.\" Both of these narratives had protagonists (Hayy in Philosophus Autodidactus and Kamil in Theologus Autodidactus) who were autodidactic feral children living in seclusion on a desert island, both being the earliest examples of a desert island story, a forerunner of Defoe's \"Robinson Crusoe.\" However, while Hayy lives alone with animals on the desert island for the rest of the story, like Mowgli in Kipling's \"Jungle Book\" in \"Philosophus Autodidactus,\" the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in \"Theologus Autodidactus,\" developing into a story of his re-entry into civilization, the earliest known coming of age plot and eventually becoming the first example of a science fiction novel.\n",

A great spiritual searcher, he attended debates and salons in Basra and Baghdad, then embarked on thirty years of wandering, perpetual fasting, meditation, contemplation and silence in search of Sufi enlightenment. His pilgrimage to Mecca led to further enlightenment and he began to attract large numbers of followers, breaking the normal Sufi practice of esoteric secrecy by public preaching, including reform of corrupt clerics. His movement was perceived as a threat by the highly corrupt religious establishment, and he suffered a fate similar to Jesus and the Apostles. Corrupt clerics accused him of blasphemy and he was imprisoned in Baghdad eight years, tortured, half-killed and exhibited on a scaffold. The Caliph, failing to force him to recant his beliefs, finally had him decapitated, burnt and his ashes scattered into the Tigris River.\n",

One of its characters Mohammad ala Rushdie is a novice Sufi of the Mevlevi Order, writer and also an activist for the creation of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly. He is taken hostage by terrorists and meets the Supreme Leader of Iran, later reciting to him a short story he has written \"The Supreme Leader and the Three Messiahs,\" reminiscent of Dostoyevski's \"The Grand Inquisitor\" set in an Islamic setting. Part of the plot of the novel involves a geopolitical conspiracy of an allied China-Russia-Iran to execute a Pearl Harbor-like sneak attack invasion of the Middle-East oil reserves to sever the \"oil jugular\" of the West, leading to a threatened WWIII. It is foiled by a cosmic quest of the protagonists intoa mythic dimension and a change of heart in the Iranian Supreme Leader following a visit of the Angel Jibreel (Gabriel) who commands him to \"Open the Gates of Ijtihad\" or creative reasoning against the tradition of blind precedent and conformity to the past as a means giving rebirth to the spirit of the lost Islamic Golden Age and preventing Armageddon and World War III.\n",

Seorang dengan pemikiran yang cukup mendobrak pada zamannya, baik itu secara sosial maupun relijius.\n",

      "I enjoyed this text but was somewhat disappointed because I thought I was getting a book that was a little more in depth. The book is obviously written for a younger audience than I am; it might be a good introduction for older children or pre-teens. It gives plenty of background and surrounding information, perhaps too much as information on Ibn Sina doesn't even start until page 31. For a book that's only 112 pages long (and a good 10 or 12 of those are references, research tools, or information presented in a different way) that strikes me as a bit much. The book also has large font, lots of artistry in it's layout around the edges of the pages, and many illustrations. Though I found these delightful, I would have preferred more and deeper information. Considering that the text is aimed at a younger audience this formatting is completely appropriate; I simply wasn't the person the book was aimed at.\n",

      "I listened to the audiobook version of this and it was excellent. Audiobooks are ruined for me if the reader tries to do a one-person performance as if the book is a stage play. This reader did enough to add value but without being annoying. And the overall story (a realistic, everyday life version of the zombie apocalypse) was a refreshing take on the genre.\n",

      "I ended up really liking this book. I stumbled upon this series quite by accident while I was browsing Audible. I am a huge Walking Dead fan so I thought this looked promising and decided to give it a try. This was a story that I liked more and more as I continued to read. I listened to the audiobook for hours at a time and never tired of the story. I am so glad that I took a chance with this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book starts just as the trouble begins. Cassie and her friends live in New York City and there is a virus causing people to get sick. The group quickly figures out that things are a lot worse than they are being told and they make plans to get to Cassie's parents' home. Cassie's parents prepared for disasters and though they have both passed away the home is well stocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found that during the beginning stages of the book the focus was more on the drama between the characters than the zombie outbreak. I really wanted someone to smack a couple of Cassie's \"friends\" and move on to more zombie stuff. As the book progressed, I started seeing more and more of the zombie action that I had wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a rather large cast of characters to keep track of in this book but each of their personalities were well developed so it really wasn't too much of a problem. The characters do grow over the course of the book and the same characters that I wanted to feed to the zombies did end up redeeming themselves. I did end up liking the characters and wanted to see the whole group remain safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought that Julia Whelan did a great job with this story. She handled a large number of character voices very well. She put a lot of emotion into the reading of the story and made some of the scenes fell even more intense. She had a very pleasant reading voice and I look forward to listening to more of her work soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend this book to others. This may not have been the most original story but it was a lot of fun. I can't wait to see what is in story for Cassie and her friends in the next installment.\n",

      "\n",
      "I liked this one. At the beginning, I did have a few moments that I wanted more zombies and less drama but as things progressed that changed. I was very invested in the safety of these characters and wanted to see things work out. The narration in the audiobook was very well done and I am looking forward to listening to more of the series very soon.\n",

      "This book is about so much more than zombies. It's about family, friends, love, breakups and beer. The author had a large cast of characters to deal with but she was able to make each one of them feel like an individual. Each one was believable and independent. Sure they had similarities, but they were a tight knit group of friends; naturally there is overlap in opinions, tastes and voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even outside the topic of the world ending there were heavy subjects dealt with but it never felt like it weighed you down. It's an apocalyptic doom and gloom novel that keeps you grinning and cheering for the characters even after you finish reading it.\n",

Not one time did I get lost with who was who because the author did such a kick ass job of bringing these characters to life.

This group of 6 must avoid the zombies and the military in order to get to their destination.\n",

      "I've been struggling slowly through Less Than Hero for a number of days. It was one of the books contributing to my slump. Still, I wanted to finish it, because there's a lot that's very clever about this book. I really like the concept, which is superheroes as a social commentary on our pharmaceutical culture. That part is top notch.\n",
      "\n",
      "My problem lies in the characters. They're all flat and stereotyped, aside, maybe, from the first person POV MC, Lloyd, who is just kind of boring and unmotivated. Just now, I was thinking about this book and I realized that, not only was it a book with a whole lot of dude feels (which, believe me, I picked up on immediately), but that there is only one female character of note halfway through the book. That female character is Lloyd's girlfriend Sophie, who is almost literally a manic pixie. Like, she actually plays a fairy in the park and throws pixie dust on everyone. She's every bit the fairy, flower child who works at an organic grocery. THE ONLY FEMALE CHARACTER. It's not like there couldn't have been a couple of women in their group of drug testing friends.\n",

      "Less Than Hero is a fun new look at the superhero genre inspired by ridiculous drug side effects, human pharmaceutical testers and outcast superheroes like the Mystery Men, the X-Men and the duo in M. Night Shyamalan's only other good film: Unbreakable.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was also originally a short story entitled \"Dr. Lullaby\" in Browne's collection .\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you read Browne's second novel ? The two tales take place in the same universe -- modern day New York City-- and are occurring at the same time so be on the lookout for crossovers! that oddly enough he came up with ideas for both books at 10PM \"exactly 30 days apart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Less Than Hero's narrator is Lloyd Prescott, a man with no ambition who enjoys living a non nine to five lifestyle testing drugs for pharmaceutical companies (called guinea pigging) and panhandling for money on the streets of New York City, which includes taking money in exchange for being insulted by strangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also get a few interludes from the other guinea pigs Lloyd regularly keeps in contact with through a guinea pig support group, all of whom have been forced to test drugs for companies that pray on \"the poor, uneducated, and desperate\" so that those who afford new drugs get them.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's Charlie, the high school student who was forced to drop out to take care of his dying father and stepmother. A mishap with their wills left Charlie with no inheritance.\n",

      "Frank is the patriarch of the group who lost it all when his wife left him and took their joint business with her. He spent his entire divorce settlement at the racetrack.\n",

      "Finally, there's Isaac, the stuttering wannabee thespian who can no longer get work due to his speech problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before getting into testing, Lloyd was an independent contractor who lost his job. Unable to gain unemployment, he drained his life savings and took on two part-time minimum wage jobs to make ends meet before falling into the guinea pig life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike his fellow guinea pigs, Lloyd could return to the world of marketing -- his career five years prior -- but he lacks ambition, drive and instead chooses to sleepwalk through his existence, unsure of his place in the world, a fact which upsets his longtime girlfriend Sophie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, the individual members of the group begin to realize that they have developed the uncanny ability to cause spontaneous vomiting, seizures, rashes, erections, tiredness and sudden weight gain in others -- common side effects of on the market pharmaceuticals, which leads them to believe their years of drug testing has literally empowered them.\n",
      "\n",
      "With their super powers combined, the guinea pigs form a not-so elite group, first punishing the rude (loud cell phone talkers, people who don't hold open doors, those who are rude to food service workers) before moving onto protecting those who can't protect themselves: the homeless citizens of New York City.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with any superheroes, they eventually must deal with mighty foes: supervillains causing hallucinations and memory loss, and Lloyd must deal with the realization that he may have finally stumbled across his destiny as the very symbolic Dr. Lullaby.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "In Less Than Hero, S.G. Browne presents an entirely different take on the superhero genre than anything I have ever read before. Typically, superheroes have cool powers like the ability to fly, or super strength, or speed. In this novel, Lloyd and his band of heroes do things like put people to sleep, make them develop rashes all over their bodies, and blow up like human version of the Goodyear blimp. Not exactly an astounding array of powers. Not to mention the way they obtain their powers is quite odd, being the guinea pigs of pharmaceutical company clinical trials. And what would a superhero novel be without supervillains to counter them? In this case, the villains can steal people’s memories and create hallucinations. One thing is certain, Browne will never write a novel that isn’t entirely fascinating and interesting to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "As usual, Browne writes in an easy going and professional manner. It’s always a breeze to read his books, something I appreciate. The premise is full of intrigue. I like the development of the characters’ powers and how they go about using it. These are unconventional heroes so it’s fitting that they should have an unconventional way of developing and using their abilities. There’s a lot to like in this novel. One area that I thought it falls short is that there is a lot of social commentary about the role of pharmaceutical drugs and how they are used in society. I don’t have a problem with that, but I did think it was a little heavy handed, and it often took me out of the story because those sections were lengthy. This is a cool novel that you will want to read.\n",

      "Words cannot describe how much I enjoyed this novel. Just like with Fated, I wanted to keep notes from almost the first page so I could try to do a review some justice. I didn’t and really regret it, but maybe too much detail would make for spoilers. There is just so much to love about Lloyd. His personality is hysterical, yet so real I’m sure everyone will see a bit of themselves in him. His friends are a ton of fun as well. The one-liners are endless – I couldn’t count all the LOL moments. Less than heroes indeed, but what a fun story. I loved it from cover to cover. I really have to get on track & buy more of Scott’s books!\n",

      "I wanted more! I bought this ebook as soon I saw that it was available, after checking every month for the last several months. It's a little over 100 pages, which was a disappointment but still I thought, \"It's a new Kaitlyn O'Connor!\" I liked this book but didn't love it. The epilogue was a little long, maybe it could have just been a final chapter of the book. The romance, I don't know. Usually with this author's books the guys are clueless about how to romance a woman which I find endearing and you would think that since their world changed right when they were showing interest in the opposite sex they would be lumped into that clueless group. But no, they're grabby and they wink which is just strange to me. I dislike winkers in my real life so it's probably just my prejudice speaking. I'm hoping that the next book will be a lot better. I'm not giving up! 3-1/2 stars.\n",

They couldn’t run far enough or fast enough to elude the survivors bent on avenging those they’d lost.\n",

I felt a bit whiplashy there at the end. Plus it ended abruptly. Also usually normal for this author.

      "What I liked most about this book is that it talked about spiritual stuff, w/o being nihilistic and acknowledging that many theories within the spiritual/personal growth community were trash. I would call it honest, because although I did not agree with some of her ideas, I was able to respect her more because she didn't present this rosy-colored-over the top ideology that might neglect injustice.\n",

      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The most poignant thing about this book is the poem, 'The Invitation' upon which it is based. Oriah does a good job of expanding on each stanza in the poem with personal stories of heartbreak, illness, and love. She appears to be a bit cynical as she relates her views to that of new age thought and optimism. The poem, 'The Invitation' was for me the draw as it forces you to examine relationships--all relationships--and challenges you to explore the depths of them and to allow others to explore your own depths.\n",

      "Another beautiful and devastating piece of literature from Annie Baker. This one lends some poetry to the world's burnouts and the writing is just...it's just so so so so so good. Every one of her plays I've read, the dialogue just puts you RIGHT THERE. The plays are quiet and they are built on myriad silences (I believe this one has a note that says if the play isn't half silences and pauses, you're doing it wrong), but they are impossible to put down and unforgettable.\n",

      "A quite traumatic look at generational divides, the power of work ethic, and the (sometimes flawed) nature of art. Baker writes \"millenial dialogue\" so effortlessly that the characters' conversations don't even sound scripted. Not my favorite play by Baker, but still a good one.\n",
      "Review 4\n",

      "I recommend this book to people through my work all the time (Disclaimer: I work in the music business). When I was hired, my boss commanded me to read this book. It really is the definitive starting point for understanding how the music industry works. You can get the overview, or the advanced view, depending on how far you want to dive in. Passman has a good sense of humor, even about subjects that can cause musicians' eyes to start to glaze in many other industry guidebooks. Be on the lookout for the 7th edition, about to come out!\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "For school. Already had a copy from over ten years ago, but finally updated to the newest edition. Passman is great about including accurate and relevant information as the industry continues to change. Have heard this labeled \"the music business bible\" time and again, with due reason.\n",

      "I've been meaning to read this book for a while but wanted to wait until it had more current info on how artists were getting paid from streaming. Wow. There was so much information to digest about the different parts of the music industry. Learning how artists get screwed from publishing and label splits was eye-opening. You always hear about how terrible records deals are but damn. The book helped shed light and helped make me understand that you need leverage to get a fair shake in music. The book also showed me the various ways artist can and do make money in the music industry. One of my biggest takeaways from this book is that every musician should learn as much as they can about he industry as early as possible because learning a lot of lessons the easy way can set you up for a fruitful career.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is an amazing book for anybody that wants or needs to conduct any business within the music industry. In depth and up-to-date examples of record deals, publishing agreements, and licensing are conveyed with a funny and often sardonic flair.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've always heard there are two kinds of musicians: those who want a record deal, and those who want to get out of their record deal. My takeaway after reading? Stay independent and retain control over your own work.\n",

      "Truthfully, the title is a misnomer. It really should be \"All You Need to Know About the Bloodsucking Lawyers Within the Music Business.\" Because that's really what it is. It was written by a lawyer, and the lawyer side of things take predominance. Though that title wouldn't sell nearly as many copies.\n",
      "\n",
      "And since lawyers are basically America's version of The Mafia, knowing how to run through the loopholes is absolutely essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is designed for people who are already musicians with a budding music career. Those who have products to sell and at least some buyers interested in picking it up. If you want something a little more ground level, a little bit more about how to get things going from the start, then you'll need to look elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which, coincidentally, is what I'm trying to create right now. Considering I stumbled upon this book on my library's randomly recommended book list, it seems serendipitous that it'd recommend potential competitors to my start up.\n",
      "\n",
      "But enough about me. This is a well written, easy to understand book. I would 100% recommend it to anyone looking to sign a contract in the music world. This will help you keep your work yours. And most likely keep those billable hours down.\n",

      "What happens when you are deemed the Most Popular Girl in New York City strictly based upon your online dating profile? Only one person can tell us, and now she has.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t personally know a lot about online dating sites, but based purely on the number of commercials I see for them and the number of people I personally know who have used them, I know that they are a popular place to meet and get to know others that you wouldn’t have had the opportunity to meet otherwise. Doesn’t sound so bad. For one girl in particular, Lauren Urasek from NYC, online dating might not have led her to her soulmate yet, but it has led her to be recognized as the most popular girl in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "And thankfully, she wrote a book to tell us all about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lauren is a self-proclaimed “technology- and science-enthusiast-turned-makeup-artist” who unknowingly was making quite a mark on the online dating world with her own profile. She has since been highlighted on a plethora of sites anywhere from trusted big-time news sources to Buzzfeed and beyond. She’s experienced it all – accidentally becoming a sugar baby, guys who have absolutely no respect for her, and everything in between, she’s decided to share a few tips and experiences with us. Find out what red flags are worth ignoring, how to know whether someone is right for you, and even how to tell who is messaging you on the internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Useful? Useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lauren’s book, Popular, is multi-faceted. It’s part dating advice, part how-to-put-together-a-dating-profile, and part online dating horror stories. And even if you’re in a relationship already or aren’t interested in giving online dating a go yourself, the horror stories and “OMG DID HE REALLY SAY THAT” moments are by far enough to make this read worth it. I promise I’m not ruining anything by telling you that being the “Most popular girl in New York City” is not as luxurious as you might imagine, and even sounds fun at moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Popular is the perfect read for anyone who has dipped their toes into the online dating world, has had a bad relationship that ultimately turned out to be a great horror story, or (like me) you just have a weak spot for stories of dates-gone-wrong. Not to mention, who could resist this brightly colored cover?! It’s an easy to read book and totally fun that will have you both laughing and cringing with every turn of the page. If there’s anything I’m confident of, it’s that this book will leave you thankful that you’re not actually the most popular girl in NYC…even though the title does have a nice ring to it.\n",

      "I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT GENRE THIS BOOK FALLS UNDER, BUT WHATEVER GENRE IT IS, IS MY NEW FAVOURITE GENRE. LIKE I HAVE BEEN READING SO MANY BOOKS LIKE THIS THIS YEAR AND THEY ARE SO ENLIGHTENING AND I AM SO ADDICTED TO THEM. I CAN NEVER PUT THEM DOWN, THEY MAKE ME LAUGH, AND THEY GIVE SUCH GOOD ADVICE. THEY HELP ME LIVE MY LIFE AND MAKE ME FEEL LIKE IM NOT ALONE. MOST OF ALL, THEY GIVE ME HOPE THAT THE FUTURE WILL BE BRIGHTER. AS USUAL, I DONT KNOW WHY IM YELLING BUT IM JUST VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS BOOK. This book follows Lauren Urasek, who basically talks about relationships the entire book. She talks about the most talked about topic when it comes to dating in the 21st century- online dating. She talks about the perks, the negatives, and gives great advice. I really liked how she recounts all her stories with past dating experiences so that we realize we aren't the only cringe ones! She makes the guys we encounter seem okay! She tells hilarious stories that make me laugh super hard. I couldn't put it down, and I feel like I'm Lauren's friend now because relationships are usually something close friends talk about. She talked about relationships with all sorts of people she's dated- alcoholics, money-obsessed, mean people, emotionally detached, etc. She talks about how to deal with them, and realizing the fault is not yours. She talks about self confidence and self respect. I also liked how she had those red flag tips where she told us things about guys that are warning signs to look out for when talking to guys. They are 100% accurate, and I feel like this book would help a lot of young people who are new to dating because all the stuff she talks about is not something you can just search up, it's something you literally have to go through to understand. And above all, I love how she keeps such a humorous tone. I also liked how at the end of every chapter she had a segment of things that guys actually texted/said to her. They were so cringe and embarrassing, they will make you laugh and it's so relaxing!! I kept sending my friends pictures of things in the book because everyone should honestly read this book! This book also makes you think a lot, especially when she tells stories that remind you of other people.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I received this as a preview copy from the publisher. If I could give half ratings on Goodreads, I would set this as a solid 3.5 star review.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a tagline that reads, \"The Ups and Downs of Online Dating from the Most Popular Girl in New York City,\" I honestly expected a book full of essays that promised just that. Those stories from Lauren and from other contributors accounted for about half of the book. The rest of the book was filled with the do's and don'ts of online dating and brief reflections on the author's life over the last few years in NYC. I applaud the author for her honesty and candidness of her experiences and opinions. I found myself pulled in from the very beginning in which she describes the long-term relationship that she got out of that led her to online dating. I had a very similar experience and and found her easy to relate to.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the flip side, I found myself pulling away from her the further that I got into the book. It could be as simple as geographical differences (I do not live anywhere near a city the size of NYC or LA) or age, or experiences, but I found her advice a little naive and contradicting. She talks about the importance of looks then says it's superficial, and then decides right away on a person based on their looks. I understand the proverbial spark that everyone looks for, but sometimes it can take a few meetings to light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I would say that this was an enjoyable peek into someone's online dating experiences. I would definitely recommend this book to others - although, I think it is aimed more at the 18-25 year old market for sure. It was a fun read on a rainy afternoon.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I really wanted to like this book, but it’s just not good. It’s not so much about being named OKCupid’s most popular woman (her life after that happened is only briefly discussed), but rather some generic tips on online dating, very short stories from random contributors, and quotes from dating app messages. It’s pretty boring. There’s nothing exciting or interesting that happens. The whole book reads like the author is trying to justify her use of dating apps and humble-brag.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I read this book over two days during a really bad week, and it was exactly what I needed—funny, smart tales of bad dates from the woman New York Magazine dubbed “the most sought-after woman” in NYC in 2014. The book definitely made me cringe about a few internet dates from my past, but in the end, who doesn’t love to hear about all the stupid things guys say and do when dating (or trying to date) a woman?\n",

      "in the vivid and memorable opening scene of this novel, owen arthur bradshaw rescues a little girl from a potentially dangerous and decidedly undignified situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "but don't start organizing a parade for him just yet, because he is certainly no hero to little girls, especially when it comes to his daughter eeona, and his behavior towards her has looong term consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "this is a multigenerational historical/magical epic taking place in the virgin islands spanning from 1916 through to the 1970s. it follows the bradshaw family through their loves and losses, and the consequences of their family curse. it's all restraint, passion, family, fate, history, secrets, betrayal, and war, as these sprawling books tend to be. it is also a parallel history of the virgin islands, beginning with their transfer from danish to american rule, and the difficulties for those occupying this liminal space: to be a citizen of an owned territory so far removed from the controlling country, this ostensible, nominal belonging while not being truly equal, nor \"seen\" for what they are; an independent culture with independent values. a trinket in on the mantlepiece of america; a place to roll up on for the novelty of its beaches and local color, disrupting the serenity, putting up fences, and reducing the local people to an insulting backdrop (dear god, that ...)\n",
      "\n",
      "the story is told through the two bradshaw daughters, eeona and anette, and their half-brother jacob.\n",
      "\n",
      "eeona is a fascinating character. she is the devastating island beauty whose hubris is in believing too much in her own mythology and hype, denying herself romantic relationships, protecting others from her dangerous beauty, and scorning all the men who don't live up to her deceased daddy, becoming a cold woman. and, man, there is nothing more dramatic than how spectacularly a woman like this who has held herself back from love and indignity will eventually fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "eeona's got all kinds of secrets, both of her family's past and of the more... corporeal sort, and the keeping of these secrets while denying herself a fully-realized life is a lonely strain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "that passage broke my heart a little - a woman yearning for her childhood freedom and innocence, despite having had a childhood that is pretty horrifying to an outsider.\n",
      "\n",
      "her sister anette is the complete opposite. she is the embodiment of pure, unrestrained freedom, embracing the romantic possibilities, and ending up with three children by three different men.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "oh yeah, and she speaks in dialect instead of the self-consciously \"proper\" speech of her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "anette is a propulsive character - a force made up of impulse and energy, unapologetic, which is such a contrast to the her almost-ascetic sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "jacob's contribution to the narrative is primarily his perspective of the american experience - he leaves the islands to join the army and experiences all the racism and resentment of the american south in the 1940s.\n",
      "\n",
      "he contributes other things, but - spoilers.\n",
      "\n",
      "overall, it's a strong debut. while the overall \"story\" is a little disjoined and meandering, the characters alone are strong enough to hold the reader's attention, and the magical elements are nicely employed. read it for the descriptions and the characters - it is terrifically lovely.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Folks, I am going to do for you what I wish someone had done for me and warn that there is a very disturbing storyline in this novel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Early in the book it's revealed that there is a serious case of incest going on in the Bradshaw family. It is extra creepy because the daughter LOVE-LOVES her father, to the point where she wishes her mother would go away so she and her dad could be alone together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was disappointed because I had really been looking forward to this novel set in the Virgin Islands, and had even admired the writing. But the plot was so upsetting that I had to put the book down, and then dreaded coming back to it. In short, I was unable to finish this epic family saga.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am leaving it unrated because I can't quantify the Yuck factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good quote:\n",
      "\"At this moment it is only the one child and she is in love with her father. It is no large thing that this daughter will, in time, kill Owen Arthur. No large thing at all. Family will always kill you -- some bit by bit, others all at once. It is the love that does it.\"\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Some of my favorite books to find & look at on Goodreads are the divisive ones. Which I categorize as the ones that have an average rating that falls between 3.0-3.5. I call those books divisive because you'll look through some of the reviews accompanying them find readers who felt every which way about the book. You'll see folks DNF'ing it + giving it one star and you'll see those calling it one of their favorite books they've read during their given reading year. Sometimes even calling it a masterpiece.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to Land of Love and Drowning, Tiphanie Yanique's debut novel & winner of the one of my favorite prizes, The Center For Fiction First Novel Prize, in 2014, I fall on the side of positivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "LOLAD begins with Owen Arthur Bradshaw. He is married to the lovely Antoinette Bradshaw & they have two daughters together: The dangerously beautiful Eeona Bradshaw (who is the star of this novel), and the future historian, Anette Bradshaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Owen Arthur also has a son outside of his marriage, Jacob Esau McKenzie. His birth changes the course of these families lives forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "LOLAD is a multilayered novel that speaks to many themes. Among which are Freedom, and the specificity of this often generalized concept. How we think we envisioned our freedom perfectly until we receive it & realize it's wrong. It speaks to the concepts of love and belonging via dissections of healthy & unhealthy forms of both. It speaks to ownership. The rightful People owning their land & their country as opposed to the colonizers. Parents owning their children. Men owning women. People regaining ownership of themselves, which they should have never had taken from them. It is also a love letter to the Virgin Islands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously I recommend this book, but there is very sensitive & disturbing content/themes touched on/dissected (pedophilia, incest, etc.). LOLAD still is, however, a very rich and rewarding novel that I'm glad Yanique spent 11 years working on.\n",
      "\n",
      "If she spends 11 years per novel then we have 5 more years until her next one. I'm patiently waiting, but hoping it'll arrive sooner.\n",

      "I don't have much to say about this one. I didn't like it at all. The writing is good so a bumped it up a star but the storyline just didn't captivate me and the icky beginning just wouldn't go away. The two main characters, sisters, orphaned at a young age are shallow and vane and what emotions they do have are over the top and borderline crazy. Plus there is a lot of repetitiveness. Possibly a better review to come, but maybe not. Glad to be done with it.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is one of the most important books I've ever read. I was enlightened on the history of the US Virgin Islands in a unique and mind-bending way while being told an amazing story. The island culture is interwoven in this narrative rich in magical realism, social struggle, American history, and immense beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "These universal issues are dealt with in the story of two sisters who view the world through completely different eyes. Eeona, the eldest, is dangerously beautiful, damaged from an unhealthy relationship with her deceased father, and desperate to hold on to her high position in society following her parent's untimely deaths. Annette has a much different experience. She is years younger, barely remembers her parents, and only cares about living life to its fullest. She says and acts without thought of repercussions, and falls in and out of many relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You will experience wild swings of emotion with this book. I was forced to leave my American perceptions of certain subjects at the door and see it through the lens of a different culture. Infidelity, incest, and abortions are just the tip of the iceberg. While obviously a depressing subject matter, there is a non-judgmental and bizarre sense of logic in this writing. It sounds crazy and I'm not condoning any of the above, but reading this will shift some of the usual thought processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is discomfort in the way Americans gradually take over the beaches and island for tourism purposes and rum. It breaks your heart to see the discrimination you know is coming to people who are blindsided because the only exposure they have to American culture is the fun entertainment they see on TV. One of the characters unwittingly travels to America excitedly looking to sew costumes and design clothing only to find she is an unsuitable \"negro\" and then the Depression hits. As tragic as this is, you don't want to turn away. You want more stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book flows smoothly with many chapters from various perspectives. At times I had to take a few minutes in between to soak in all the information that had been thrown at me. This was a good thing, as it packed many punches for a 355 page novel.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took Yanique eleven years off and on to complete Land of Love and Drowning. It would take me at least that long to complete a worthy review, and will be much much longer before it's memory fades. Just go read it please. Even if you don't love it, at least you will have learned about a different culture and feel like a more well rounded person.\n",

      "I was sorting through some older books (the local library book sale is coming up) and came across Perkins’s “Paris” trilogy, which is one of the best YA rom-com series around. I definitely had to do a re-read, and the library can wait to get them for the next sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "This really is a trilogy, too, in that the story progresses from each volume to the next, with the principal characters becoming part of the supporting cast for each subsequent story. The first one features Anna Oliphant, seventeen and about to begin her junior year in Atlanta, when her divorced father announces she’s being packed off to a posh boarding school in Paris for her last two years. Dad is a very successful and wealthy author -- a beautifully satirical and spot-on portrait of Nicholas Sparks, actually -- and he wants her to experience “culture.” Anna resits, of course. She’s taken Spanish all through school and doesn’t know a word of French, she knows nothing about the city’s history, she won’t get to see her best friend, she won’t know anyone, and she’s sure she’ll be an outcast. (“No one will invite me to watch the mimes escape from their invisible boxes, or whatever.”) Plus, there was that boy she worked with at the theater with whom she’s sure things were just about to start happening.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it is, indeed, an alien environment, but then she’s taken under the wing of a group of students she meets her first night in the dining room. And the leader of the group is the extremely charismatic Etienne St. Clair, Anglo-American-French, and a history nerd. The others in the group are Meredith (tall, muscular, athletic, and a really nice person), Josh Wasserstrein (son of a U.S. Senator from New York, a very talented artist, and St. Clair’s best friend), and Rashmi Devi (Josh’s girlfriend, though they seem to fight a lot). Of course, there’s also Amanda, the requisite mean girl, who has her sights set on St. Clair and is jealous of his attentions to Amanda. At least Anna has her film review blog and her dreams of attending a university with a good from school and becoming the next Pauline Kael. It’s going to be a rocky couple of years for everyone, but Perkins is an expert and juggling all the plots, subplots, and relationships, and in building a very credible romance out of it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "* * * *\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The second volume is set in San Francisco the year following the first book and the focus this time is on Lola Nolan, seventeen, living in the Castro district with two gay fathers (one of whom is actually her biological uncle). She also has a twenty-two-year-old hard-rocker boyfriend, Max, whom both her dads hate. But the key to Lola is her love of costume. She dresses in bizarre ways but always seems to make it work, she has a serious talent with a sewing machine, and she hopes to become a costume designer in Hollywood and on Broadway. She’s also extremely independent-minded, which gets her into trouble on a regular basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Lola has a nemesis in Caliope Bell, a world-class figure skater her age who has lived next door off and since they both were small, and Caliope’s absurdly tall twin brother, Cricket. She had a huge crush on Cricket for years, but then Caliope basically chased her away, and then the twins moved to find her a new coach. Lola has been trying to get over Cricket ever since, and has sort of managed it, but now the twins are back again. She’s reconnecting with Cricket whether she wants to or not, Caliope is dedicated to sabotaging her, and Max is acting weird. The whole thing is causing her relationship with her overprotective dads to fray around the edges, and she’s feeling the pressure of trying to get her enormous Marie Antoinette gown completed before prom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, Perkins makes it all work and the supporting cast is equally well developed. Anna and St. Clair are college freshmen at Berkeley and San Francisco State and Lola is working part-time at the same theater where the work, so they're available to give her support and advice, and Lola’s best buddy, Lindsey, a buddy detective, is a hoot. (She should get her own book.)\n",
      "\n",
      "* * * *\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the third volume, we’re back in Paris, and this time we follow Josh the artist and his problems, as well as Isla Isla, a half-French fellow New Yorker who had a bit part in the first book. It’s the same year that Lola and Cricket are rediscovering each other, and Josh is a senior now. His girlfriend, Rashmi, dumped him (with justification) so now he’s spending all his time working on a massive graphic novel about his time at the school. And I mean all his time, because he’s not bothering much with actual school work, he hates his father (who’s using him as a photo op in his re-election campaign). Isla has been carrying a torch for Josh since they were freshmen, but this is the first time he hasn’t been surrounding by his crew (they’ve all graduated) and she wonders if perhaps she can work up the nerve to get to know him now. Isla’s very smart -- she’s set to be her class’s valedictorian -- but she’s also very shy and self-deprecating, so it’s a struggle. She also has a close friend in Kurt, whom she has known all her life and who is high-functioning autistic, but his particular take on on the world helps keep her grounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, Isla and Josh will slowly get together (or else there would be no story), but their relationship, too, will be exceedingly rocky as she tries to come to terms with his self-destructive side and with the stratospheric social world in which he moves because of his father’s career.\n",
      "\n",
      "As always Perks does a wonderful job of painting her characters and the turmoil of their lives in multiple dimensions. And the romantic scenes in all three books are beautifully done. I give all of them a very high recommendation.\n",

      "I LOVE ST CLAIR (Anna and the French kiss). Anna is not my fav Mc but she gets better as the first book progresses. In lola and the boy next door I was IN LOVE WITH LOLA. One of my favourite mcs ever. I thought she was such a unique character and that’s why I loved her. She made a lot of mistakes and had faults of her own but I think that improved her character a lot, showing that behind the costume she was just a normal girl. Cricket isn’t my fav love interest, I mean he’s ok but…. St Clair is superior in every single way possible (if only he was taller). I think Anna and the French kiss is a better book over all though. I am yet to read the 3rd book. This is such a good series despite the not so good names, really quick reads to get you out of a reading block.\n",

      "There’s nothing like a good YA suspense novel that keeps you up at night and results in you dropping your Nook on your face! (Yeah, that happened. It also hit my cat Shadow, who’d crawled up onto my chest to take a nap, but I digress.) I didn’t know how much I wanted this book until I started reading and took down somewhere between 250 and 300 pages of it in one night.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m going to have a lot to criticize this book about, but the point stands that Secrets, Lies, and Scandals really is an entertaining suspense novel. Lately, I’ve been so apathetic about reading that I can hardly work up the motivation to read before bed, let alone keep myself up to read more of and/or finish a book. This little novel made me do just that!\n",
      "\n",
      "While the characters are not the most fleshed out, the situation they find themselves in is so compelling that it makes up for lacking characterization. The strength of one element covering the weakness of another like this is, quite frankly, brilliant. Bestselling novels have pulled this trick too! Have you heard of The Lunar Chronicles by Marissa Meyer? Same deal: weak characters, strong worldbuilding and situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas, how compelling you find the characters’ situation may very depending on your opinion of Dr. Stratford, the sadistic college professor who ends up a dead man. He’s cartoonishly evil; he sends a student who arrived late on an fake errand so he can purposefully locks the guy out and he also fails another student just because someone stole her notes without her knowing so he could use them to cheat on the test.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I’ve had some evil professors. One ended every class with “now get out of here so you can smoke hash and talk bad about my country.” My mom had a teacher who told students on the first day to never comes to his office hours because a past affair he had with a student cost him his wife (in addition to the student, who’d only been doing him to get an A in the course). They were interesting!\n",
      "\n",
      "But Dr. Stratford? Nope. Not even a little interesting. He’s just evil and that makes his death inspire little emotion. When they’re trying to hide the death of a guy this awful, you may not be able to bring yourself to care about the teens’ efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secrets, Lies, and Scandals also indulges in some stereotypes that are pretty damaging for the groups involved: “bi people cheat on their spouses,” “mentally ill people are dangerous,” and “Asian people are emotionless.” All three ideas are played straight with no nuance, which isn’t what anyone wants when trying to find more diverse books and better representation of marginalized groups within literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the ending? UGH. Nearly killed the book for me. The entire book is about keeping Stratford’s death secret so our five main characters won’t end up in prison because Cade punched him, he tripped backwards over Kinley’s feet, and he hit his head on the way down. All five characters were witnesses and promise that if anyone tells, the other four will make sure the snitch takes the fall. As the investigation goes on, the characters go to different lengths to either hide what happened or come up with a “safe” way to tell the cops what went down.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it turns out to not even matter in the end thanks to a heavily contrived coincidence! All the time invested in the characters, all the time figuring out whose side you’re on and who you want to take the fall–because someone has to for the story to have weight to it–means nothing. The final chapter offers a twist that puts the characters in danger again, but it didn’t make me feel any less betrayed by how the novel let me down. Lord knows if there will be a sequel to follow up on that or if it will stay a standalone so readers can decide what’s next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would I read more thrillers from Morgan if she wrote them? Yeah, I would. I’d just want to know ahead of time if I should steel myself for stereotypes about POC, QUILTBAG, and mentally ill people. Thus my recommendation comes tentatively. Only read this if you can put the stereotypes out of mind and desperately need a suspenseful thriller to eat up your time.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Secrets, Lies and Scandals was a book I wanted to pick up because it reminded me a bit of The Secret History by Donna Tartt when I read the synopsis. Sadly, I wasn’t able to love that book so I was hoping I could read this one and enjoy it even more than that one! Unfortunately, that wasn’t to be… Although I did really like this book at the beginning, it fell kind of flat for me at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just want to clarify that although this book does share the same premise as The Secret History, it’s also noticeably different. For starters, it’s a YA book and that’s already a pretty big difference. As well as that, this one is a group of five students who aren’t friends being involved in a murder, instead of a number of friends who are. And I think it’s just that much harder to trust people who aren’t your friends to not turn you in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This book deals with multiple points of view – all five of the friends. I wasn’t too worried about this because you managed to get a good taste for each of the characters and the way in which they acted. I never felt a lack of depth due to the switching of points of views.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s Ivy, the popular girl who has fell from her pedestal. Mattie who is gay and has a long distance boyfriend he feels he can’t trust when he isn’t there. Kinley is a confident, goody-two-shoes with a big family reputation to live up to. Tyler is a juvenile delinquent and Cade is the rich kid.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All of them are very different and have different attitudes. But more importantly, each of them has a secret they are protecting or worried about protecting that is separate from the murder. I found those secrets to be incredibly interesting and I love how the author dragged out the suspense in those cases. And quite a lot of the discoveries were pretty scandalous, actually. And I was impressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The blame game going on, when they all agreed to keep the murder the secret but then were going crazy from paranoia was so interesting! It made things all the more suspenseful and the anticipation built as I wondered who would take the fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have to be honest. This book was building up to be a strong four stars, which was watered down to a three stars because of the flop of an ending. It’s not terrible, but for the level of suspense the book was arousing – it was pretty disappointing. I wish it could have ended in another way. What a shame >.>\n",

Secrets, Lies, and Scandals is similar to How to Get Away With Murder with a touch of Pretty Little Liars, so if you are a fan of the shows, then you should definitely give this a try. Any fans of mysteries, thrillers, and/or suspense would enjoy this read.\n",

      "This is a 230 page meditation on what Lolita was, where she came from and who got their hands on her after Vlad the Impaler had done with her. It's the perfect book to read after Lolita itself. Er, yes, it does have one of those really nasty sub-titles which every damned book appears to need these days. Being charitable, we will overlook that.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh how Lolita has been used and abused! First by cruel Humbert, next by creepy Quilty, and then by the critics and commentators who should know better. Jane Smiley has, like many others, also accepted that Lolita is a slut. After her stunning entrance in 1958 she very quickly became the poster girl for jailbait, or, in Lo’s own words, “fast little articles”. I was therefore very happy to see that Graham Vickers sees it as Job Number One to squash that lie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fact : she was 12 and at a summer camp she did, indeed, have sex with a boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fact : after that, Humbert abducted her for over a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fact : Humbert the nympholeptic tells us in the novel that SHE seduced HIM. This is clearly self-serving bullshit of the worst blame-the-victim type. And look, he has taken everyone in! Victims take note – no one will believe you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fact : as soon as she could organise a rescuer, she escaped his clutches. Alas for her, the rescuer was a perv called Clare Quilty who made porn films. He dumped her when she wouldn’t participate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fact : after a couple of years about which we know nothing, she got married to a deaf guy. Conclusion : not a slut. Lolita was not, in fact, a Lolita.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Vickers takes us through the twisty turny tale. Were there ur-Lolitas? Yes. Was the book a tough sell to publishers? – yes. It was first published by a classic French dirty books company, so that made everyone think it was high class porn. Graham Greene rscued it from oblivion, abetted by some frothing at the mouth tabloid editors. Finally it came out in Britain & the USA in 1958 and what happened – instant bestsellerdom and no prosecutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Vickers runs through the books before Lolita which contravened obscenity laws in the US, a motley crew – in the 20th Century there was Ulysses, Forever Amber, Memoirs of Hecate County by Edmund Wilson, the Kinsey Report, and Peyton Place. Lolita's was the storm that never arrived. No policeman got to finger her cute collar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it difficult to make into a movie? Oh yes – and Kubrick’s 1962 film sinks under its director’s self-imposed caution. There’s absolutely no sex in it. Anyone seeing it at the time having not read the book would think that Humbert merely liked pretty teenagers, and who doesn’t, so what’s the fuss all about? Lolita’s age is never mentioned in the entire film. GV hammers the movie, accusing it of (however understandable) spinelessness. Also – it was all filmed in England, which I didn’t know. Also – VN got an Oscar nomination for the script! I didn’t know that.\n",

      "The 1962 poster shamefully promoted the Lolita-as-Temptress canard. There’s little Lo sunbathing with her heart-shaped sunglasses and sucking a lascivious lollipop. Not only are those accoutrements not in the book, they aren’t in the movie either. But of course, it’s a brilliant image, which then got itself stuck onto the front of the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vickers runs through Hollywood’s flirtation with very young girls – Love in the Afternoon, Bonjour Tristesse, Baby Doll, Cape Fear, Gigi (“Maurice Chevalier, a musical Humbert if ever there was one, celebrated the unripe appeal of [the nymphet] with his lasciviously-delivered song thank Heaven for Little girls”), past Lolita to Candy (“supremely vulgar and jokily paedophilic”), Taxi Driver, Obsession (de Palma), and Pretty Baby (“it seems safe to say that such a movie might not be made today” – but available to all from LoveFilm/Netflix), taking in l’affaires de Polanski and Allen and hitting the buffers with a crash : Hard Candy, the anti-Lolita. (Not seen it? See it!) Then in the 50s came “one of the decade’s chief preoccupations, childish feminine innocence wrapped up in an adult body” – enter Monroe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we contemplate Lolita as Road Film, musing that Kerouac was typing at the same time as Nabokov was writing, from a different part of the literary universe, although Dean Moriarty considers the age of consent to be strictly for squares.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1990s Adrian Lyne, famous at that point for Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal and 9 ½ Weeks, began the hard slog of putting together a second Lolita movie. One’s heart may have sunk, considering his cv, but in 1998 it finally arrived, to general European acclaim and to American silence. It was good! It was faithful! GV notes that in the 35 years between the 2 movies, the attitude to paedophilia had sharpened to the point where the US movie industry itself censored the second Lolita – no distributor would touch it with a ten foot pole. Eventually it slunk out via cable & dvd.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also may note that there was an Alan Lerner/John Barry musical Lolita My Love which closed after 9 performances (in Boston) and lost $900,000. And an Edward Albee play which was hated by all. And in 1994 an opera performed in Swedish, also unsuccessful. There is a Japanese fashion mag called Lolita, and a punky version called Lolita Goth, or Loligoth. GV scratches his head over these. There are also many crimes to hit the press featuring underage girls, all of whom get called Lolitas if there’s any hint of complicity. And there is the internet and how that uses little Lo’s mellifluous moniker, of which the less said the better.\n",

      "The other two responses reflect the way you feel about the character, Lolita.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can see her as an innocent victim of a paedophile, and sympathise with her, so much so that you think her story should never have been told.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is a symptom of the premature sexualisation of children, and the whole issue of children’s sexuality and awareness of sexual behavior must be swept under the carpet, even in a novel intended for mature adults.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, while not approving Humbert Humbert in any way, you can treat her as a sexually precocious brat who deserves no sympathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those who have never read the novel, the last interpretation seems to be the one that prevails.\n",
      "\n",
      "The very word “Lolita” has become shorthand for adolescent girls who “prey” on men’s libidos, as if the men are somehow innocent and vulnerable and not in control of their sexuality.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It wasn’t my fault, she made me do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She’s jailbait of the most cynical and calculating kind.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Part of Nabokov’s genius is that “Lolita” is actually Humbert’s story, and he tells it his way.\n",

      "The Lolita that we get to know is his creation, although in reality both Humbert and Lolita are obviously Nabokov’s creations.\n",

      "It’s as if Lolita had to fall, had to suffer, so that others might be saved. She is a lost cause, better focus on the plight of others. We can talk her down, as if she were a real tart, and we can use her name to demonize others. It’s OK, she’s only a fictional character anyway, as if real girls aren’t hurt, when they in turn get labeled “Lolita”.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I don’t condone the sexual abuse of children, I feel quite strongly that other aspects of premature sexualisation are equally deserving of condemnation, e.g., placing three and four year old girls in beauty pageants and grooming them for a lifetime of the presentation of self as an object of beauty, rather than as a fully-rounded person of intelligence, social functionality, energy and charm.\n",

      "This social definition of beauty and sexual attraction is what really interests me about the novel.\n",

      "I won't argue that I've been obsessed with the novel Lolita as of late, then again I did go to the trouble to write up four essays about the novel as well as the film, and this book is just a continuation of my intellectual exploration of the novel. Something's that's always bothered me about the discussions which surround the book the sexual treatment of Dolores Haze, Lolita's real name, is that there appears to be some kind of strange combination of victim blaming mixed with a fetishization of the figure of the little girl. Since it's publication Lolita has become synonymous, if not the defining image of pedophilia in our culture, and so rather than having a real discussion about the novel many are quick to dismiss the text as a purely dirty book and then not go any further.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vicker's book is a response to this impulse, as well as the impulse to eroticize and fetishize Dolores Haze into some kind of sex symbol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vickers explores the original novel by Nabakov while also trying to understand how, despite the author's best efforts, the name and figure of Lolita has become a kind of gross sex-symbol. Whether it's looking at the various Lolita fashions, the two movies, and the proliferation of the use of the word of Lolita in our culture Vicker's book is an attempt to understand this phenomena. It's also his effort to try and divorce Delores Haze from this mass rhetoric which had steadily left her suffering either absent to ignored. There are some problems with Vickers book because his prose is not everything I would want it to be, and at times his analysis is not as in-depth I would have lied it. There are numerous passages where he seems to are throwing out cultural examples of the \"Lolita-effect\" simply to shock or titillate his reader. Yes despite these shortcomings this book is a solid example of cultural research because upon finishing the book I considered Delores Haze once agin. I considered whether I paid enough attention to her and her struggles in the novel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lolita is a complicated book, not just because of the emotions it inspires, but because of the complexity of the character of the young woman who's voice is robbed from the reader. Humbert Humbert has had chance after chance to seduce his reader onto his side, yet for all his poetics Delores Haze shines through and elicits our concern and pity. And yet, as Vickers's book demonstrates, there are also far too many readers who have been seduced by Humbert and thus have turned Lolita into a sex symbol she was never supposed to be.\n",

      "This is required reading for anyone interested in Nabakov's beautiful novel.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I was really looking forward to reading this book because of the subject matter that claims to be addressed in the subtitle: \" How Popular Culture Corrupted\" Lolita. It's been a topic I've been interested in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, rather than providing any sort of thoughtful theories on the topic, the author just proceeds to provide us with a huge and tangential list of any movie, book, or famous person that is somehow associated with pedophilia. How most of these relate back to the topic at hand, I still have no idea. And why providing excruciatingly detailed the synopses of every movie in a director's repertoire— or the life stories of said famous people— or the authors critical analysis of all of their works— adds any insight to the topic: I don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book could have used some serious editing to keep it relevant. Unfortunately, if it were edited down to the relevant text, it would be about thirty pages. And it still wouldn't provide much insight at all.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Wow! A fascinating read about the history of Lolita in popular culture. The writing is gorgeous, and the pace was fast enough that I stayed interested, even though I usually read fiction. There were a few parts of the book that I disagreed with, such as when the author seemed upset that the child pornography act of 1996 was a nuisance because it delayed the release of the 1997 film version of Lolita. My opinion is that any anti-child pornography act is a good thing, and I can't really say that Lolita ever should have been made into a movie.\n",

      "This game puts role-playing and magic on an entirely new scale - there is no attempt to make magic \"balanced.\" In most games, magic is pretty much the equivilant of fighting, only more etherial; magicians are more like archers than warriors, and they have enough cons to balance out the pros of being a magic-user. In Ars Magica, magic is powerful, arcane, and shakes the foundations of reality. Magic users are aloof, distanc, powerful, and controlling - they are not the spell-user of D&D, but Gandolf or Merlin, the magicians you think of when you think of fantasy. Interesting rules involving thanes and followers, setting up a castle and running entire communities based around your character.\n",

      "At some point in the early days of the pandemic, I had the urge to read this book. It had been sitting there, in the shelf of the FNGS around the corner for the three and a half years I have been living in this flat. I got it the second day the store opened…and it lasted me until today. Yes, in the meantime, I have read many other things, but there is no way of denying this is not the lightest RPG around. It might be its fifth edition, but it feels old, very rules heavy, and so rich on arithmetic you might as well have a spreadsheet rather than a character sheet.\n",
      "Without trying to offend anyone, this feels pretty much like D&D’s Player’s Handbook: lots of rules, and not that much background. Mind you, what little is there, is pretty cool, but I feel I need to and buy a couple more books to know what Mythic Europe is really about. I am still undecided in that matter.\n",
      "I do not know how much of Rein-Hagen is still in this game, but in many ways, if feels a lot like Vampire: character as opposed to plot driven, lots of books expanding the setting, and not much in the way of a “regular campaign/scenario”. I still think The Masquerade had more setting information it its core book than this volume. That said, one thing Ars Magica has over its Kindred counterpart, is the Troupe-style gaming. I had read about it, and the truth is that it only covers about two pages of the whole book, but it is a great idea, and one that could also work very well in VtM.\n",
      "If one of the reasons I got this book was to—unsuccessfully—build beautiful stories in my head while reading the game, the other was the magic system. The idea that you have a Technique—the action—and a Form—the object of such action—is full of potential, as clearly shown in the rules. I do not think is necessarily more flexible than any of the Mage games though.\n",
      "It was certainly not the game I anticipated. I am quite happy with Old School games, but this is just too much for me right now. Not to bring it closer to home, but “Aquelarre”—now available in English—might be overall a much better game, despite it is more limited geographical scope.\n",

      "What it says on the tin: this is the story of a young woman who ran away from her life, and created a new one wearing trousers. Her life as a girl was intolerable, so she reinvented herself as a man, and when the Civil War came along she, or rather he, enlisted in a spirit of determined patriotism, and became the best soldier in his unit – and a nurse, devoted to his patients, and postmaster (which I never really realized was so dangerous) and attaché and Union spy. And in two years of service to the Union (almost) no one ever even suspected Frank Thompson was actually a girl named Sarah.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure what this book is, exactly. (Besides received from Netgalley - thank you to them and the publisher.) It's based on historic fact, which could make it historical fiction. Moreover, it's based on the life of a real individual, so maybe it could be called a fictional biography – but no, it's in the first person, so maybe a fictional memoir. Except that the individual in question, a woman named Sarah Emma Edmonds, wrote a memoir of her own in 1864, so it's a little odd to have a novelized version.\n",
      "\n",
      "I read this with the understanding that it based on a true story, and the notes following the book emphasize this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(The numbers I've seen regarding women who served in the Civil War in disguise actually range from something like 250 to 700, so four hundred is a happy median.)\n",
      "\n",
      "But immediately after stressing the truth of the story, the author reveals that a major event at the end of the book was a complete fabrication, almost exactly the opposite of what really happened. The end of the story is not how the story ended. So, while \"the bones of the story are all true\", this event at the end \"seemed like something that should have happened, and the advantage of fiction is that you can choose the shape of the story\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, but – this isn't fiction. Not really. It's fiction. And I have a problem with the change that was made. Problems. For one, I don't see making a change this big at the end of the story of a woman few have heard of as any more acceptable than, say, changing the end of a certain evening in April 1864 to have John Wilkes Booth miss his shot, or than saying that eventually Thomas Jefferson freed and married Sally Hemings. Or to have Henry VIII say \"You know, that Catherine is actually rather nice. I believe I'll go back to her and be a good husband.\" If a writer takes on the task of writing about a life, about an individual's existence, to make a change just because it feels like what happened is, in my opinion, intellectually dishonest. It breaks faith with the subject of the writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other side of it is that now I have doubts about everything else in the book. There are some highly improbable events in the story, and the story as a whole is improbable, and I went along with all of it because, I was assured, it was all based on history. But. If that last really quite large happening never happened, I'm inclined to doubt the rest, however much the author assures me it's faithful. There was so much luck running through it – sheer dumb luck that kept Sarah/Frank from major injury in battle, not to mention from discovery – that it became a little hard to swallow; s/he glided through the War like the Maryest of Sues, able to do absolutely anything they set her to: she was a crack shot, a born rider, a gentle and patient nurse with an iron nerve, a natural spy, a daring messenger, and no more concerned about killing the enemy than the next man. So to speak. Very shortly she had everyone thinking Frank was the best fellow ever, and in the two years she fought only completely coverable glitches occurred, and – as I said, almost no one ever even entertaining a suspicion that Frank wasn't what he seemed to be in two years of sleeping and eating and everything else in close quarters with no real privacy. Only the \"but she really existed!\" thing kept me going. Once there was a hole knocked in that, all bets were off.\n",

      "The point is played up that all the names in the book are true to life, that Sarah Emma Edmonds/Frank Thompson did indeed serve in the same unit with Damon Stewart (hmm) and Jerome Robbins (!) and so on. But I wish the real names had not been used. I feel like this would have been a more honest novel – more honest as a novel – if the heroine had been named Jane Doe calling herself Joe Schmoe, and bunked with a lad named John Doe and fell in love with Richard Roe. Or something. My understanding is that Sarah's experience served as the backbone of the book, and the plot was filled in with bits and pieces and shreds and patches from other tales of others of the four hundred women. If this had been straightforwardly presented as a composite portrait, leaning heavily on Sarah but not trying to revivify Sarah, I feel it would have been a much better book – a cleaner book, in a way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to keep it honest would have been to simply tell Sarah's story without messing about with facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can't have it both ways. You can't preen about how factual the story is and then say \"well except for this bit here which I just didn't like the historical reality of\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, and this is purely a personal reaction, I find it very sad that Frank's way of proving his masculinity was to tell dirty stories and spit and scratch and fart.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is the story of Sarah Emma Edmonds, who masqueraded as a man named Frank Thompson during the Civil War. Among her many adventures, she was a nurse on the battlefield and a spy for the Union Army, and was captured by (and escaped from) the Confederates. The novel is narrated by Sarah, offering readers an in-depth look not only at the Civil War but also at her journey to self-discovery as she grapples with living a lie and falling in love with one of her fellow soldiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book intrigued me with the story of a real woman who fought in the Civil War. I have to say I was impressed by the level of dedication the author put into telling as close a rendition of Sarah's real story as it really happened, choosing to only describe the battles in which she or her unit were involved in. This made the story seem more realistic and really kept me interested in Sarah's story. Although the author does admit that some parts of her story are changed ever so slightly from what actually happened (won't tell you what you have to read it to find out), much of the descriptions, journal entries and much of the 'plot' (you have to remember this was a real war) actually come from the diaries of the soldiers in Sarah's regiment. This brings an unvarnished feel to the writing style, not bothering to cover up or romanticize just how gruesome this war really was. Overall, I would call this one of the best written, closest to the truth historical fiction novels I have ever read.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The book started out well, and after a few chapters I felt it going downhill. The story kept changing, and when it wasn't changing it was repetetive. Alot of the descriptions were a waist of time and I just skipped passages at a time (Something I never do).\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I've always been fascinated by the American Civil War era and I love historical fiction, so of course I was drawn to this title. However, it wasn't what I was hoping for. While the real-life narrator is a fascinating subject, the way the book was written just didn't work for me. A lot of the book is spent in Sarah's head as she struggles to figure out who she is. That's completely understandable, and fine up to a point. But eventually, it got repetitive. Then when there was action, there was real, gritty action - too gruesome for my tastes. My favorite parts were definitely the spying bits. Those were pretty interesting, though it felt like some of them could have been fleshed out more, had less time been spent on the other stuff. I stuck with it because I wanted to see how Sarah's story turned out in the end. I guess I was mostly satisfied, though it felt a bit depressing.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I suppose, if I knew nothing about Sarah Emma Edmonds/Frank Thompson, if I knew nothing of women who disguised themselves to fight in the Civil War, if I enjoyed sappy romances....I might have enjoyed the story. But I didn't. Because Sarah Emma Edmonds/Frank Thompson was one of my heroines growing up. I read fictitious stories, biographies, any story I could get my hands on about her or the females who disguised themselves to fight. And so while I picked this book up with deep interest, I should have realized that my experience in the subject would be somewhat alienating. Though I am no where near as much an expert on her as I am on Mary, Queen of the Scots or the Lincoln assassination, I have a general knowledge that was slightly skeptical of this story.\n",
      "On top of just little things, like the creative license taken with Sarah, three things specifically bothered me.\n",
      "1. The writing. The first person style worked...to a point. It was rather limiting, though. Confusing. It's not quite a memoir, yet full of 'flash backs' so that it's hard to pin it down. Cluttered at times. I didn't really like it.\n",
      "2. This was the real big one...the romance. There isn't much of an actual here, as much as a girl disguising herself as a boy and getting all sappy over a soldier. A soldier who can never love her....just all confusing and weird.\n",
      "True love isn't all about the emotional hype, and that's all there is here. Butterflies and un-returned longing and....yeah. It got old because the story could have been . It could have reflected an independent young woman fighting for her country and being creative and courageous. Instead, we mostly get her mooning over a guy.\n",
      "3. The modern mindset was also glaringly distracting. This is a personal pet peeve. Sarah has nothing good to say about being female. She's all about independence, being her own person...all good things! Yet I cannot help but be skeptical of how much our 'modern' mindset on femininity would have entered her thoughts. Distracting at best, downright irritating at worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "So....there is a better retelling out there. I mean, it wasn't a bad story. Probably someone else's cup of tea. Just not my idea of good historical fiction\n",

      "a shorter review than the book probably deserves, but honestly I was underwhelmed by this Martin Walker historical thriller. I'm not exactly sure what turned me off, because the three interlocking stories that form the novel aren't exactly bad and I was actually traveling through the region, sampling foie-gras and confit de canard as I was reading, visiting Lascaux and most of the other villages mentioned in the story. Maybe it was the heavy political slant of the middle section, the one dealing with the Nazis but focusing mostly on the BAD Communist maquis. Maybe it was the cardboard characters and the wooden dialogue in the modern section, the one investigating a 'lost' cave with prehistoric murals. The result was that I actually looked forward only to one third of the book, the one actually describing the lifestyle of the cavemen 20000 years ago and speculating what made them do grandiose animal frescoes nobody could see clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having grumbled away at what the novel failed to deliver on my expectations, I would mention that I am still interested in what Walker has done with his police procedural series (\"Bruno, Chief of Police\") because he clearly is interested in the Perigord region and has a keen eye for detail.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Written before the excellent Inspector Bruno series, this novel has three braided stories, all set in the caves area of Perigord, but one set 17000 years ago, one in the present and one in 1944 as the Resistance stepped up its campaign against Nazi occupation.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "The only problem that I had with this book, and it turned out to be a major one with me, is that it contains 3 different stories. I'm used to reading books with different threads, that jump back and forth from one time or situation to the next, but this one made me feel that I was actually reading 3 different books at one time which I don't do. I need to concentrate on one book at a time. I found the two threads concerning the modern day theft of the cave art piece and the prehistoric society responsible for that art very interesting. At first, I thought that the 1944 French Resistance story would reveal the reason for the intrigue surrounding the art theft sooner than it did. I began to get bored with that story because it was difficult for me to keep the multitude of characters straight in my head while switching back and forth between the 3 stories page by page, and I'm not a big fan of reading about warfare. The ending tied the Resistance story to the modern day theft...it just wasn't a completely enjoyable journey for me.\n",

      "This is a magnificent, rich novel involving human triumph at its best (through love, leadership and enduring art) and its worst (through war and the struggle for exclusive possession).\n",
      "\n",
      "The novel cycles through the viewpoints of prehistory (15000 BC), the French Resistance (in 1944) and the present. Each of these timeframes has its own triumphs, tragedies and mysteries. There is at least one common thread throughout these different stories, and a sense that some aspects of humanity are timeless. This is a beautifully written novel: one to be savoured.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Started out gripping. Halfway through I had become bored with details of the 1944 thread. Still can't figure out why the author tells the story of the WW II strand first through the modern day research story and then recounts it again in the 1944 story. It would have been much more gripping to have it unfold through the characters of 1944 first. The end of the book was so abrupt and unsatisfying, I was quite disappointed. This had the potential,of being so much more.\n",

      "This was a book that I won from a Goodreads giveaway. I had tried to win it a few times, actually, because the premise really interested me. What better subject is there than Facebook to entice today's reader?\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I'm not even sure where to begin. There were so many different tales woven into one here, and unfortunately, I don't mean that in a good way.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, it appeared to be a story about a girlfriend murdering her significant other. Then it became about incest (EW - thank you, NO). Follow that up with a little volcano-chasing. What do you get? A whole mish-mash of...'stuff'. That's precisely what I found here. I think the author could've had a great story -several, in fact. But, I don't think they all necessarily belonged together. Instead of being one cohesive piece, it felt like I was reading several different stories that were pasted together. In one chapter,I'd be on the edge of my seat, eager to see what the next page held. Conversely, in the next chapter, I'd be snoring - reading the same sentence over and over again and still not comprehending its meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "One last thing - the poor editing had me going batty by the time I reached the end. The whole \"your vs. you're\" and \"its vs. it's\" thing just gets under my skin.\n",

      "This book ($4.99 for Kindle) is impossible to classify. Yes, a bit of facebook (and correct even!) A bit of murder (one of the main characters is dead by the second page & still narrates). More than a bit of new ageism. A bit of love and a bit of hate. A lot of Hawaii. Very very different... and if you hang in there during this unusual book until about 2/3 of the way through you are treated with an exciting, tense extremely well written part of folks dealing with a natural disaster.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Based on the title, Death by Facebook, I envisioned something about...well, death by Facebook. Someone wasting away, starving to death, because they couldn't get off Facebook, or maybe a Facebook killer. Facebook is mentioned in the first few pages...and then never again. Death by Facebook is a very poorly chosen title for this book, and made me, as a reader, feel like I'd been misled.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as the story itself, I found it rather choppy. Numerous characters that all seemed to be unrelated, as though I was reading several different books at once. Some characters were introduced and then abandoned (Jimmy's mother and her boyfriend/friend, for example), and their roles seemed to be ones that should be there. Jimmy's mother, for example, didn't seem to serve any real purpose except maybe as proof that he had a mother, and her behavior never really seemed to fit with how she should be behaving in the given circumstances. She should have been more developed, with her learning what happened, her reaction to it, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other characters did seem to be more central to the story, but they weren't developed all that well. Many of them seemed rather flat and one-dimensional.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there were a few characters that seemed completely pointless. Wally's son, the headlamp guys, and at least one of the front desk clerks come to mind for this. They seemed to have no purpose other than just as filler - as though the author had set a number of characters that needed to be in the book, and had empty spaces to fill.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were glimmers of a good story here and there, so I believe the author is probably pretty good in general, but this book is not a shining example of his work.\n",

      "I'm required by the terms and conditions of the Goodreads book giveaway in which I won this novel to state in the review that that is how I acquired my copy of this book.\n",

      "This want a bad book at all. I read it in 24 hours if that tells you anything. Very islandish. Maybe a little too new age for me, but then again I don't run on island time myself so i'm biased there.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is in fact less about Facebook than you would think from the cover and the title. More about . . . I don't know . . . the interconnectedness of all life, nature, and the universe? Maybe Facebook is a good modern day representation of how interconnected we all are now that I think about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend this book to a certain group of friends, it's definitely not for everyone.\n",

      "I loved this book. The stories are marvelous. They’re exceptional. They’re incredibly deftly written. Each story is a gem, as is the entire narrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though I thoroughly enjoyed the book, it wasn’t a comfort read for me. In fact, all my hypochondriac tendencies and fears about my future health status were activated, but I loved the stories anyway, despite feeling sad, infuriated, and especially really scared at times while reading. It greatly helped that the compassionate nature of the writer continually shines through the pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven’t enjoyed a short story book as much since I read by . Although I’ve always enjoyed reading essays, but my usual preference is to read novels and full-length non-fiction books rather than short stories and books of short stories. However, these are intersecting stories, with characters that sometimes make appearances in different stories. The stories also somehow feel as if they’re part of one story, and in general they do follow a timeline, from young to old, from students to experienced medical doctors. The whole thing worked really well. I thought the stories fit together so well even before I got to the last story, and that last story solidified the job of tying all the stories together.\n",
      "\n",
      "These stories are published as fiction but all along they read as truth to me, and the last story makes clear that each does have a huge non-fiction component. That’s why this book is on so many of my apparently contradictory shelves.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the quote that starts the book: “If you don’t care for obscenity, you don’t care for the truth.” (It’s by Tim O’Brien from How to Tell a War Story. I can’t find that book at Goodreads but I probably wouldn’t add it to my favorite quotes anyway, even though I really like the quote and it definitely fits this book.) One of my big quibbles with medicine, ever since I was aware, from eleven years old on, is the dishonestly. When it comes to medical matters I value honesty above all else. (I recently took a continuing education class about end of life care and was tempted to write a long rant in the feedback section to their contention that what is most important when treating a patient is hope. Not for myself it isn’t; it’s honesty.) I appreciate that she has worked in palliative care.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved the San Francisco settings. I could identify most of them and am familiar with some of them. I always enjoy books that I can put on my san-francisco shelf. This book makes wonderful use of the city, its medical facilities but also many other places.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really appreciated how skillfully the relationships and communications and miscommunications were explored, from cross-cultural, to supervisor-supervisee, doctor-patient, between lovers and between friends, between group members, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I read these stories I couldn’t help but be aware of the following of my feelings/beliefs: Don't get sick. Don't get disabled. Don't get old if not in perfect health, and be wealthy, not poor. And perhaps: Don’t go into medicine, or be careful it’s your true calling if you do. I have physicians in my family and I’ve watched many in the process of dying, so I’d already thought a great deal about these matters, but reading this book has caused enough of a shift that I think I’ll be looking at death & dying and doctor-patient relationships slightly differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m always impressed by and frequently enjoy writing by physicians. On the back inside cover of the book, in the bio section, it says that “She is an associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, where she cares for older patients and directs the Northern California Geriatric Education Center and UCSF Medical Humanities.” She probably couldn’t have written this exact book without her medical training and practice, but it reads as a book written by a true writer, and I hope she writes and publishes more work. I’ll read it if she does.\n",

      "Louise Aronson has an MFA from Warren Wilson College and an MD from Harvard. She has received the Sonora Review prize, the New Millennium short fiction award, and three Pushcart nominations. Her fiction has appeared in Bellevue Literary Review and the Literary Review, among other publications. She is an associate professor of medicine at UCSF, where she cares for older patients and directs the Northern California Geriatrics Education Center and UCSF Medical Humanities. She lives in San Francisco.\n",

      "i am feeling professionally inadequate! :)\n",
      "\n",
      "this book really resonated with me -- though i found it hard at moments to separate the fiction from the fact - wondering often what was real and what was made-up? the style of the telling very much lends itself to just hearing a doctor speak about cases/people she has known.\n",
      "\n",
      "this collection of short stories is really wonderful. Aronson writes in a way that complex emotions and ideas are addressed via memorable characters and tight prose.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "\"History of the Present Illness\" is a superb story collection. This is not the standard medical memoir: \"here's what happened to me in the ER today.\" No, this is spell-binding fiction a la John Cheever or Alice Munroe. The stories are surprising, eclectic, engaging, and edifying. The characters are fully drawn and so alive on the page. There is not another book like this in the literary medical world. Once you start it, you will not put it down. Easily once of the best books I've read in a long time.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Aronson is an MD who completed the strenuous Warren Wilson part-time MFA program; she is a close observer of the human condition, empathetic without drama, perceptive to an almost painful degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the stories in this collection (her first publication) grow out of the experiences of patients, families of patients, medical caregivers and their families. Others have done this -- and done it well -- but Aronson's work stands out specifically for the insight into the lives of women who take up medicine. Even when the main character is male, there is a female psychiatrist not very far in the background who is the lynchpin in his story (\"Giving Good Death,\"). I especially liked \"Blurred Boundary Disorder,\" which takes the form of a frenzied, footnote-riddled letter to a female physician's superiors. She is determined to change her own history, and to do so by forcing new terms for her own symptoms into the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy. It is a challenging story to read, but it may also the most interesting picture I have ever had of the inner workings of a psychiatrist's mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aronson is full of compassion and at the same time, she dissects with ruthless efficiency. Her skill is in isolating the clearest, most revealing details and serving them up without sugar-coating. I have rated this four stars out of five, simply because collections of short stories are much harder to pull off, and there are a few uneven entries.\n",

      "I’ve got a couple of friends who are nurses and doctors. Two have them have worked in the emergency department of a major city hospital in Melbourne. They have the BEST dinner party stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if Louise Aronson, a doctor and an author, wrote A History of the Present Illness at the prompting of her friends? Maybe not – her collection of interlinked short stories are a brilliant mix of the delicate, hard-hitting, personal and coolly remote – not dinner party conversation fodder at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the recent, terrible event in Sandy Hook in the US, Obama’s reforms to the American health system were filtering through to the news broadcast in Australia. Gun control may take over policy debate within the forseeable future however the issues in the existing healthcare system will still be festering away. When I look at pop-culture takes on the US healthcare system that have influenced (and to a certain extent informed) me over the past decade it comes down to three things – Mike Moore’s documentary, Sicko; Lionel Schriver’s novel, So Much For That (and an accompanying author talk that I attended); and my guilty television pleasure, Grey’s Anatomy. So I’m hardly qualified for judging whether Aronson’s collection of stories are a fair reflection of US healthcare. Instead, I put judgement aside and enjoyed each story for what it was – a heartfelt snapshot of men, women and children in the neighborhoods, hospitals and nursing homes of San Francisco.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the sixteen stories are little lessons in compassion with Aronson swinging the reader from the perspective of doctor, to patient, to on-looking family member. Some stories are told in the first person, others in the third. Some are lush, detailed and sentimental whilst others are stark, clinical. Despite the obvious changes in creative writing style between the stories, there are subtle links between each and the overall result is impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are no weak spots in this collection. From the first story, a man talking about his day-in-day-out visits with his wife who is in a nursing home after suffering a stroke -\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s much like caring for a baby, he explains to his daughter, except without the sweet smells, without the hope.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“The nursing notes in his chart said that Jake’s family never visited… It was impossible to look at Jake’s torso and not think plague and curse and infestation and death. But it was equally impossible to imagine how people could stop seeing, touching, and loving their son.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I started the last story in the collection not realising that it is the author’s story. It offers some nice insights into her work as both a doctor and as an author and how each role informs the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In medicine, the ‘history of the present illness’, or HPI, is the critical first portion of the medical note that describes the onset, duration, character, context, and severity of the illness. Basically, it’s the story, and without it, you can’t understand what’s going on with your patient.”\n",

      "This fourth book in the series definitely takes a turn for the more serious. Not only in terms of the issues between the main characters, but also in terms of the external problems they have to face, and the overarching story. Where the enemies have been more or less in hiding before, with only an odd appearance and mention here or there, they come out into the open in this book. The result is mayhem and destruction, as well as some pulling together of old friends for mutual support.\n",

He has also been looking for his mates forever, but when he finds them, it is in the middle of one of them in crisis, and the villains closing in. It takes a while for Brio to adjust, and nothing quite goes how he expects, but he is determined to make the relationship with the O'Hagan twins work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finn and Ferguson are very close, and when Ferguson jumps to help defend their mother against an unexpected demon attack, it has disastrous consequences. Ferguson fears Brio won’t want him now, and tries to withdraw. Of course, Finn will have none of that, and neither will anyone else of their friends, but Ferguson has a very hard time dealing with his new reality. I loved how Finn never let him retreat into his shell.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a book about dealing with a disfiguring injury, and the support you can get from lovers and friends – if you let them! If you like stories about men dealing with loss and hardship, if you enjoy flawed characters struggling with a new reality, and if you're looking for some very hot between-the-sheets action, you will probably like this book.\n",

      "Let me start by saying that I have already read the majority of the books in this series and was following it for a long time. I lost track of it and realized recently that I had about 4 new books in the Marius World Series to read. But it has been a long time since I read some of them, and I couldn't really remember much of the overarching plot. I also hadn't read much of the \"Beyond the Marius Brothers\" stories and never even added the ones I read onto Goodreads.\n",
      "I decided to take up the challenge of re-reading all the books (21 so far) in this series chronologically and writing a few thoughts on each. So I will set new dates to the \"read date\" section as I go along.\n",

      "I really enjoyed reading this book. It had something I felt was missing in most of the books. A build up of a loving relationship. I felt the growth of Brio`s love for his mates and Finn`s and Fergus`s love for Brio too. i thought Brio handled Fergus`s arm missing and the subsequent problems really really well. I mean he was pretty fantastic. So yeah, I though Joyee Flynn did a fabulous job with this book.\n",

      "C'est vraiment de la merde.... Je suis hallucinée qu'on publie ce genre d'histoire à la con. Comment peux-tu expliquer pendant que l'autre est entrain de crever, les 2 autres baisent, eh bien en disant qu'ils étaient en plein break-down, il faut avoir sacrément snife pour sortir de pareilles merdes. Sans oublier grâce littéralement à la queue magique, tout est arrangé et va pour le mieux. Sans déconner... perdre un membre de ton corps n’est pas à prendre à la légère (souffrance physique et psychologique due à cette perte), alors pourquoi traiter le sujet avec une telle légèreté... ah oui je sais, l’auteur de cette histoire est médiocre et sans talent.\n",

      "I have such mixed feelings about this book. It was good to get to know more of the Coleman family from More Than You Know. The setting on the Cape is always appealing. The story was fine, not great but not bothersome either. The bad: There were at least eleven significant characters most with biblical names so I was frequently confused. It didn't help that in one paragraph Asa got out of bed, Noah left the bedroom, and Asa went downstairs. I'm guessing that was an editing issue! My second problem was with the sledgehammer use of religion. I attend church regularly and think the sermons I hear are more subtle than the conversations this family has!\n",

      "Under a Summer Sky by Nan Rossiter. Life comes full circle and as the Prologue begins and the Epilogue closes a lifetime passes. Life is precious and we don’t know how long we have. Instead of wishing away the meaningless days, the characters learn to embrace them. Rossiter’s books are like being welcomed into a family and as the novels progress you begin to care about the characters. Readers cheer during the memorable moments and tear up when heartbreak threatens to destroy their close-knit families. Love, forgiveness and heavenly guidance center the Noah and Laney’s marriage and with faith, they can get through anything.\n",

      "I'm going to go against popular opinion and state that this wasn't a very good book. Sure, there were a few good life lessons included in its pages. However, the writing was mediocre and the story telling was terrible. The characters were unbelievable, both in dialogue and action. I was surprised that the characters didn't punch Jones for delivering these messages that go against the grain of their lives. While the messages were good ones, it was unbelievable that people would accept these messages right off the bat. No real contemplation, no real struggles, just quick acceptance of an old man's \"noticing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I have to disagree with a couple of the lessons. Jones states that if you want people to like you, think about what it is that they would change about you. Some of the things I agree with, like reducing or eliminating cursing in your speech when talking to others or being more polite. But other things I can't agree with, like changing how you dress so that other people will like you more. Change how I dress so people like me? I think not. Some of this is individuality, not something that should be changed so that you can win a popularity contest.\n",

      "“The Noticer” by Andy Andrews, is a pleasant surprise of a read. The book illustrates a short story with a powerful punch; a story that I don’t want to spoil for any readers of this review. I’ll tell you this though, my husband and I participate in a highway clean up project sponsored by our township and when we first started he insisted that we pick up cans on the same side of the street and then pick up cans on the other side during the walk back, otherwise there would not be any cans for us to pick up during our walk back to where we started. I told him it wouldn’t matter if I picked up cans going the same direction as he yet on the other side of the road, for there would still be cans for us to pick up on the way back, because we would be viewing the roadside from a different perspective. “The Noticer” is about viewing our everyday lives from a different perspective and what a change in perspective can do to one’s world. Excellent read and one I am happy to recommend to everyone, no matter your perspective on life!\n",

      "This book oversimplifies life's struggles with a \"pray it away\" mentality. It also seems to plagiarize \"The 5 love languages\" by Gary Chapman with a weak attempt to cover its plagiarism by changing \"languages\" to \"dialects\" and taking one language away (receiving gifts). Jones is a boring character with no depth or redeeming quality, which makes it very unbelievable that so many people are willing to just let this know-it-all stranger tell them that their very real life struggles are just a \"matter of perspective\". I was especially disturbed by the chapter about the man with mental illness that was considering suicide. It perpetuates the stigma of mental illness as something that is the sufferers fault rather than an actual illness. \"just change your perspective\" really? Decades of mental health research and Andy Andrews had the answer all along...?\n",

      "The Noticer by Andy Andrews is 156 pages of important life lessons wrapped within a feel-good, inspirational novelette. The lessons are thinly-veiled homilies spoken by the main character Jones to a cast of (unfortunately) flat, characters who barely resemble real people with real dialogue. Still, the book’s lessons and overall message are positive, and Christian — without mentioning God too often. The book will appeal to mothers, grandmothers, fans of inspirational literature, and anyone who enjoys Hallmark greeting cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The barebones story is about an elderly, white-haired man named Jones who appears in a small town over the course of many years, always helping people gain a broader perspective on their trials and their blessings. For example: A man is saved from worry when Jones reminds him to focus only on what can be controlled. An old woman with nothing left to live for is inspired to begin living purposefully after Jones tells her that everything one does has an impact on someone else’s life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have nothing against this type of inspirational material, mind you. My basic problem with is that it would’ve been better off as non-fiction prose rather than as a pseudo novel. After all, the characters are throwaway paper cutouts. The real meat here lies in the life lessons — the wise nuggets scattered throughout the novel’s cliche-soaked melodrama and often cringe-worthy dialogue. Still, it’s worth a quick read on the plane, and would make an excellent Mother’s Day gift!\n",

      "My foundation as a writer was shaped by these stories. I first read most of them in 1984, when I went to grad school in writing at U of Colorado in Boulder. Lucia was one of several wonderful profs I had there, but it was her stories alone that I read, with awe, and said, \"THAT is what I want to do!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Quiet awe, by the way. That's the beauty of these stories. No kings or dukes or ladies in waiting losing their heads or fighting for the crown. No grand sweeping anything, no boisterous narrator, showing off. But no boring MFA stories full of pretty sentences about nothing, either. Just raw, gripping tales about switchboard operators, cleaning ladies and shy little Protestant girls trying to fit in in Catholic school.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are immediately engaging, with that voice, that draws you in with its candor as well as its insight. Lucia had an extraordinary ability to gaze right inside of people, sort of an emotional x-ray vision, with the people in her lives and her characters. (Of course those are the same--or the latter came from the former. She had that uncanny ability in life, and spilled it seemingly effortlessly onto the page.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifteen years later, when I published Columbine, you can witness my attempt to emulate Lucia on every page. I hope I was worthy. I keep reading her, trying to get closer to the Lucia ideal, though I never will. My favorite story is \"My Jockey,\" and I've read it probably 100 times. If I can do what she did there, once, ever, that will be enough.\n",

      "Bridget Read nel numero di agosto 2015 della rivista Lit Hub sottolinea come lo sguardo da estranea della Berlin è perfetto per affrontare una forma di racconto prettamente americana: l’uso stupefacente di colloquialismi e tic linguistici per creare subito personaggi che rimangono impressi, l’abilità nel trasformare luoghi qualunque come una lavanderia a gettoni e scene ordinarie di turismo balneare, con pochissima azione, in interi ecosistemi di personalità e di umanità, rafforzano l’idea che la prospettiva di una scrittrice donna sia la più adatta ad analizzare un paese di contraddizioni, un posto in cui capire chi viene ripulito e chi si occupa della ripulitura è vitale.\n",
      "Quest’ultimo concetto fa riferimento al doppio significato che può assumere il titolo originale della raccolta, anche titolo di uno dei racconti, , letteralmente “Manuale per donne delle pulizie”: ma, se ‘cleaning’ diventa il verbo e ‘women’ l’oggetto, potrebbe essere interpretato nel senso di ‘Manuale per pulire le donne’.\n",

      "Lydia Davis, en el prólogo al libro, nos dice que “Parte de la chispa de la prosa de Lucia está en el ritmo: a veces fluido y tranquilo, equilibrado, espontáneo y fácil; y a veces entrecortado, telegráfico, veloz.” Gustándome la mayor parte de los relatos, mi entusiasmo con el libro se debe más a los segundos, los entrecortados, los que parecen saltar caprichosamente de memoria en memoria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seguramente tenga toda razón Davis cuando adjudica el adjetivo espontáneo al primer bloque de cuentos. Sin embargo, son los del segundo los que a mí me han transmitido un mayor aire de libertad, una mayor sensación de \"verdad\", de falta de filtros, y más me han emocionado. A esa capacidad para emocionarme se suma (más bien, se multiplica) su capacidad para sorprenderme, su inteligencia para sugerir mucho con muy poco, su habilidad para envolver en sonrisas, ya compasivas ya alegres ya amargas, la tristeza, la desilusión, la añoranza que rezuman muchos de sus relatos.\n",

      "Lucía es una mujer con un enorme atractivo físico y personal, con una mirada que te atrapa y te somete, y no me refiero solo a sus ojos, preciosos, sino también a como esos ojos ven, a como esos ojos nos ven y, por encima de todo, a como ven a Lucía. Contradiciendo a la cita de Huidobro que encabeza uno de los mejores cuentos (“A ver esa sonrisa”), esa mirada, esos ojos, atraen más que la tumba, quizás porque trasmiten lo mismo que ella. Cualquiera hubiera podido advertirle aquello que le auguró una adivina: tendrás muchos amores y muchos problemas. Estar cerca de ella debió de ser lo más parecido a estar en el cielo y en el infierno al mismo tiempo, incluso de forma simultánea. Una persona impredecible, contradictoria, intensa tanto para lo bueno como para lo malo, incapaz de evitar la tentación, de sustraerse al placer del momento o de evitar el dolor momentáneo sin que las consecuencias que sus actos puedan tener sobre sí misma o en los demás pasen en ningún momento por su cabeza o tengan la fuerza suficiente para retener sus instintos. Alabo el conocimiento que tenía de sí misma y su valentía al afrontar su interior y hacernos partícipes de él (fantástico y terrible la verdad de Silencio). Y, aunque nos pone delante su infancia y la relación que mantuvo con su madre, no tengo la impresión de que Lucía se parapete tras ese escudo, al menos no totalmente. En fin, qué terrible y qué maravilloso tuvo que ser estar a su lado.\n",

      "As would be expected, the World War II hospital ship “Benevolence held nearly five hundred hospital beds, which were filled with soldiers who suffered everything from chest wounds to lost appendages to malaria and psychiatric maladies”. What the captain was unaware of was its illicit and entirely proscribed cargo of fuel, ammunition and weapons destined to aid the US war effort against the Japanese in the Solomon Islands. When a torpedo slammed into the ship and sent it to the bottom, the spy who called in the torpedo strike and eight other survivors including the captain and his wife, two nurses, a black American enlisted sailor, a young stowaway, a US naval officer and an injured Japanese naval officer find themselves marooned on the quintessential south Pacific tropical island.\n",

      "From Hilary Hatton at Booklist:\n",
      "It’s the fall of 1942, and the U.S. hospital ship Benevolence is cruising the waters of the South Pacific when it is torpedoed by the Japanese. Only nine people survive, and they eventually wash up on an island: the captain Joshua, and his wife, Isabelle, a nurse; Isabelle’s sister Annie and a woman named Scarlet, both nurses; Ratu, a teenage Fijian stowaway; Jake, a black engineer; Nathan and Roger, two officers; and Akira, a wounded Japanese soldier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, first of all, let’s look at the survivors of this accident. One: the captain of the ship. The captain. Don’t they go down with their ships anymore? Two: three nurses. One just happens to be the captain’s wife. The captain’s wife, even though they were not together on the ship at the time of the torpedoing. What are the odds?\n",
      "\n",
      "The next nurse just happens to be Annie, the captain’s wife’s sister. The captain’s wife’s s….you get the idea. )The third nurse is a “throwaway”: the character that can be killed off by the danger that stalks them all.)\n",
      "\n",
      "While it is only a matter of time before Japanese naval forces reach the island, the more immediate danger is Roger, who is a ship’s officer, but also a spy for the Japanese. It’s Roger who tipped the Japanese that, unbeknownst to the captain, the hospital ship was carrying ammunition and other supplies of war.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roger is drawn as a mentally unstable, sadistic, misogynistic, and overly proud man. No explanation is needed: after all, he’s the traitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain Joshua, the engineer Jake (the token black, who just happens to be the one who had befriended the ship’s stowaway – who also survived) and the other officer Nathan are, of course, kind, helpful, chivalrous, co-operative and generally nice guys. No explanation is needed: after all, they’re Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there’s Akira, a wounded Japanese soldier who was on the ship because the rules of war were that hospitals treat all wounded, regardless of nationality. Because Akira’s Japanese, the author spends the entire book explaining and justifying how it is possible that he might be human; a decent and kind human who is in love with Annie. (And how Annie could possibly love him.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Japanese who land on the island are all wicked, wicked. The Americans who come and bomb and kill the Japanese are heroes. Are we twelve years old?\n",
      "\n",
      "Beside a Burning Sea is a romance and, really, I shouldn’t have been venturing into this territory. I have no patience with such juvenile characterization and plot coincidences. The roster of survivors reminded me of a (quite bad) story that I wrote for a seventh grade English composition.\n",
      "\n",
      "If that’s romance literature and you enjoy it, then have yourself a read. But this is nowhere near being literature. I know I sound like a book snob when I say that, but I find that as I get older and realize that my time to read is running out, I want to read solid fiction (and my snackies of cozy murder mysteries). If I’m going to read romance, at least let it be disguised in a half-decently written story (such as The Diplomat’s Wife.)\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I really enjoyed this book. John Shors is the perfect writer for me, because his books (so far) are based in Asia and have strong female protagonists (which both appeal to me very much!).\n",
      "\n",
      "I would give Beside a Burning Sea four-and-a-half stars, but that's not possible on goodreads. I didn't love it quite as much as Beneath a Marble Sky--mostly because in that book I learned so much about Indian history and the building of the Taj Mahal. But I couldn't put this book down and was desperate to discover whether everyone would make it off the island alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story begins on the hospital ship Benevolence in the middle of World War II. Benevolence gets shot down by a torpedo, and nine survivors make it to an uninhabited nearby island. Seven Americans, one Fijian boy, and one Japanese soldier...and one traitor and villain among them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had two very minor criticisms of the book. 1. The main Japanese character, Akira, spoke near-perfect English (he was an English professor before he became a soldier). After teaching English to Japanese adults who had been studying the language for years, I found his conversational skills a bit too perfect for reality. 2. The traitor/villain could speak Japanese because he grew up in Japan, but the U.S. military never learned that about him? But neither of these issues affected my overall enjoyment of the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some things I loved about the book:\n",
      "\n",
      "--The haikus that began each chapter (divided into days), which reflected what was going on at that stage of the book\n",
      "\n",
      "--Shors' writing of Akira's appreciation of beauty, particular natural beauty, which was reminiscent of the Japanese aesthetic and appreciation for the natural world\n",
      "\n",
      "--The interracial romances and deep, abiding friendships developed during the story\n",
      "\n",
      "--The wide diversity of characters developed\n",
      "\n",
      "--The strong female characters\n",
      "\n",
      "--The rapid pace of the story and the tensions created between the characters\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I would give it two thumbs up! I look forward to Shors' next novel, which will take place in modern-day Saigon.\n",
      "\n",
      "One final note about Shors: I have been very impressed upon reading about Shors' creative methods for getting his books better known. After Beneath a Marble Sky was published, he included his e-mail address at the end of the book and encouraged book groups to contact him. He talked (via phone or in person) to over 1,000 book groups! I'm sure that really helped a great deal to get the word out...and no doubt helped to get Amy Tan's endorsement on the front of this new novel!\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I loved, loved, loved this book! When their hospital ship is torpedoed, nine escape including one Japanese POW and take refuge on a lovely island. Unfortunately one of the nine is a traitor who enjoys tormenting and killing. While with the group he tries to act civilized but he is soon suspected especially by the Japanese Akira. A child, Ratu is also with the group. He had stowed away in search of his father. While the traitor communicates with the Japanese bringing them to the island, the survivors thrive to survived. In the meantime, one nurse and Akira fall in love.\n",
      "Akira had once been a teacher and had never gone to war. Annie feels lost in the shadow of her older sister.\n",
      "This is a beautiful romance with Ratu adding a great deal of comedy. Even in the middle of war, danger, a blood thirsty traitor, that two on opposite sides can fall in love and set aside their differences was to me amazing.\n",
      "Now I have to read the other books written by this writer!!!!\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I loved this book. Beside a Burning Sea is so well written, and just such a big story- one I will not soon forget. This book follows a group of survivors after a hospital ship is sunk in the Pacific off the coast of the Soloman Islands in WWII. The characters manage to swim ashore a deserted island and the astounding trials they face throughout this book will keep you on your toes. All of the characters have their own traits/problems/personalities but my favorite characters were Big Jake and Ratu, I really enjoyed the development of their relationship as father/son. This is a book of survival, love, family, and heartbreak. So far I've read three books by John Shows and I've loved them all so far. I highly recommend Beside a Burning Sea and look forward to reading more of John Shors' books in the future.\n",

      "\"I'd love to see your whole gaping snatch hole just munching on that orgasm, just chewing on that big sweet piece of half-melted pleasure that's hidden inside you,\" says Nicholson Baker, and what the hell is that? Who says that? Why would you say that? Is it supposed to be funny? Sexy? Naughty? It isn't any of those things, this weird combination of baby talk and overwrought metaphor that's Baker's unfortunate trademark. \"His cock train was commuting in and out of her pussyhole,\" he says, and okay I guess that one's a little funny, but the problem is there are like 250 pages of shit like that and it gets This is, like, you know that one uncle you have who still wears his hair in a pony tail even though he's got a massive bald spot? And he wears silly t-shirts that say \"No One Knows I'm a Lesbian\"? Nicholson Baker writes for that guy. It's not for you. You should snicker half-heartedly at the quotes in my review - \"she DJ'd herself as if her clit was a scratch record,\" he says - and then go read a book for grown-ups. \"I'll spunk ham juice out everywhere,\" Nicholson Baker warns. Don't let Nicholson Baker get his ham juice near you, friend. Stay away.\n",

      "This is the easily the worst book I've read (let alone bought new in freaking hardcover!) in as long as I can remember. I want my money back and the time it took to read the first 100 pages and skim the rest. The tone is off, I think. If you're gonna basically present pornographic magical realism without much character development or plot, the language should probably be a lot more elevated so there's at least a bit of titillating conflict between form and content, and this author knows how to elevate language. Instead, everything is flattened, debased, there's nothing interesting except the occasional clever name for genitalia (\"purple cameroon\"), it's cartoonish but I didn't laugh because there was nothing to really bring me into it. That is, the simplicity of the language worked against engaging me. There were also errors, a misspelling and an unnecessary preposition in the first sentence of a chapter. At best it could have been like a hypererotic version of Padgett Powell's or more recent George Saunders, but this doesn't try to suggest existential or sociopolitical dealios beyond its surface. It doesn't seem to critique a sex-crazed culture of idiocy at all and really just complies with it, more like a product of the author's childish prurient imagination than anything anyone could get anything from -- not even turned on. For all the genitalia on display it's not even arousing. It's a good idea, I'd say, but the execution just seemed to miss by miles. Disappointingly lame, ultimately.\n",

      "You know how there are certain writers -- Ian McEwan, Julian Barnes, Peter Carey-types -- who are such darlings of the literary world that we joke that they could probably write anything and be lauded by The New York Times?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is Nicholson Baker writing that \"anything\" book, trying that experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a blurb on the back of House of Holes from Charles McGrath, of The New York Times Magazine, that reads: \"When he is not writing about sex (and also when he is), Baker is one of the most beautiful, original, ingenious prose stylists to have come along in decades.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And here is an excerpt of beautiful writing from this book: \"He breathed little panting breaths, his hips rocking as he flummoxed his beatstick.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "OK. I get that this is satire of our oversexed culture. I get that it is super nasty and lewd and full of crazy kinks, because that's how people are under our polite societal veneer, and . But...\"beautiful\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a book that has multiple instances of Bad Sex Award quality writing. In fact, there is probably one passage every fifteen pages that is deserving of such nomination. I respect Baker really shooting for the stars of ludicrousness (pun totally intended). But I don't have much love for seeing it called \"beautiful.\" A writer with no reputation producing the same sort of material would almost certainly get laughed off the page. I think next year Gary Shteyngart should write an entire book about scat fetish and see what happens; it'll probably be nominated for the National Book Award.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two stars because even though I sort of like what Baker was trying to do here, the long, detailed, purposely vulgar and purple descriptions of sex are boring. I would have liked to see more world-building and less, uh, play-by-play, because the House of Holes sexual theme park is a great idea.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Many friendly men and women frequent a magical theme park of debauchery wherein they have copious amounts of consensual magical-realist sex in every nook and cranny they find. Think of a bordello conceived, designed and operated by Salvador Dalí and Luis Buñuel, both in particularly pleasant and playful moods. It costs some big money to have all the sex you want with detached arms, phallus-bearing trees, sentient tanning beds and friendly staff studs whose bodily emissions boast holistic health benefits, but the HoH offers plenty of opportunities for debtors to wank, spank and buck their way out of the red. Not a mean-spirited thought is to be found amidst this novel's large cast of hyper-sexual cartoon characters, nor is there any serious metaphorical heft to the many brief vignettes that comprise this novel; instead, this novel is a celebration of climaxes every few pages, a pageantry of hilarious sexual phrases, a romance of the human body and its fluids, an argument that foreplay is all imagination, and the closest thing you will ever find to wholesome hardcore pornography. Perfect as a stocking-stuffer come the holidays or as a beach read that can double as a fetching codpiece.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "HoH is perhaps the funniest Baker novel—U & I is a neurotic treat and parts of The Mezzanine and The Anthologist are rife with very precise hilarity—but for rollicking inventiveness, wordplay, and deep-throated porno-parody, this Book of Raunch shades the win. Imagine a pornographic utopia (the opposite of online porn portals and real-life sex rings) where all participants have manners and seek permission to poke into the desired holes, who during the coital acts never access the nastiest parts of their feral animal behaviour to cause pain or debasement. Those who have participated in an orgy will know that decorum is paramount alongside impeccable hygiene, and manners cost nothing even in a nine-way human conga line of buggery. Baker knows his porno politesse. Mike archived some memorable phrases from the book . A real slapandtickle giggle—and about as erotic as a naked MJ slathered in salad cream.\n",

      "In 24 hours, I have digested the 290 pages that comprise this book. To some, this is no extraordinary feat. For me, it is certainly not the norm. I have read several good books over the years. There are books that tell a good story. This book is one of those books. However, it went much further than that. This book grabbed me and sucked me in emotionally opening my eyes to things that have been buried for far too long. There are so many messages that are conveyed as a part of this story line. Some of these are direct and to the point. Others are much less obvious and perhaps only comprehended on a subconscious level. This is the first book I have read from this author, but I immediately felt connected to the main character in the book (Alan) along with the challenges and emotions that he experiences along the beginning of his journey. Everyone will have their own take on each book they read and I would never suggest that any one book will be life changing for everyone. But, it is certainly possible that this book can be life changing for someone. I don't know if it has been life changing for me, but it certainly has set me out on the first step of my own \"Walk\" and time will tell if this step helps me learn to live every moment to the fullest.\n",

      "My husband listened to this book on CD thinking it was just one book, not realizing it is part of a series. He loved it and suggested I read it. The very first thing I did, was go online and read all the negative reviews. The two complaints were that this book was a waste of money because it is part of a series (I don't care because I will just get it from the library) and the second complaint was that is was too much writing about food...all the bed and breakfast food, cafes and small diners. Neither of these complaints were offensive to me. I am very picky about reading books on grief. I would hate the complaints to be over simplified the devastation a person feels when losing a loved one or unrealistic romances shortly after etc. I actually find it interesting that a book about grief would center a lot on food but from my own personal experience, food was not something that was helpful but for others, it was. So I read it and found it was very interesting, an easy read, a well written and thought out story line with just enough drama to keep it real and interesting. I think most people would enjoy it.\n",

      "I read this book because I had to sign for my 12 year old to check this out of the middle school library and I could not find a review that gave me any idea why this would not be appropriate. I'm still not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a good story, and boys will especially enjoy it. The story centers around Marcus, a high school junior who is new to town, and Charlie Popovitch, a former NFL player. Marcus was a standout quarterback at his old school, but is not received well at his new school, where the team has an outstanding quarterback, who happens to be the son of Charlie. The team is also in pursuit of a record 2nd consecutive undefeated season. Marcus takes to working out on his own in the town park, when he meets up with Charlie. He is not aware that Charlie is either the former NFLer OR the father of the team quarterback, and is confused by Charlie's behavior. Charlie sometimes acts more like a misguided teenager than a responsible adult, pulling pranks and walking out of stores without paying. Marcus soon discovers, through a Google search, that Charlie is among a number of NFL players suffering from early-onset Alzheimers, the result of multiple concussions. This is a fact his family works hard to deny and hide. The book is full of football, which will make it interesting to boys.\n",

      "There may be reasons you would not want a 12 year old to read this book, although I think it woudl be fine for most 12 year olds. Read the rest of this only if you don't care that there are spoilers.\n",
      "There is some very mild sexual content. The head cheerleader offers to manage the team equipment. There is a reference to making out in a closet, but nothing more. And Marcus has thoughts about tackling a a 'different kind of body contact'. But I think for many 12 years olds, this would go right past them, and if it didn't, chances are they've seen more on TV. There are also parties with alcohol. And Marcus does things that are not quite within the law more than once, but always for good reason.\n",
      "This could lead to some good discussions with kids about standing up for what you think is right, regardless of consequences; or of knowing when right is right and wrong is wrong. But to me, posibly the worst thing is the ending,\n",

      "This bone-jarring, hard-hitting story lands straight home with a \"POP\"! Marcus Jordan must decide what's best for former NFL linebacker Charlie Popovich, King of Pop, who lives in the distant past. Charlie believes Marcus to be a college friend, when he's 54 and Marcus is in high school. Football, love, and an incurable disease clash in Gordon Korman's novel Pop!\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The title of the book refers to a collision in football or the \"pop\". In this book, it also refers to one of main characters named Charlie Popovich who played football in the NFL and was nicknamed the \"King of Pop\". He liked being a player who made the \"pop\" happen. At the local park, Charlie (now middle-aged) befriends a young man named Marcus who is new to town and getting in shape for football season. The two become unlikely friends until Marcus makes a shocking discovery about Charlie. This is a more serious book from Gordon Korman. Excuse the pun, but this book \"tackles\" some very serious subject matter. The author does not shy away from tragedy in this book. The tragedy is unpredictable but very realistic, just like \"real life\".\n",

      "It's summer vacation and Vespa-riding teenager Marcus Jordan is the new kid in town, having just moved with his mom from Kansas to Upstate New York. The previous fall, back in Olathe, Marcus had been the record-setting star quarterback on the JV squad. He's planning to try out for the varsity team at his new high school in Kennesaw, a team that completed a perfect 11-0 championship season last year. In preparation, Marcus has found a deserted park in town -- home to a modern art statue that looks like \"a titanic paper airplane had fallen from the sky\" -- where he has been practicing by himself with a ball and an empty picture frame suspended on a rope as a target.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sucking in a lungful of moist, heavy air, Marcus pumped once and unleashed the longest pass of the day, a loose spiral that nevertheless seemed to have a lot of power behind it. It sailed high over the apex of the Paper Airplane before beginning its downward trajectory toward the hoop.\n",
      "\"Suddenly, for the first time in four days, Marcus spied another human being in the park. The figure was just a blur across his field of vision. It leaped into the air, picked off the pass, and kept on going.\n",
      "\"The receiver made a wide U-turn and, grinning triumphantly, jogged up to Marcus.\n",
      "\"Marcus smiled too. 'Nice catch, bro--'\n",
      "\"He was looking at a middle-aged man, probably around fifty years old. He was tall and built like a redwood. But the guy ran like a gazelle and had caught the ball with sure hands, tucking it in tight as he ran. He had definitely played this game before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So begins the story of Marcus Jordan and Charlie Popovich. Charlie, it turns out, is a beloved hometown hero, having returned to Kennesaw to raise a family after completing a long career as a linebacker in the National Football League. Charlie is a man with the heart of a kid.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This Charlie character might be weird, but his enthusiasm had sucked Marcus in.\n",
      "\"The ball plunged down, and Marcus gathered it into his arms.\n",
      "\"Something hit him. The impact was so jarring, so unexpected, that there was barely time to register what was happening. It was Charlie -- he'd rammed a rock-hard shoulder into Marcus's sternum and dropped him where he stood. The ball squirted loose, but Marcus wasn't even aware of it. He lay like a stone on the grass, ears roaring, trying to keep from throwing up his breakfast.\n",
      "\"Gasping, he scrambled to his feet, squaring off against his companion. 'What was that for?'\n",
      "\"'I love the pop! Sometimes you actually hear it go pop!'\"\n",

      "Charlie is now paying a steep price for all those years of putting hits on opposing players. He often seems to believe that he is still the old mischief making high school football star he'd been in the early Seventies. Literally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlie's family is desperately trying to hide their knowledge of what is behind his peculiar behavior, and there is conflict with Charlie's own teens when they find out that Marcus has been hanging out in Three Alarm Park with their father.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have often had good things to say about Gordon Korman's storytelling, but POP is really something else. It is pretty intense to have read the book within days of Natasha Richardson's untimely death from a brain injury suffered in a fall while skiing down a beginner slope. It has me recalling the current condition of my childhood hero Muhammad Ali. It makes me think of my younger brother whose life has been colored for the past twenty-five years by the long-term effects of a near-fatal skull fracture suffered in a crash when his friend fell asleep behind the wheel and wrapped the car around a tree. And I think about watching Steve Young suffer concussion after concussion during his reign as quarterback of our San Francisco 49ers, and wondering whether he'd someday suffer long-term effects from them.\n",

      "I also think about the kids in our town who come flying down hilly roads on skateboards without helmets.\n",

      "\"The park wasn't as empty as it had been during the summer. There were a few young mothers pushing babies in strollers, and an elderly couple chatting on a bench in the shadow of the Paper Airplane.

      "\"No, that wasn't quite right. Charlie did remember. He remembered what still made the most sense to him -- being young and wild and invincible, taking on the world with his best friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "POP goes well beyond the story of Marcus and Charlie. There is also Marcus struggling to become a part of the David Nathan Aldrich High School football team and dealing with the hot shot quarterback who led last year's championship team; there is Marcus matching wits and locking lips with Alyssa Fontaine, the gorgeous head cheerleader who \"designs zone blitzes in her sleep;\" and there are the repeated references to Marcus's relationship with his own estranged father back in Kansas (a.k.a. Comrade Stalin).\n",

I still can't watch a football game without cringing at all the head-hitting, which is why I'm rating this book today, right after the Super Bowl reminded me how much I loved it. It tells a beautiful tale of a boy trying to fit in and make his name great in the football world, while also shedding light on the plight of players long past their prime, who have to live with the consequences of really \"giving their all\" back in the day. It was a really great book that serves as a cautionary tale highlighting the dangers of concussions, and I'd recommend it to anyone participating in high school sports or with a child doing the same.\n",

I thought she wrote the regency setting well, I was sucked into the story and had to keep reading to see how it would all play out. I enjoyed the plot for this one, a bit different than your usual Regency. Alice fell for Lord Fenton when she was a child. Ten years later they are reunited and thrown into an engagement-of-convenience when he is forced to marry to prevent being disinherited. Lord Fenton has spent the past ten years attempting to vex his father in the best way he knew how, by being an irresponsible dandy.\n",

It was fun seeing them banter and to watch his feelings change for Alice and see him come to appreciate her and all she has to offer. They do have a sweet romance.\n",

You don't have to read these in order, though, and not least because Fenton's character changes a bit between books. I mean, this Fenton isn't the kind of guy Thomas could be such good friends with, I don't think. Fortunately, Thomas isn't present in this one (besides an inconsequential letter or something), so you don't have to deal with any retroactive changes in him to fit this story.\n",

Alice is a bit naïve for her age, but since her parents haven't been able to afford a London season until now, it makes sense that she'd make the mistakes (and discoveries) that she does. I liked her acceptance of her situation and how willing she was to make the best out of her (much diminished) circumstances despite the expectations of her youth. I totally get her falling for present-day Fenton and her initial rose-colored glasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kilpack shows her skill, once again, by setting these two realistically at loggerheads and still deciding to go through with their betrothal. Indeed, half of the story takes place after their marriage and I actually buy the excuses for why they're still not physically intimate, keeping this a chaste book (and not just because they're not intimate in any other ways, either, and haven't even a modicum of trust between them). The only problem with the story is how tedious Fenton becomes as we learn that his initial instability and flaws run deeper than we knew. Okay, it doesn't help that the origin and continuation of his insecurity doesn't actually work if you know anything about male sexuality*, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I was never tempted to put the story down and was fully engaged throughout. Most of that is Alice and her backbone as she pulls up her stays and does her best given her circumstances. But part of it, too, is the sense of how compatible they really are and that they come together if they can learn to forgive and be tolerant of one another. And Kilpack manages to make you believe that they can get there by sprinkling in the lighter moments and almost-connections in ways that were believably fragile but still hope-inducing.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this ends up being 3½ stars that I'm rounding down just because Fenton was so wearying and I had to rewrite the basis of his hang-ups in my head*. Not a bad story, and certainly engaging, but Kilpack can do, and has done, better.\n",
      "\n",
      ": I'm spoiler-tagging this not so much because it's a spoiler (though it is, a little bit) but because many readers probably don't care. Also, it's going to be squirmingly frank about male sexuality so don't go there if you're sensitive to that kind of thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ": The main couple in this story are very chaste and there is no sex anywhere near present during the narrative. Which I consider very chaste. That said, much of the story deals with marital infidelity and the consequences of adultery in Regency England with Fenton's father centrally featured. The hurt and pain and lasting damage to others is dealt with in some detail so if you're sensitive to the kinds of discussions that arise around that kind of thing, then you might want to give this a pass.\n",

      "Now in book two, Robley, one of the bit players in book one with a thirst for adventure has decided he wants to travel to the future, back to where Alethia came from. He enters into a bargain with the faerie madam Giselle and finds himself in modern day Minnesota, literally landing on top student midwife, Erin. Like Alethia, Erin is descended from faeries and has some healing powers, and it soon becomes apparent that Giselle is pulling strings in her own little theatre.\n",

      "This first section didn't impress me all that much. Calling a spade a spade, I could easily have walked away and considered it. It strikes me that what makes a book about time travel work is in taking a modern person and putting them into a foreign situation...the past. The interest in the history behind a book can sustain it...taking a person from the past and putting him/her into a modern environment doesn't have that going for it. I mean seeing somebody's amazement at flushing toilets doesn't really hold your attention for more than a minute.\n",

His love for Erin was sweet and he was sexy as hell!\n",

      "The Highlander's Bargain is an engrossing, heart grabbing, five star read. The story is well written and pulls you in as soon as you start reading. I was captivated with Robley and Erin's story. I loved that Robley was strong where Erin was weak and vice versa. They just worked so well together. The story was romantic, filled with intrigue, action and a few unexpected twists and turns. I just love when an author catches me off balance and I can say \"What?!?\" and this happened a few times in The Highlander's Bargain. Barbara Longley does an excellent job providing moments to savor throughout the story. There were times I just had to stop after reading a passage in order to smile, laugh, cry or to sigh with pleasure over what I had just read. Anytime a book allows me to do these things I consider that book to be awesome, and The Highlander's Bargain was awesome.. Barbara Longley researches carefully before writing her books and this careful research was evident throughout The Highlander's Bargain. This book captivated my heart and is one I will read many times over. Thank you Barbara Longley for a well written, exciting read! Kudos!!!\n",

      "\n",
      "I Loved Reading \"Highlander's Bargain\".!! Robley MacKintosh wants some adventure in his life before he must marry. He decides to travel to the years 2010.This is the period of time where is cousin-in-law Alethia Goodsky, know as True, is from. True is married to Robley's cousin Malcolm of Clan Mackintosh and future Earl see bk1 \"True to the Highlander\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Robley seeks out Madame Giselle who pose as a fortune telling, but is much more then that. She is a Fae of the Tuatha De' Danann. She is the Fae that bought True to there time. Madame Giselle agree to Robley's proposition. He must first retrieve a silver platter for her in the land of the Fae. Its seems an easy enough task and Robley preforms it quickly with Giselle placing him in the right place in the King of the Fae's court. Giselle gives Robley two crystals for his travel too and from the future and back to his time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Erin Durie is working at the Renaissance Festival in Shakopee, Minnesota, while on her break a man appears out of a cloud of smoke and blue light. It's Robley and he fall right on top of her. Erin is a Surgical OB/GYN nurse working on her master degree to become a license midwife. They hit it off pretty quickly. Erin believes he's from the past becasue she has special gifts and his story about where he came from rings true.\n",
      "Erin allows Robley to live with her and she guilds him in living in the 21'st century. Robley meets another time travel Connor and his 21st century family and he offers Robley a job. The characters are amazing and funny the banter between all of them was great. I love this story!! Another Fae shows up giving Robley 30days to fine the Platter which is a Pensive. At first he thinks Robley stole it. But Robley explains about Giselle. The Fairy Whirls Robley and Erin back to his time. At first Erin feels stuck but her skills as midwife are greatly needed and she even saves the life of True and delivers her twin boys successfully. Is this what Madame Giselle wanted all the time? I loved the way Erin took too the past and helped so many people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great romance an fairly good love scenes. Robley was not shocked to find his new wife was not a virgin. But I was a little. The story is very fasted paced. A real page turner. With lots of fun and lively characters some new, but most are from bk1. A very good story!! I Highly Recommend the Novels Of Loch Moigh .\n",

      "Wow!!!! What an intense whirlwind of a book- this initially started off with a lot of oblique grief and embitterment and there was definitely a lot of timely existentialism in some of the POVs- needless to say the Flaccus situation was just an obstacle that my nerves didn't need in this stage of the game although I am greatly anticipating the climax that is being built up. I loved what I perceive to be the pinnacle in the character's personality growth in learning to adapt to adversity and found the resolution that the gang, bar Flavia, all became a massive Christian Union society entertaining- although I think the introduction of St John was really beautifully done and tempered with emotional poignancy- evidently all I hope for now is some progression in the Gemina family fortunes. Despite previous misgivings I also find myself really engaging in the Aristo/Nubia relationship and frequently saw their interaction as lovely moments of relief during the otherwise intense storyline. I am so excited/nervous for the next (and final!) book but considering the amount of resolution to overarching storylines so far I have high anticipations!\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A ridiculous and frustrating book in what has so far been such an amazing series. No mystery to speak of, the whole book dedicated to the children and Aristo \"finding God\" 🤦 Why oh why did Lawrence have to turn this into a preachy sermon on Christianity????\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Cover Blurb: Like with all of the Roman Mysteries book covers, I like the simplicity and color scheme, as well as how it looks like a painting. This particular cover out of the series is one of the less interesting ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I Liked: As always, I like Nubia; she continues to be the most level-headed, best tempered, and most considerate of the four friends. I will always love Jonathan, but in this book his reoccurring pessimism and “oh, it’s all my fault” attitude really got on my nerves. While certainly it would take forever for someone to reconcile themselves with something as terrible as the fire in Rome, I couldn’t help but roll my eyes and sigh when Jonathan brought it back up. He’s beaten that horse enough already.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked Flavia in the first book, but I really don’t like her anymore. It’s been fifteen books and she still hasn’t matured. She seems her age - twelve - and therefore it is really hard to find anything romantic about her crush on Flaccus. It’s even harder to believe that Flaccus loves her because - hello! She’s twelve! And she is definitely not mature for her age! It’s just . . . creepy. I know, twelve was an acceptable age for the Romans, but you know what - it’s still creepy. And not at all romantic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caroline Lawrence does her historical research; that has always been true. She’s always managed to take her four young detectives places in a plausible fashion, and have things happen to them that the Reader could actually see happening. It’s no different in this installment. All of the research is there, the plausibility. And she even goes a step further with her believability when everyone converts to Christianity, but Flavia doesn’t. I was afraid that the Author would have her convert, and I was never convinced that Flavia would ever give up her Roman faith. She’s not that sort of person.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s nothing special. She is wonderful at historical description, and often relates historical facts and myths through the characters’ dialogue in a way that doesn’t lessen the dialogue’s believability. But her writing is very moment-by-moment, and she overworks the cliffhanger - every single chapter literally ends in one.\n",
      "\n",
      "This one had no content of which to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is where the story fell down. The Author did a terrific job in connecting the loose ends of to this one. She had a good setup and an intriguing villain that we fans have been wonderful about ever since was first released. But then suddenly everything comes crashing down around our heads. I hate, simply hate it when an Author has a good villain, and then that villain repents, turns all good, and everyone goes home happy. It destroys everything in the story; turns it sour; leaves the Reader utterly unsatisfied. And that is exactly how I felt with this book’s conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is meant more for the middle school level, and while I am an adult, I still enjoy this series, perhaps mostly because I’ve been reading it since I was ten years old. This is both a girl and guy read.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "After their adventures on the Nile, the young detectives are hiding out in Alexandria because they're wanted by the Emperor - why, they don't know. Fortunately, their tutor Aristo finds them, and tells them there have been more kidnappings of freeborn children, including Flavia's baby cousin Popo. Flavia's father and Flaccus have gone to Halicarnassus to find the children. They all sneak out of Egypt and get to Halicarnassus right after the kidnappers have fled, leaving the children behind. While on their trail, they encounter a Christian prophet who, people say, can heal people, including the dumb. Lupus hopes he can restore his tongue so he can talk again. Needless to say, a whole lot more happens before the end of the book. This is the penultimate book of the series, and I'm expecting many plot threads to be wound up in the final one.\n",

      "A fun read, that was the perfect fix for my Star Wars addiction. The story has some glaring issues, as the Diversity Alliance (big bad guys) are extremely inconsistent. It’s similar to Marvel, where the bad guy has extremely reasonable requests and then just murders civilians for no reason. The diversity alliance is literally fighting colonialism and racism, but then they will do something that is evil and makes no sense. Also, the author is creating this big bad diversity alliance, and from the name you can tell it’s reactionary and written as a dog whistle. That being said, the action was pretty good and the characters are well done. Overall, for finding this book at a garage sale, I found this to be a fun read.\n",

      "Review 1\n",
      "==============\n",
      "As it very often happens, I came to this book through another one. When I first started I thought I was handling a novel, but as I progressed, I realized Emmanuele Trevi had written a double elegy on his friends Pia Pera (1956-2016) and Rocco Carbone (1962-2008), both of whom had been writers. In his book, Trevi mentioned Pera’s and so I followed the literary trail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Written in 1995, Pia Pera presents an alternative account of Nabokov’s Lolita. Hers is the diary of Dolores Schlegel (formerly Maze - not Haze), that she, who is well alive, brings to John Ray for publication. She wants her view of things to be known. The diary is written as a continuous narrative, divided in chapters, and with no Calendar headings. What creates the texture of a diary is Lo’s tone - very spontaneous and direct.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the novel was going to be published in the Anglosaxon world, Vladimir Nabokov’s son, Dmitri, sued to stop the sale of the book. This was in 1998. Pera’s publishers (Farrar, Strauss and Giroux) held back until the legal matter was solved. Solved, in a way, it did, with a monetary settlement and with the agreement that Dmitri Nabokov would include a preface of his that could not be read by Pera until publication of her novel. But it seems that Preface never saw the light.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Italian edition I have is from 2018, that is, a couple of years after Pia Pera’s death from multiple sclerosis, but it includes a postface titled “A moral critique of Lolita in the shape of a Nabokovian scherzo”. I don’t know the date of this postface but in it Pera makes a defense of rewritings of famous literary works presenting ten arguments, which I will not reproduce here. I will however select the one that seems most obvious of all, and which belongs to what the French call ‘l’imaginaire collectif”. To reuse Nabokov’s mythical Lolita can easily be ranked to the same category as earlier remakings – Euripides’s dramatizing the Trojan Women, Shakespeare using Bandello or Plutarch, Jean Rhys relying on Brontë, or Pat Barker modernizing the Trojan saga (Homer and Virgil). This edition is prefaced by Emmanuel Trevi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another aspect is to what extent do rewritings offer much interest. Trevi thinks that they do not; he considers it a major hinderance that the reader needs to know the original work, limiting its appeal. This criticism he elaborates In Due Vite and uses as an example of the absurdity of producing “derivative literature” precisely a book that had been recently published, and which I have read and recently - Pat Barker’s – the retelling of the Trojan war from the point of view of Briseis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trevi, however, in the preface to Pera’s novel also makes a very strong defense. The end of Nabokov’s Lolita awakens in the reader the suspicion that Humbert’s account may not be reliable – that the whole story is humbug. Pia Pera’s novel then is a response to this very conjecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "One further interesting parallel between Pia Pera and Vladimir Nabokov is that she was a translator of Russian literature. Her Onegin is supposed to be rendered in a strikingly beautiful Italian; and another of Nabokov’s major works is his translation into English of Pushkin poem. She worked on this in parallel to her Lolita Diary, struggling with the two very different styles of writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Lo’s diary itself. The most interesting thing for me, when reading the Humbert-Lolita pair as seen by the latter, was that it is not a vengeful and predictive and stereotypical feminist view. Pera’s Lo comes across as a very provocative adolescent who faces her life and the world of adults in a highly rebellious and refractory manner. Her sassy voice is often offensive and insolent. She comes across as a clever schemer for whom the reader will feel a mix of pity (what has happened to her soul?) and rejection. For me the one drawback was that Lo’s character and circumstances are so developed so intensely and along may be too many pages that at times so much impertinence became somewhat tedious.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Fuck the haters and fuck the snobs. This was a more than valid take on Nabokov's Lolita from Lo's perspective. It is by turns gaudy, hilarious, embarrassing, pungent, wicked, inelegant, rambling, shambling and surprisingly thoughtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "I put myself at a distinct disadvantage reviewing it now, though -- at least for the sake of making comparisons -- as I haven't read Nabokov's Lolita in many years and have just started reading Emily Prager's Roger Fishbite, the Lolita-from-Lolita's-perspective novel most often compared to Pera's attempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pera committed a number of apparently unpardonable sins by writing this, the most oft-cited being that it lacks the stylistic, writerly skill exhibited by Nabokov, a criticism that makes me wonder what otherwise supposedly intelligent literary critics -- who should know better and exhibit a sense of perspective and humor -- were smoking. I suppose that every dinner they eat is catered by Sardi's as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another sin Pera commits is that she depicts as a willing, self-aware seductress with a sexual identity; and not as the simplistic idealized, infantilized baby that too many do-gooders delude themselves into thinking that 12-to-14-year-old humans are.\n",
      "\n",
      "A further sin is that the much-vaunted, charming and certainly unreliable Humbert is made into far less than Nabokov's poetic tragic figure. Pera's and Lo's take on him is as a pathetic, pusillanimous boor; a grotesque aesthete sporting dentures and moles sprouting grey hairs. The only reason Lo seduces him is to gain revenge against the mother she so detests. It's this tense, alienating bond between Lo and her mother, and not necessarily the relationship between Humbert and Lo that marks Pera's primary interpersonal dynamic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once her initial seduction aims are achieved, though, the tables are turned and Lo becomes a virtual sex slave to the paranoid Humbert. Lo's desperate longings to escape this situation, as the two make their infamous year-long cross-country trip, make for sometimes heartrending reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book when paired with Nabokov's original put me to mind of John Fowles' , the story of the abduction of a beautiful college student told from the perspective of both the abductor and the abductee. The first half of the book is the story as told entirely from the mentally unbalanced perspective of the obsessive butterfly collector who is making his first foray into kidnapping and imprisoning his vision of the ideal girl. Needless to say, his take on things is fairly unreliable. The second half of that book tells the story from the perspective of the captive, a far more reliable narrator, and yet one as oddly unsympathetic from the reader's perspective as the abductor's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pera turns Lolita on its head by making both characters unsympathetic, especially Humbert. During the course of the book, Lo evolves from a cruel girl lacking empathy (animal abuse runs in the family) to someone who seems to be gaining tolerance and perspective, while Humbert seems to devolve in the throes of his persnickety ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "is breathless trash, and should be enjoyed as such. The sex is not explicit (perhaps this fact also frustrated the critics). In fact, the book's most transgressive element is perhaps the depth of mother hatred that Lo exhibits. Her rantings and lashings and vicious fantasies directed at her pathetic mother are often wince-inducing and hilarious; and probably also contribute to the ire of readers and critics stuck on the notion of undying mother love.\n",
      "\n",
      "You gotta love a book that devastates the Nabokov/Lolita sacred cow and drives the pompous literati apeshit, making Humbert half impotent and Lo the most calculating vixen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The critics who say this doesn't read like a valid young teen's diary miss the point I think. Even if the voice and its sophistication of thought seem frequently above the level of what we'd expect from a 12- to- 14- year-old, the book's reconstruction of the of an angry adolescent is convincing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps what some staunch defenders are also objecting to is that by telling the story from the other side, Pera has had to fill out some of the absurd conceits glossed over in Nabokov's original, the Hotel California-ish aspect of Clare Quility/Gerry Sue Filthy's surreal mansion, for instance. I never did like the Clare Quilty tangents in the original novel and by exploring them Pera possibly ends up showing why they don't really work in the original. In this version, Lo states up front that Humbert's version of the story of his rival for Lo's attention is overstated, which makes sense, given how unreliable a narrator Humbert was.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to admit, this book was a bit sluggish to start; Humbert doesn't enter the story until page 73. From there it picks up. If you can hang with this book -- messy and sometimes tedious though it may be -- and look at it with an open mind, you might appreciate its accomplishment.\n",

      "the cool cover with the vellum overlay was the best thing about this book.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "All I have heard about this book is just bad, bad, bad. So I went in with extremely low expectations. And I have to admit, this is definitely not as good as Emily Prager's version of the same idea, Roger Fishbite. Both novels tell the story of Lolita from her own perspective, as opposed her dirty-old-man-abuser, Humbert. While Prager's version comes off as lyrically quirky and daringly brilliant, Pera's rendition drags on with a flat, unrealistically erudite voice that I could never imagine coming from a twelve-year-old girl, especially one as uninterested in academics as Lolita. And while Prager's Lolita, Lucky Linderhoof, manages to prove to us that Lolita had much more personality and perspective than Nabokov ever gave to her, while still communicating the tragedy of young girls who are victims to sexual violence, Pera's Lolita takes on a deranged, seductive, and cruel demeanor that switches her from the role of victim to one of the pursuer. I found this change alarming and ridiculous. How many 12-year-olds pursue middle-aged men, especially with full knowledge of the implications of where those actions might lead? How many twelve-year-olds does Pera know? I think that it may have been since she was that age herself that she talked with any preteens.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, Lo's Diary does have a few noticeable strengths. Pera describes Lolita's arguments with a creativity and finesse that reminisces of Nabokov's nuances and attention to detail. I completely buy these dramatic and petty fights. The particular instances she describes are convincing enough they could be in the original book, but they are not. And some of her writing, while too complex for her narrator to pull off, is really beautiful. I think Pera's biggest mistake was keeping too much of her novel the same as the original novel, and making bizarre and disturbing changes, where Lolita's folly deserved a little more respect. Prager's story works because she tells it in a modern setting, and gives the precocious Lolita a sharp brain that allows us to imagine she might have the intelligence to tell us what happened to her in an interesting way. And while Prager's Lolita has her revenge, she is still deeply impacted by Humbert's abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do agree with both authors' insistence that Lolita's story be told from her own perspective. I guess it is just the matter of what Lolita's voice would sound like that is called into question here. In my opinion, it would sound much more like the brilliant and zany Lucky Linderhoof of Roger Fishbite, than the vulgar animal torturer from Lo's Diary.\n",

      "Michael Smerconish has made a national name for himself through the radio and television, and now he's offered up the written word with the novel, \"Talk.\" We live in a cynical age that would give Jefferson Smith nightmares, but even by today's standards \"Talk\" focuses on the seedy side of modern American politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our hero is Stan Powers (real name, Stanislaw Pawlawsky), political yakker along Florida's I-4 corridor. Stan is as surprised as anyone that he talks about politics for a living as he grew up a stoner more interested in a rock album's liner notes than any politician's speeches. But he learned an interesting lesson after working as a radio DJ spinning tunes - there's little difference between a classic rock DJ and a conseravative political talk show host - you just have to keep the hits coming. But instead of playing classic songs like \"Walk This Way\" or \"Misty Mountain Hop,\" you reiterate extreme rhetoric about the Second Amendment or how President Obama is a Kenyan terrorist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smerconish pulls back the curtain on talk radio's complex web of advisers, players, and talent as Powers unexpectedly moves up the food chain, more or less through blind luck masquerading as fate. It's the next presidential campaign, and the Florida governor is the favorite for the Demoratic Party nomination . . . and whose gorgeous wife just happens to be the summertime fling who encouraged Powers to go into radio in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, political winds being what they are, the I-4 corridor of Florida turns out to be the most critical swing district in the state, so all the Republican party nominees are desperate to win over Powers and his flock of listeners, and they are willing to go to great lengths to win his loyalty . . . or to use him to further their own ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "What ensues is a morality tale of selling out, of how to throw your integrity to the wind while trumpeting \"American values\" and defending our \"founding Judeo-Christian principles.\" It's a breezy read - at least than 280 pages, you might finish the book on one cross-country flight as Smerconish keeps the action quick and the analysis light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smerconish creates a fine scenario and his political creatures are all recognizable and enjoyable, even if they are shallow one-note creations. The weakest part of the novel is actually our hero, Stan Powers. True, the guy was never all that ambitious and at times he reads just like the slacker he was as a young man, but throughout the story he is one passive dude, blithely accepting his good fortune and bobbing along in the political current . . . but his acceptance of the path of least resistance and his resolution of the book's culminating event - whether to unleash a scandalous half-truth that will rock the presidential election - ring false.\n",
      "\n",
      "Others may not be so bothered by the ending, but for me it was as unsatisfying as the 45-second speech Michael Douglas gives at the end of \"The American President\" - was that all it took to make Bob Rumson go away? I won't spoil this ending for you, but I will leave it to you to analyze whether you think Powers' efforts resolve the mess he helped create.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, a cynical, clever, but not-too-funny take on our modern political world. This is a must-read for political junkies, although I would imagine that it's more for the MSNBC crowd (which includes me) than Fox.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I started listening to Michael Smerconish in the summer of 2000 trying to get my brain wrapped around the upcoming election. He's a super entertaining talk show host who could address serious political issues just as well as he could discuss lifestyle points like if Christmas lights should be white or multicolored. As his career progressed his time slot changed and my listening interests shifted more to podcasts than political radio but I was always glad when he succeed and got a more national recognition and a spot on CNN. Anyway, this is all to explain why I bought his novel when it came out (to support a person I felt like I \"knew\") but never actually read it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This week I stumbled upon his novel in my kindle and it felt like the time to read it. OMG. It's a scathing expose of the media/talk radio/cable TV. It's not the most well written thing (there's a lot of redundancy) but he creates a great (if overly crude) character in Stan Powers, talk show host on the rise, and a plot that seems shockingly plausible. Because I have followed so much of his career I recognize a lot of Michael in his character and I wonder how much truth hides in the rest of this story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the plot, there are several passages describing the state of American politics and the role of media in it and for that alone I think this is a good read for this period leading up to the fall election.\n",

It made me think twice about the sports talk show I listen to daily. The protagonist (Stan) almost has a Bukowski vibe to him. I probably would of rated this a 4 until I read the last chapter. The ending put a smile on my face. I'm really glad I won this.\n",

      "The first half of this book was terrific and I was loving it. I thought the portrayals were accurate as I had no problem picturing Matt Smith and Jenna Coleman. I loved the concept of an sentient being feeding on the grief of the world because of a tragic event. For the first half of this book I could not fathom why there were so many negative reviews. Then the second half hit me and I soon found my answer. This book took an awful, silly (which is saying something considering this is a book and this universe is not known for its seriousness) turn and it completely ruined this novel. Clowns, really? We went from a tragic moment in history to clowns. This was wrong on so many levels.\n",

Unfortunately, it took a one hundred and eighty degree turn and I recommend avoiding this book.\n",

      "Shroud of Sorrow (Doctor Who: New Series Adventures #51) by Tommy Donbavand was a solid story, but not one of the best stories. It starts off well, but it could quite maintain it throughout. The author did a good job capturing the tone of the Eleventh Doctor yet I didn't quite see that with Clara in comparison. My favorite aspect were easily all of the call backs, especially Astrid Peth. I really liked her.\n",

      "A little, but quite beautiful book. It’s a collection of Native American proverbs. I’ve read quite a few of these books of proverbs, and the thing what I find most interesting about them now is the we really are all the same, what ever the culture is called. For example:\n",

      "We should be as water, which is lower than all things yet stronger even than the rocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "This really sounds like something straight out of Zen Buddhism, but it comes from Oglala Sioux.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest different between Native American proverbs, and others, seems to be in the view of nature, like in this one that comes from Arapaho: Take only what you need and leave the land as you found it.\n",

      "This is another of my \"keep it out\" books. I am admittedly a lover of quotes, recognizing any moment in my life where I may have thought I \"knew it all\" was a foolish moment indeed. I've a great appreciation for Native American wisdom and these proverbs offer limitless proverbial pondering opportunities. \"The only things that need the protection of men are the things of men, not the things of spirit.\" (CROW)\n",

      "This tiny book I found in the Visitor Centre of Jackson, Wyoming. It is really interesting to find proverbs from other cultures, but also see how folk have responded to proverbs from my culture. For example, “if a man is as wise as a serpent, he can be as gentle as a dove” which is clearly a response to the Christian “be as wise as serpents and as gentle as doves”. Clearly some folk on meeting the First Nation people didn’t quite live up to the message they proclaimed.\n",
      "There is much wisdom here, much respecting the old, living wisely, understanding how people best get along, and be a person who “strives to be never absent from an important act” so that “they are not dead who live in the hearts they leave behind.”\n",

      "All major groups of humans have a collection of proverbs, some of the wise sayings are thousands of years old. For example, Aesop’s fables are thought to be over 2,500 years old. It is likely that many or most of the proverbs in this collection are that old, verbally passed down from generation to generation.\n",
      "Many of them reflect the Native American reverence for the land and nature, attempting to coexist with the world rather than conquer and subjugate it. While the sayings are good, they do not capture an essential component of the Native Americans, the fact that tribes waged war on each other. For example, some of the proverbs on the back cover are:\n",

      "“Why will you take by force what you may obtain by love?”\n",

      "\n",
      "Students of history know that one of the reasons the white man was so successful against the Native Americans is that various tribes had centuries of history of warfare against each other. In that respect, this book is misleading.\n",

      "“Please don’t ever get anxious or worry about me, but don’t forget to pray for me – I’m sure you don’t. I am so sure of God’s guiding hand that I hope I shall always be kept in that certainty. You must never doubt that I’m traveling with gratitude and cheerfulness along the road where I’m being led. My past life is brim-full of God’s goodness and my sins are covered by the forgiving love of Christ crucified.”\n",

      "One of my favorite research papers to write was one on Christian German resistance during World War II. While I could go on for days discussing it (which I’m sure you find shocking), I’ll just stick to one of the main players from that: Dietrich Bonhoeffer. He was arrested and later executed (23 days before Berlin was captured by the allies) for the discovery of his connection to anti-Hitler conspiracies (think the movie Valkyrie). Prior to being moved to a concentration camp, he was in prison where he wrote numerous letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Above is from one of them. Incredible. Knowing there was a high possibility he would die at the hands of people who lived by hate, he was about honoring God and forgiveness. As Timothy Keller concluded: “Bonhoeffer uses divine forgiveness to help him understand human forgiveness… As Bonhoeffer says, everyone who forgives someone bears the other’s sins.” So much to take from both of those quotes!\n",

      "Really enjoyed the sections where D talked about the problems of faith in the modern world (now post-modern). The world, according to D, has rejected God as a beginning point for science, philosophy and even theology! Christians are now called to live with Christ in a world that has rejected religion without being religious. In the letters D's ideas were not completely expressed but a lot of interesting thoughts could come out of what he did write. ONe can see where Peter Rollins got a lot of his inspiration for some of his ideas from this volume, i.e. deus ex machina, etc... I would not recommend this book to those who aren't interested in, or ready for, theological issues and perplexities. I like the fact that D could ruminate on the problems of faith, discussing Bultmann, Barth, Kant, and others and yet have a simple, real, trusting faith in Christ. We suffer with Christ in a world that has rejected God. The Christian does not run and hide; but embracing his calling to live in a world without God and suffer with Christ in that world.\n",

      "I finally got around to reading this classic. New editions include many personal letters (which can get tiresome) as well as Bonhoeffer's more theological musings. I'm impressed that he kept such a positive spirit, and thought so deeply in such dire circumstances. Sadly, Bonhoeffer was executed just a few weeks before the war ended.\n",

      "Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor and theologian, was hanged at a Nazi concentration camp in 1945 for his role in the Resistance and in planning a failed 1944 assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler. The version I read is only a selection, as Bonhoeffer’s papers from prison in his Collected Works now run to 800 pages. After some letters to his parents, the largest section here is made up of “Letters to a Friend,” who I take it was the book’s editor, Eberhard Bethge, a seminary student of Bonhoeffer’s and his literary executor as well as his nephew by marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bonhoeffer comes across as steadfast and cheerful. He is grateful for his parents’ care packages, which included his latest philosophy and theology book requests as well as edible treats, and for news of family and acquaintances. To Bethge he expresses concern over the latter’s military service in Italy and delight at his marriage and the birth of a son named Dietrich in his honour. (Among the miscellaneous papers included at the end of this volume are a wedding sermon and thoughts on baptism to tie into those occasions.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Maintaining a vigorous life of the mind sustained Bonhoeffer through his two years in prison. He downplays the physical challenges of his imprisonment, such as poor food and stifling heat during the summer, acknowledging that the mental toll is more difficult. The rhythm of the Church year is a constant support for him. In his first November there he writes that prison life is like Advent: all one can do is wait and hope. I noted many lines about endurance through suffering and striking a balance between defiance and acceptance:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bonhoeffer won over wardens who were happy to smuggle out his letters and papers, most of which have survived apart from a small, late selection that were burned so as not to be incriminating. Any references to the Resistance and the plot to kill Hitler were in code; there are footnotes here to identify them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The additional non-epistolary material – aphorisms, poems and the abovementioned sermons – is a bit harder going. Although there is plenty of theological content in the letters to Bethge, much of it is comprehensible in context and one could always skip the couple of passages where he goes into more depth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading the foreword and some additional information online gave me an even greater appreciation for Bonhoeffer’s bravery. After a lecture tour of the States in 1939, American friends urged him to stay in the country and not return to Germany. He didn’t take that easier path, nor did he allow a prison guard to help him escape. For as often as he states in his letters the hope that he will be reunited with his parents and friends, he must have known what was coming for him as a vocal opponent of the regime, and he faced it courageously. It blows my mind to think that he died at 39 (my age), and left so much written material behind. His posthumous legacy has been immense.\n",

      "\"You must never doubt that I'm traveling with gratitude and cheerfulness along the road where I'm being led.\" -- Dietrich Bonhoeffer, letter from prison, Aug. 23, 1944\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister pointed out how much significant writing comes from people who were incarcerated: The Apostle Paul (several of his epistles), Martin Luther King Jr. (\"Letter from a Birmingham Jail\"). John Bunyan wrote at least the first part of \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" while in jail. I'm sure there are many other examples ... and \"Letters and Papers from Prison\" certainly belongs with the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the \"greatly enlarged\" edition. The original edition limited itself to Bonhoeffer's letters, and only to those that addressed theological concepts. This edition includes many letters written to him, and his letters on more temporal matters. Thus, we not only learn about his theology, we see him living it out. We see him, also, as a plain old human with needs, wants and fears. Several of his early letters to his parents include a request for smoking materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost all of the theology comes in letters written to his friend and in-law Eberhard Bethge (who married Bonhoeffer's niece). This is theology raw, and one suspects it might have been refined a bit before it had been released as a theological work for a larger audience. Some of it is troubling, and some of it I just don't get. But the essence of it, I think, is summed up in a phrase that has become popular: Christianity is not a religion, it's a relationship. Don't misunderstand: Bonhoeffer doesn't use that phrase. But I think it's what he was getting at.\n",
      "\n",
      "This edition may have been expanded a tad too much. I don't think his random notes serve any purpose. I don't think he was a very good poet, but I don't know much about poetry.\n",
      "But what emerges overall is a moving portrait of a man of remarkable humanity, courage and conviction in a time of incredible darkness.\n",

      "when i was younger, i was always confused by the moniker of \"Adult Fantasy\" (less used today, but more common decades ago). i assumed it meant Sexy Sextime and possibly Ultra-Violence, but that was never the case... what it ended up meaning to me was BORING, I Can't Finish This.\n",
      "\n",
      "well now that i am clearly an adult, i get it. for example, Curse of Chalion. this is definitely an Adult Fantasy. it does not feature sex - if anything, it is rather pleasingly old-fashioned and discreet about sex. and it does not feature extreme violence - the violent moments are just that, 'moments', and there is no juvenile dwelling on the pornography of blood, guts, & pain (although there is definitely blood, guts, and pain in our protagonist's life).\n",

      "Curse of Chalion is Adult Fantasy in a few ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "first, it is all about the interior life and the slow-burning changes in a broken man. he is a man in constant turmoil - one who lives in fear due to his tormented past and the betrayals that haunt him, one whose path to be a slow, step-by-step attempt at staying under the radar while looking out for the interests of those he loves. Cazaril is a hero, but not an easy one. action is not his automatic response (and so when it does occur, it is genuinely thrilling). the reader will find little knee-jerk wish fulfillment in his carefully-considered feints & moves. he is one of the most thoughtful protagonists i've come across in Fantasy and a truly Grown Up, Adult Hero.\n",
      "\n",
      "second, the pacing is very deliberate. this is not a novel where action jumps off the page in a big rush. it moves at a conservative pace, bringing the reader along on Cazaril's slow journey. it forces you into understanding what makes the man, why he acts the way he does, before finally picking up the pace and beginning Adventure Time - if you can even call such a thoughtful progression An Adventure. it seems almost purposefully designed to throw off the rather shallow needs of the thrill-seeking reader (and i include myself in that group). the book is .\n",

      "Funny thing: halfway through this book I found myself thinking about what it is that makes Bujold's writing so distinctive in the world of science fiction and fantasy (she's another one of these writers who straddles both worlds), and it suddenly came to me that she was like Jane Austen, interested most of all in people and their relationships in constraint-ridden societies. After finishing the book I glance idly at the \"About the Author\" blurb on the inside back jacket and it says that people often compare her to Jane Austen. So, not an original observation, but more reliable for being an independent duplicate.\n",

      "Also like Jane Austen, her books tend to be fairly similar to one another... even though she writes both science fiction and fantasy. If you like one (as I do), you'll probably like them all... but I wouldn't recommend reading them one after another. The best way to enjoy them is the way one optimizes the enjoyment of a cache of chocolate Easter Eggs: consume them at intervals long enough so that each one seems fresh and new.\n",

      "The first time I read this, I was torn between my respect for Bujold and the slow burning plot of this first fantasy I had ever read by her. It didn't hurt that it was nominated for the Hugo, as she had been nominated over and over, winning several for her classic SF series, but I was like, \"What? Fantasy? But she's so excellent with SF, why switch?\" And then when I started reading it, there were none of the fast-paced elements or larger than life characters that I expected.\n",

      "In fact, other than the fact that Cazaril was a broken man like Miles, he was pretty much Miles's opposite. Steadfast, principled, not attention seeking, reflective, Cazaril is the definition of Loyalty To Another, self-effacing willing to sacrifice himself for a much greater good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house of Chalion is under a curse, after all, and even after Noble Cazaril's capture and having been turned into a slave, his subsequent escape, and reinsertion into his natural household, he's still a conflicted and broken man in body and in spirit. All he really has to hope for is supporting his liege-woman.\n",

      "This is NOT an action fantasy. Indeed, it's nearly spiritual in all the divine revelations. There isn't much magic, but don't worry, the true delight is in the messes that the Five Gods make of the world. The Bastard's death magic is particularly harrowing, and it happens to have the largest role and plot significance in the novel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other fantastically creative part of this novel is it's devotion to characterization. Bujold has always been a master at this, and while this particular novel seems to be a large departure from what we have known, we get through it feeling as if every character is as real as our own loved ones, we handle and are horrified by all the political intrigues and machinations, doing our absolute and not-quite-sufficient best.\n",

      "I feel a lot of sympathetic love for Cazaril and the characters that he loves. Being broken is not the end. It's difficult and painful and horrible, but even in his darkest despair, he still managed to keep being wise, even in his (several) self-sacrifices?\n",

      "There is an interesting mix of characters, somewhat archetypical but done well enough that they developed uniqueness. A feudal system, a failing monarch, an unscrupulous chancellor, a strong-minded but elderly female ruler, young heirs running wild, but all with twists that give them individuality. I do appreciate the hero, Cazaril, being developed more along an anti-hero line. Not because he is ethically questionable--far from it--but because he is a physical wreck. As he regains his footing, he undergoes some spiritual challenges as well. Bujold thankfully avoids the traps of failing to have critical information shared between characters, so while Caz undergoes spiritual struggles, he discovers people to help him find his path. I also greatly appreciated Iselle, the young female royal being developed and individualized into a well-rounded, thoughtful person, almost the exact opposite of her brother.\n",

      "There are a few fantastical elements that are well placed, making it an epic fantasy filled with divine miracles more than magical ones. I enjoyed the assured way Bujold handles language and development, and appreciated the balance between reflection and action. If the plot wasn't altogether a surprise, it was well done, and a pleasant journey along the way.\n",

      "It was very well written, which is what I have come to expect from this author. It definitely gave me a feeling for how people lived in that era. I wish I could give it 3.5 stars, though. Perhaps because of the format, I felt there was a certain sameness to each of the stories. I think there is a possibility that Let The Hurricane Roar was her masterpiece.\n",

      "Lane really, really didn't like the small town America in which she was raised, and in particular she didn't like the lifestyle it forced upon the women living it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first chapter is a beautifully written indictment of the nameless Midwestern town in which the story is set. Parochial, insular, stuffy, middle-brow, Wilder's old home town is obsessed with what is proper and especially what isn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the chapters are stories told by a young girl named Ernestine about other women who live there, and most of them are pretty easily identifiable as wish fulfillment on the part of the author. The old maid escaping seduction by town ne'er-do-well by her own pluck and the timely appearance of a new suitor. The hired girl forced by gossip to marry the husband when the wife dies, which ends about as well as you might expect. A wife who leaves her husband and goes on to become a couturier. The selfish old woman who lies about her daughter being fast to her daughter's suitor so he'll jilt her and she'll have someone at home to take care of her. Ernestine's \"fast friend\" Elsie falls for a traveling man with disastrous results. The town beauty elopes with a hayseed, and a mother sells her beautiful daughter to the highest bidder, with homicidal results.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last chapter, Ernestine has finally had enough (and so have we) and against the wishes of her parents leaves home for school in NYC. You don't so much as cheer as think, \"What took you so long?\"\n",

      "This was a reread and I have to say it was just as enjoyable the second time around. I have learned a little about Rose Wilder Lane and I can say that I wasn't surprised by her acerbic style of writing. She is every bit as good a writer as her mother, but my, what a different attitude toward small town life!!!\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A fun historical read, but even more so if you are a fan of the Little House books by Rose's mother, Laura Ingalls Wilder. Rose wrote this book before her mother wrote (and Rose heavily edited) the Little House books, so although the book is written about the turn of the century and the styles are more \"Gibson Girl\" the description of daily life is reminiscent of the Little House books. It also reminds me of the era depicted in \"The Music Man\" -- we even have the traveling salesman offering sen-sen to young girls (naughty!)\n",
      "\n",
      "The author says she wrote the book to give modern readers at the time (the 1930s) an idea of what life was like \"before the war.\" (World War I) She manages to convey a sense of irreverence and rebellion in the main character Ernestine, and her views on the absurdity of some of the old restrictions are clear. The girls and women manage to rebel as best they can within the strict conventions of society, and in some cases we get a glimpse of their lives \"after the war\" when they are able to travel and have professions.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a period piece it is excellent, and if you're interested (as I am) in references to styles and fabrics (dimity, calico, nun's veiling)-- or the quaint reference to \"machine lace\" curtains, there is a treasure trove of information and nostalgia. And although the heroine, Ernestine, is sheltered by her parents and the strict customs of the town, the stories don't shy away from drama, death, and even cruelty at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having read \"Ghost in the Little House\" (the story of Rose Wilder Lane's life) I know that she herself left home at a young age and lived a very modern life for a woman of her era. It's interesting to know that later in her life (much later than the writing of this book) she wrote that the world had stopped making sense to her around 1914 (WWI). So although she rebelled, the world made sense when she knew what to rebel against -- small town life as depicted in this book.\n",

      "Really enjoyed this one, as a good read in and of itself, as well as a good look into Rose's life and impressions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is chick-lit and a period piece, really a gift from another time that is still relatable. It's fascinating to see what was and was not considered proper behavior for a young lady around the turn of the century in rural middle America.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as we learn these cultural nuances, we also observe the many ways people manipulate their social situations in the struggle to get what they want out of life. In this way, human nature doesn't change much over time and through the generations. We outwardly adapt to conform, but search for ways to maximize our options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lots of fun, nothing much like the Little House books but a must read for their fans anyway to see our Wilder ladies' thinly veiled lives from another angle. So grateful the publisher dusted off this long out-of-print treasure. Have read and re-read at least ten times and not done yet.\n",

      "The best Cthulhu Now (1990s) thing I've read so far, this campaign actually involves things that connect it to the 1990s and doesn't just feel like a slightly off 1920s scenario. It still features a bit too much of the \"Mythos hoedown\" thing I don't love, where too many different factions, critters & alien beings are wrapped up in things. I'm generally of the opinion that less is more when it comes to Mythos elements in a scenario or campaign. One cult (unless the story's central idea is an inter-cult conflict), one Elder God, or one alien species, etc. Mixing too many dilutes things and starts making it feel like a Dungeons & Dragons game. Still, there's a lot of potential. I think it would work best if a keeper were to mix the events into an ongoing game, mixing in a few additional, connected scenarios into the mix. I felt like there was maybe too much happening for the length of the campaign, but maybe fleshing out each individual element might make the whole better.\n",
      "Cthulhu Now isn't generally my thing and this one doesn't win me over. Yet, I think this one has a lot of potential. I think it would also make good fodder for a Delta Green game. If I were to ever use it, that's what I'd do.\n",

      "While \"The Giver\" was written years ago, I did not discover it until this year. So lucky me, I got to read all four books in the series quite close together (although not directly back-to-back). Although unlike other series, the four books didn't weren't technically sequels/serials (each book picking up where the last left off) ... in fact, it was a bit of a stretch to tie the books to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Book 1: The Giver: I really liked this story. The reader is introduced to a pretty \"perfect\" society... a Utopia one would think. Perfect families (one boy one girl in each), perfect professions for all, no sickness, no old age, no turmoil ... no OTHER things too (color, music, mountains). Despite some implausibility, it was an enjoyable and introspective read. I would mention aspects of it to my boys, wondering if it might stir their interest at all. It was pretty easy/short, and had a young boy as the protagonist. It is considered a YA book, yet I think I appreciated it much more as an adult that I would have as a teenager. Content: There is some talk of \"stirrings\" (sexual thoughts) which are immediately supressed with pills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Book 2: Gathering Blue: Do NOT consider this a SEQUEL to \"The Giver\" or you will be disappointed. You could read this on its own, not having heard of \"The Giver\" at all. It is a completely different story, in a completely different setting, completely different characters. That said, it again was a very interesting story. This time with a female protagonist, and the setting cannot be considered Utopian in any way. I wasn't quite satisfied with the ending (while \"The Giver\" was completely open ended, this one seemed MORE abrupt, without closure.)\n",

      "Book 3: The Messenger: What I liked about this book, is that it tied Book1 and Book2 together. It was very satisfiying to have both stories entertwine. But overall ... I can't say that I LIKED this book. It left me sad, disturbed ... it was very thought provoking. I'm not saying it was bad, I'm just saying it wasn't an enjoyable read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Book 4: Son: This book tied all THREE books together. To start, the reader is BACK in the world of \"The Giver\" ... at the same time, same characters, just a different point of view. It was really interesting to see some of the same scenes through different eyes. I really liked the first portion of the book. The second section dragged a little, and the third section brought everything from the first three books together. It felt a little too easy at the end, everything coming together, but I left the book (and the series) on a very positive note, happy with how (almost) everything turned out.\n",

      "I saw the movie and I know the book is always better. I enjoyed the movie, but it left me wondering what happened next. I am glad I didn't buy just the book \"the Giver\" because it is exactly like the movie and it leaves you wondering what happened too. But this book tells 4 different stories and gives you the whole story. I could see similarities in the story to how our lives and the way we live could cause misguided leaders to think all the problems in the world could be solved if only we did \"this\" or \"that\" differently. But a perfect world doesn't exist and would not make us happy anyway. Those who legislate and try to control only cause more problems and we need to fight to protect our quality of life. Evil will always exist in some form or another and true happiness is when we help and support each other and use our God given gifts to make the world a better place. I could not put this book down!\n",

      "I quite enjoyed the simplicity of this book. Each book told of a different story from someone else's point of view, yet in the end they are all connected together and brought together the story through different perspectives. The main moral of the story explains how our lives and the way we live can sometimes be the outcome of how some misguided leaders think problems in the world should be solved or eliminated, though there is no such thing as a perfect world, and even if there was, it wouldn’t necessarily make us any happier. Those misguided leaders who try to control and change the world mostly end up causing more problems that we need to fight against to protect the meaning of our lives. Evil is always lurking near by and can only be overcome through happiness, which is accomplished when we help and support one another, and use our gifts to make the world a better place.\n",

      "This is a collection of different short stories that cover different time periods and and different characters from this universe. We get to see Ender's dad in a couple of these stories and it ends with the original short story of Ender's Game that was eventually made into the famous novel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a fan of background information and world building in the many different universes that I read. Unfortunately this one was not that great. The first story was the best one as this cover Ender's grandparents and their time back in their home country. They do not conform to the child limitation decree and I liked this look into that as it has ties to the real world. I thought all the other stories fell short. The second story was the meeting of Ender's mom and dad. I was actually liking this story but it just ended out of nowhere. It was such an abrupt ending I actually thought I fast forwarded on the audiobook. Then we spend time on the story that started it all. The problem with this is that chances are that you most likely already read the novel that came from this short story. So basically this was a retread of stuff I already knew and it is the definition of not adding anything to the lore. It was a waste of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wasn't really expecting much from this side piece. That being said I was expecting a little more than it offered. The term cash grab is used often when describing side pieces and this is a good example of a cash grab. It really doesn't add much to the universe. With its terrible decision to stop stories when they should not be ending or a retread of stories that have been most likely read I would say pass on this side piece and concentrate on the novels of this universe.\n",

      "I loved reading the background stories to Ender's Parents, but was sad when their story stopped so abruptly. They barely have one good day together, and it's like Paul Harvey steps in with his famous tag line, \"and now you know the rest of the story\". I wanted more, and felt robbed. Then the story quickly jumps (no transition) to a portion that seemed to have come straight out of Ender's Game, only there were discrepancies. There's a discrepancy with Graff's character and his age(within this book, not even considering the other stories), and also with who was in his \"jeesh\" for the final battle. The next story that's told is of Jane's existence. I enjoyed readying the background story for her and Ender, but when finished I simply wanted more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stories were well written, but had I not been familiar with the Ender Universe, I wouldn't have had the slightest idea what was going on at the start of the short story Ender's Game in the book. I expected First Meetings to be a fun stand alone story about Ender's parents, somehow fitting in an introduction to Jane. Instead, I read about 70 really fun pages of the parents, then was jumped into Ender's Game for a bit, and then brought into Jane's world for the last part. This book should've been focused on Ender's brilliant parents and their journey to love and parenthood. I would've loved reading about them as young parents of overly bright kids. Jane's story should've been another seperate tale. There's so much depth to that character, 70 or so pages couldn't do her justice.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "When this first came out, I was a little miffed at old Orson for dragging out the highly successful and (to me) hallowed Ender saga for one more flogging, so I refused to read it. However, somehow it wound up in my possession (as book-shaped things are wont to do), and I'm glad I gave in.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've always felt that Card had at least two very interesting and valuable talents: one is creating fleshy, breathy characters (in a good way), and another is having interesting ideas about all sorts of things, usually about politics, history, economics... big-picture stuff about the way things work, the way the pieces of the puzzle fit together and move. Sometimes the two disconnect, as in the more recent books of the Ender series, where I felt that he was much more excited about the ideas than the characters, and just wanted to use my childhood friends as propagandists. The ideas were interesting nonetheless, but I didn't care as much about the people participating in the overarching story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, the two were woven together well in this case, and I really enjoyed it. Especially in \"Teacher's Pest,\" which is an account of Ender's parents' first meeting, I thought the views they espoused fit very nicely with the genius parents of my favorite genius. It's a good read. It made me think, sometimes angrily, and I love that.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book also contains the first version of Ender's Game ever published, in Analog, 1977. It's a fascinating study of the evolution of a story and a writer, coming from this good-but-not-great beginning. The story is virtually the same, but it's so much more heavy-handed... direct references to crucifixion and all that. It gave me a greater appreciation for subtlety, and all of that thick characterization bubbling under the surface.\n",

      "Let me preface this review by saying that Ender's Game is my favorite book and has been for almost 20 years. As such Orson Scott Card is one of my favorite authors, First Meetings, a collection of meetings of primary charters in the Enderverse is a good example of just how good of a writer Card is. Oddly I had thought I had read the book already but when I picked it up I realized it was made up of several short stories, some of which I had yet to read. The book is made up of \"The Polish Boy\", the story of Ender's Father, great story about a character I often felt wasn't flushed out enough before. \"Teacher's Pest\" - by far my favorite in the series, is the story of how Ender's parents met. \"Ender's Game\" the original novella that the landmark book is based on. The Final installment is \"The Investment Counslor\" - the story of how Ender met Jane. Since I read all 208 pages in one sitting I guess I have to rate this book very highly. Its always nice to get to revisit with your favorite worlds and then to find out new things really made for an enjoyable experience\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Ender's Game fascinates me. I always go back and back and back to it. I've heard from many different people, all sci-fi lovers to varying degrees, their opinions on Orson Scott Card's Ender series and the majority of these folks caution me not to waste my time reading further into the series - reportedly the books grow weaker and lean more heavily on the past books.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the thing though - I'm not finding that to be true at all. They're riffing off each other, sure. But that's the best part! I ADORE seeing the same story told from different sides - I ADORE having these people's characters fleshed out more and more. It's vastly interesting to me. I wish everyone wrote this way!\n",
      "\n",
      "This book was passed along to me without a book jacket. I read it blind - no googling to see what it was about or anything. I was REALLY surprised to learn that John Paul - the precocious boy IF wanted in their program was Ender's dad! Reading the little stories without prior knowledge allowed me to be surprised and that was delightful.\n",

      "\n",
      "In a pursuit that has spanned continents, Iolanthe, Titus, and their friends have always managed to remain one step ahead of the forces of Atlantis. But now the Bane, the monstrous tyrant who bestrides the entire mage world, has issued his ultimatum: Titus must hand over Iolanthe, or watch as his entire realm is destroyed in a deadly rampage. Running out of time and options, Iolanthe and Titus must act decisively to deliver a final blow to the Bane, ending his reign of terror for good.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, getting to the Bane means accomplishing the impossible—finding a way to infiltrate his crypt in the deepest recesses of the most ferociously guarded fortress in Atlantis. And everything is only made more difficult when new prophecies come to light, foretelling a doomed effort....\n",
      "\n",
      "Iolanthe and Titus will put their love and their lives on the line. But will it be enough?\n",
      "\n",
      "What I Liked:\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh. My. Goodness! I MUST reread this series as soon as possible. The Burning Sky is one of my favorite books ever, and The Perilous Sea was an amazing sequel. I absolutely loved The Immortal Heights! This series is perfect! Or as close as it gets. Definitely an all-time favorite series!\n",
      "\n",
      "In this thrilling conclusion novel, Iolanthe and Titus must survive horrible tragedies and terrifying prophecies in order to save the realm and rid Atlantis (and the world) of the Bane. Titus will never let the Bane get to Iolanthe, but something must give. Sacrifices must be made. Prophecies must be upheld. Secrets must remain covered - until it's too late.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book was a whirlwind. It didn't start as a whirlwind (see my notes on that below), but it ended with crashes, bangs, and lots of lightning. Sherry Thomas defies expectation - whatever I thought I was in for, I got it, and then some. I have no idea how she crafted such an intricate, exhilarating, creative series! I am quite sure I will not read anything like this, not for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to get into the specifics of the plot, as this is a conclusion novel. The first half is slow, but necessary. Titus and Iolanthe cross continents, climb mountains, scale towers, to fight to defeat the Bane, and for their love. The second half of the book was INTENSE. I think the switch flipped for me when we learn something irreversible about Iolanthe. At that point, I could not turn the pages fast enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, Iolanthe. I love her! This book is told in third person, sometimes Iolanthe, sometimes Titus (but nothing rigid, like alternating). Iolanthe is clever and capable, determined and stubborn. She never backs down, backs away, and always fights for those she loves.\n",
      "\n",
      "TITUS. Titus holds my heart (sorry, Iolanthe). He is so incredibly intelligent, authoritative, polished, talented, fierce, protective. He is the perfect Master of the Domain, prince, friend. He is the one who rules, but he also serves. It's not wonder everyone loves him (except maybe the Bane). Titus is clever and intelligent, always with a plan, backup plan, emergency plan. He has a knack for thinking ahead, and a master strategist. He is also quite the swoony hero. He never tries to control Iolanthe, but he is fiercely protective of her, and does everything he can to keep her - and the world - safe. Titus is easily one of my favorite royals in YA lit, one of my favorite heroes, one of my favorite swoony boys. He is so much more than a love interest - he's a prince first.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love seeing so much of the secondary characters we all love, like Kashkari, his soon-to-be sister-in-law, Amaram even some unexpected faces. I absolutely adore Kashkari, and I felt bad for him throughout the novel. You have to read the series to know why - I feel for him, and wish he finds happiness! If only...\n",
      "\n",
      "The romance in this book (and series) is so satisfying! No love triangle, no breakups/makeups/drama, just a sweet relationship between Titus and Iolanthe. The two of them are so in love, so devoted to each other, it's sweet and tender and sizzly all at once. Props to Sherry Thomas for keeping the romance so simple yet so wonderful. And swoony!\n",
      "\n",
      "As with the first two books, the world-building of this novel is flawless and intriguing. I love the Crucible idea, in which the characters enter a storybook as a means of travel and uncovering secrets. I am totally not explaining this concept well - it is unique and inventive! I could get lost in the world of this series. There are wyverns!\n",
      "\n",
      "The ending of this book is surprising and, like the romance, very satisfying. You'll be worried about certain THINGS throughout this book, but it all comes together in the end. There is plenty of tragedy, but the ending, overall, is very beautiful. I love it! I love this book. Such a fantastic conclusion novel, a great package of series-ending awesomeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I Did Not Like:\n",
      "\n",
      "Like I've said before in this review, the beginning, let's say the first half, was very slow. I was just reading to keep going, see what would happen next. There was absolutely no chance of me DNF-ing this book, that wasn't an issue. It's just that things didn't really pick up until the second half ish, about when we find out something about Iolanthe's future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something that affected me - I could barely remember what happening in The Perilous Sea! I have The Burning Sky practically memorized, but details for The Perilous Sea elude me. This could have been why I struggled with the beginning of this book? Could be just an Alyssa thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would I Recommend It:\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend this conclusion novel, as well as this series! Definitely an all-time favorite series. If you haven't read The Burning Sky, or The Perilous Sea, be sure to fix that as soon as you can. Meanwhile, I am going to be rereading this series. The Burning Sky is still my favorite, but this book and The Perilous Sea are not far behind! Fantasy fans - you NEED this series in your life!\n",
      "\n",
      "Rating:\n",
      "\n",
      "4.5 stars -> rounded down to 4 stars (see my notes above). A stunning conclusion to an epic series! With gorgeous covers, too. And a beautiful romance. And a crazy plot. There are so many reasons why you could fall in love with series as much as I did!\n",

      "I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite series out there. If you haven’t started it yet, what are you waiting for? I’m struggling with my review for just this reason… I can’t really put into words how satisfying this series was for me and the story itself was just everything I look for when reading.\n",

      "Iolanthe and Titus are on a mission to end the Bane’s reign of terror and in order to do so, they eventually have to find a way to get into the deepest parts of his fortress. But along the way, new prophecies will come to light that will alter plans and change lives…\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite part of this story is the evolution of the relationship between Iolanthe and Titus… the way their relationship has progressed through these books has been everything I could have hoped for. The friendship, the banter, the love… *sigh*.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the love is amazing you guys. Thomas writes romance on the regular so she totally knows what she’s doing and she’ll absolutely make you melt and swoon.\n",

      "Thomas keeps this series fast paced with a ton of action and it picks up where The Perilous Sea left off. Iolanthe and Titus and their friends are facing off with the Bane. I know I mentioned above the prophecies … they have played a huge part in this series and it’s no different in this installment. The prophecies are what drive these two forward, but things happen that even I couldn’t have figured out. AND I LOVE THAT!

I hope Sherry Thomas keeps writing for the YA crowd because I for one can’t wait to see what she does next!\n",

      "¡Y llegue al final de esta bella trilogía! 🙌🏻 Cómo leí los tres libros seguidos, tenía toda la información súper fresca, tanto del mundo, los personajes y la famosa profecía.\n",
      "\n",
      "¿Qué me pasó con este libro? Sentí que la autora se apresuro demasiado por terminar la historia. Los hechos pasaron muy rápido y ¡nos da tantos giros! Que uno se termina enredando, todo lo que pensaba haber entendido en las dos primeras entregas, al parecer no era así y ¡era al revés! 🤯. Si bien siempre pasaban cosas, lo cual te mantiene enganchado al libro para saber que pasará a continuación, pero faltaban esos detalles que si existieron en las dos primeros libros. Finalmente, la autora nos introduce a nuevos personajes, lo que no esta mal, pero en este caso no es algo bueno, ya que fue como si aparecieran de la nada; no se narraron mayores explicaciones de cómo llegaron a estar en el final y ser personajes muy relevantes para el desenlace de la historia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lo positivo de todo, es que amé y amo a los protagonistas, Iolanthe y Titus; me encantaban sus diálogos llenos de ironía, con citas pícaras, en donde la protagonista no es víctima sino más bien lleva las riendas en torno a poder cumplir esa profecía. Y por sobre todo, si bien existía el romance no era lo principal para la historia.\n",
      "\n",
      "En cuanto al final, llegó de golpe, después de alrededor de doscientas páginas de detalles; apareció el antagonista y en menos de tres páginas, lo vencieron; así de fácil. Y para llegar al desenlace, sentí que la autora incorporaba cosas nuevas, varias cartas, sueños, objetos mágicos y otras cosas más, que antes no se habían mencionado y que nos llevaban de forma fácil poder llegar a ese final.\n",
      "\n",
      "En fin, lo que me gusto un poco más fue el epílogo, pero no al 100%; si bien era la continuación de lo que había pasado con la vida de los protagonistas, el contexto y la ambientación no me gusto, sumado a que el comienzo fue como muy enredado y, en definitiva, me esperaba otro escenario para ese final. Por tanto, mi puntuación va para los personajes principales, y algunos de los secundarios, con los que llegue a encariñarme.\n",

      "Me gustó. Es un libro muy bien ambientado, tanto en la época, el lugar, como las costumbres; de verdad me sentía en el Viejo Oeste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quedé encantada con los personajes, en especial con la compleja personalidad de Elizabeth, que al haber sido maltratada (o al menos disminuida) por la mayoría de los hombres que la rodearon mientras crecía, no sabe cómo comportarse ante un hombre como Asa. Él, gracias a su carácter y paciencia, derriba todas las defensas de “la indómita Elly” (como es conocida en el pueblo) y logra reconducir su ira e irritabilidad.\n",
      "\n",
      "También me gustó el giro que da la autora para descubrir quién estaba tras los constantes saboteos al rancho, aunque considero que quedaron algunos cabos sueltos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Creo que lo único que no me hace valorarlo mejor, es que se alarga innecesariamente en las escenas íntimas de la pareja, tanto que incluso llegan a cansar un poco. Quizá con algo más de equilibrio entre sexo y el resto del argumento se habría ganado una estrella más.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Was this ever good! The setting was absolutely phenomenal! McCarty writes a western so exceptionally well you'd think she lived during the time and came back to tell everyone about it. And then there’s the sex! Scorcher, scorcher, burns-right-off-the-paper scorcher and ick-free to boot! She has THE best oral sex scene with Elly on the kitchen table that I've ever read! Good god you have to remember to breathe when all is said and done ;)\n",
      "\n",
      "Asa, the hero with the weird name, is soooooo beautiful inside and out. They do not come any better. His “darlin’” this and “darlin’” that just had me swooning right through the book. He is a paragon of hotness this honey is 8)\n",
      "\n",
      "You've got the good guys and the bad guys, a feisty heroine, some really sad stories but none have the sudden problem or misunderstanding that you often know is coming up or just general stupidity that you sometimes get with erotica. There is also no hello-left-field \"filler sex\" which makes the story even better.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the ending! Sigh, sigh, , well my heart skipped a few beats, it was so perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two things I didn’t like about this book was the cheesy cover (which was probably a reason why I wasn’t that eager to read it) and that it weighs 10 tons what with the nicer Ellora’s Cave paper. But that aside, this is one cowboy romance that gets you right at the beginning, has sticky-hot steam and tells a mighty fine love story :)\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "DNF 20% No rating.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the life of me I couldn’t get into this book. For a story set in 1868, the writing style of the characters and the speech felt very modern and unrealistic.\n",
      "And not to mention how sexist this book was sometimes.\n",

      "5 plus stars!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow! This book was amazing. I can’t believe I waited so long to read it! It was everything I could have hoped for. SUPER steamy and erotic (that one scene in the middle nearly killed me, LOL!), but with a deeply satisfying romance you can really sink your teeth into.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plot was well rounded, with just enough mystery to keep things interesting without overshadowing the romance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sex scenes were appropriately placed and with just the right amount of detail (In other words, a LOT!) That Asa sure knows how to get a girl all worked up: slow and easy, taking his sweet time until you’re just about wild with anticipation. Whew!\n",
      "\n",
      "But even better than the way he loved Elizabeth’s body was the way he treasured her heart and soul. I loved how protective and caring he was, and how he shielded her from anything that would cause her physical or emotional harm. Asa is hard as nails, yet soft and tender too. A well-rounded man.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really liked Elizabeth as well. She had spirit and determination, yet there was a vulnerability about her that made her relatable and very real.\n",
      "\n",
      "I only wish I could have gotten more of a happy ending for this couple…an epilogue, maybe. But I hope I’ll get a glimpse of their future in the next 3 books in the series. I was SO excited to see that Cougar will have his love story next. *happy dance!* He certainly deserves it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And let me tip my hat to Sarah McCarty. Nothing irritates me more than having secondary characters monopolize a story. I don’t want to have multiple chapters told in the POV of a secondary character; that’s what their own story is for. I LOVED how Sarah brought in a character such as Cougar and made you love him, while still keeping the focus on Asa and Elizabeth. The entire story is told from either Asa or Elizabeth’s POV, and the secondary characters are there only when they interact with the main couple. Now THAT’S the way to write a series!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I can’t wait to read the rest of this fantastic series!\n",

      "What a piece of ______. This book is $10 for kindle and $18 for paperback, you’d think that there is something to like about it. First don’t buy it because its historical romance. It is modern day illiterate people in 19th century environment. The entire book is terrible. I read the whole thing because I wanted to get to the part that costs $10 to read, well I finished it and that part isn’t there. Second do not buy it because it is listed as erotica, unless u just like crude words, there is no sensuality or any kind of build up, we go from having sex to being shy and not knowing what to do even though we did it 2days ago. Give me a break; it was too frustrating for words. I will list some of the language used as well. I am not sure how the people in the 19th century spoke in the wild west but I highly doubt those words were used, if so my apologies. I am not saying that a book should be accurate but since you market something as historical you have to bring the historical part somewhere.\n",

      "I've listened to audio books of Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer a couple of times as an adult, and they convinced me that Twain was a master of storytelling, especially with respect to revealing personality through dialogue. But this recording voiced by Patrick Fraley is a tour de force. His masterful performance of different dialects for Huck, Jim, the Duke and Dauphin, and more educated characters like doctors and lawyers, brings this classic tale to life better than I have ever heard before. Settle back and enjoy this meditation on the nature of freedom and the contrariness of human nature. Warning: Twain uses a word that was common 180 years ago, but is unacceptable today.\n",

All the main and secondary characters are beautiful, athletic, smart, talented, wealthy, and successful in business and family love. The hero is a jerk but not irredeemably so. Just reading the synopsis already tells he was a bully in 7th grade.\n",

      "Brie Grayson is thirty-three, a successful lawyer with a tendency to be a workaholic, a devoted family member and an all around wonderful person. However, she’s been scorned by love and has decided to never allow herself to be in a situation where her heart can be shattered as it did once before.\n",

      "Maddox Monroe is a highly successful businessman, with a string of luxury hotels scattered across US and Canada. With his business about to go international, he’s agreed to a meeting with the prestigious MMP law firm, never expecting after all these years, to run into his seventh grade crush who he tormented and teased in an effort to hide his infatuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reconnection between Brie and Maddox plays out on the tennis court in a hilarious match that had me in stitches. I simply adored these two right from the start. Their intense attraction was glaringly obvious, no matter how hard they both tried to hide it. Their push-pull, slow progression into romance was a thrill to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "They both have painful pasts they need to overcome. I loved how Maddox might have been reluctant to have more than a sexual relationship with Brie but when he realized there was in fact more to his feelings, he was open to it. It was charming to watch him try and break through Brie’s walls, which she had built high and strong. She, out of the two of them, had the most to grow. She had some major trust issues. But even in the middle of their deepest struggles, I loved their characters and how well they were written.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book opened with an incredible beginning, introducing us to our hero and heroine with dual POV’s. I instantly connected with Brie and I couldn’t help but fall in love with Maddox, even as he was being a little troublemaker and pushing Brie’s buttons. Their interactions were hilarious and fun and I couldn’t help but laugh at their antics and barbs. And when they finally got together, wowza! Hot and sexy!\n",
      "\n",
      "However, about middle way of the book, things slowed considerably. For me, the story began to feel drawn out and prolonged with an info dump on sub or recurring characters and details and character actions that seemed to stray from the main story. Maybe it felt prolonged because I just couldn’t wait to get back to Brie and Maddox and see what happened next. Having not read the first two books in the series, I had no connection with the recurring characters and didn’t care a lot about what was going on in their lives, so that might have been another reason it felt drawn out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last few chapters picked back up with a predictable but well written climax and just enough angsts to pull at your heartstrings and keep you invested to the sweet ending. But for me, after it lost steam, it just never felt the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it was a good read and I enjoyed my time with Brie and Maddox.\n",

      "Mad About the Man (The Graysons #3) by Tracy Anne Warren has a cute setup with a very independent minded, workaholic lawyer heroine who is very dedicated to her job. Her professional and personal life goes into a tailspin when she comes face to face with someone from her past- a former bully of sorts who made her 7th grade year impossible. The former twelve-year-old bully, who actually had a thing for the heroine is a rich CEO who wants to make amends, so to speak. You can just imagine how he wants to do that, which causes the heroine grief because she finds herself very attracted to her former nemesis who now makes her enjoy life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brie is a smart and savvy lawyer who barely has a personal life. She has turned her back on love because she got involved with a co-worker at her old job, who happened to be married and he didn't tell her. Her law firm she has worked at for the past five years or so is trying to grab a new client, some luxury hotel magnate with a lot of money to spend. Brie goes along to seal the deal, and is in for a big surprise because Maddox made her life miserable for a year when she was twelve. Maddox recognizes her right away, and is thrilled she's back in his life. The only way he'll change law firms and lawyers is if Brie is his lawyer. He sweetens the deal by suggesting to her bosses that she makes partner and is given a raise. Brie is annoyed Maddox would use this type of blackmail, but he makes no excuses. She'll try and keep things professional between them, but Maddox is used to getting want he wants. He wants to prove to Brie he's no longer that snot nosed kid she remembers so he can have a shot with her because somehow he knows she's the only woman for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mad About the Man is your typical romance about a rich, handsome CEO hero who tries to take over the heroine's life. But this heroine is no push over. She eventually does cave, but Maddox has to work hard at seducing her. Brie is all work, while Maddox likes to play. She gives in somewhat, but believes her personal relationship has a deadline. Maddox has other ideas. This push and pull between the two was enjoyable to read, and in the end they have some nice chemistry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The downside to Mad About the Man that made me stop from giving it 4 stars and only 3 stars is that there is too much filler in between. A large section of the story is about Brie home with her family. It pulled me out of the story and the connection Maddox tries to build with Brie. Also, there's a soap opera type of jaw dropping shock that made me roll my eyes. It made no sense why this shock and awe road block for Maddox and Brie would be inserted in the plot. It comes out of left field and puts a big damper on the bond and trust Brie develops with Maddox. I also felt the story went on a bit too long, and even though I enjoyed Brie and Maddox's interactions, things would have worked better as a novella.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mad About the Man is okay as contemporary romances go, but it would have worked better without the two big issues I mentioned above.\n",

      "Kitty's review posted at Guilty Pleasures Book Reviews\n",
      "\n",
      "I so was not expecting this story. I loved it – picked it up, started reading it and couldn’t stop until I finished it. Written with exactly what I expect from Tracy Ann Warren, the story was told with just the right amount of laughter, love and lust. She brought the past and present together with style and really made us understand the mind of a pre-teen boy and what lengths he will go to to get the attention of the girl he likes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, even though their lives went in different directions and then brought them back together again, it doesn’t mean that things are going to be any better now that it was in 7th grade for the two of them. Both Brie and Maddox are successful people. Brie an up-and-rising attorney, Maddox a hotel mogul. Apart they are forces of nature but together, there is no stopping them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once Brie-Brie faces her fears, accepts her feelings of lust and puts her big girl Mickey Mouse underwear on, she has to admit that her feelings for Maddox are more than just great sex. They have fun together, they have a lot in common, they enjoy each other’s company. Everything that good relationships are built on. But, she is really having a hard time getting past the fact that\n",
      "he’s a client, his actions in the past and his relentless pursuit of her.\n",
      "Finally giving in, she trusts her instincts to get her out before it’s too late. Then, several things happen that have her reeling, hurt and broken, again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maddox goes after what he wants. When he realizes the woman playing against him in tennis doubles is his middle-school crush, he can’t help but revert to the 12 year old, obnoxious boy that he was. And, seeing her again also makes him see that she could be so much more than hot sex. Decisions have to be made that with either make or break what he has with Brie. He could only hope that she’ll understand, that she will forgive him, that she’ll eventually come back to him. He’ll wait for her, do whatever he has to, if her just being his attorney is all that she will give him …. he’ll take it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deception tore them apart … devastation brings them back together again.\n",
      "I loved Brie’s story. It brought out every emotion that I had. I laughed at their antics when they were young; I was excited when they finally got together; I was mortified when the truth came out; I cried right with the rest of the Grayson’s at the cemetery; then danced with Elvis in Las Vegas.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, what I loved the most was how the story was told. It was fluid, written with style and flair. Tracy Ann Warren brings out the best in each of her characters. She makes us feel a part of their life and never makes us feel like a voyeur … she draws us in with their laughter and tears, makes us love them and then gives us what really want and crave – a beautiful happily-ever-after.\n",

      "It's that time of year again: I'm at my parents', I've run out of books, and I'm going through a relative's attic library.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is a fairly typical historical romance novel, complete with BIG MISUNDERSTANDINGs, DEVASTATING TWISTS, and LACK OF COMMUNICATION. The big unique thing in this book is supposed to be that instead of a charming, womanizing rogue, the hero is a somewhat deformed, ugly man with no self-esteem around women. There are two problems with this:\n",
      "1. This is not terribly unique if you know the stories of the Phantom of the Opera, or, say, I don't know...Beauty and the Beast?\n",
      "2. The man's terrible, self-esteem ruining deformity is.....he's a ginger. No, I'm not kidding. He's a red head with a broken nose or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a completely average and trite romance novel with little to make it stand out amongst other trite and average romance novels. Also, I did notice that the author apparently did little enough research to not know who the King of England was during 1365 so it was always \"the king wishes\" \"the king the king.\" (It was Edward III, for the record)\n",

      "2 Estrellas, y va que chuta, porque vaya ganas de estropear una historia que tenía buenos ingredientes, buenos personajes y un trasfondo que prometía.\n",
      "\n",
      "¿Qué ha sido de \"La Bella de la Bestia\"? La verdad es que sólo el título, porque si la intención es que esta novela se pareciera al mítico cuento la lectora se llevará un chasco de narices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Como digo, al principio prometía. Un hombre, un guerrero de gran renombre, valor y reputación, que tiene la desgracia de no ser físicamente agradable, si no que se lo definiría como alguien feo; y una mujer muy hermosa, paciente y bondadosa y capaz de ver mucho más allá de lo que el simple físico del hombre aparenta.\n",

      "Debido a las circunstancias que se mencionan en la sinopsis, Thayer y Gytha están obligados a casarse, él por ser el heredero de la Casa Saitun, y ella como heredera para unir sus casas. Hasta la boda, el libro iba como la seda y hasta me estaba gustando. Después la historia se ha convertido en un rollo sin sentido, incoherente e inverosímil.\n",
      "\n",
      "El gran problema que le he visto a la novela es ése, inverosímil. Situaciones forzadas, personajes de chiste. Estamos ante un libro en el que los buenos son muy buenos, y los malos muy malos, y encima de ser malos, son estúpidos y absurdos. ¡Tienes a una persona persiguiéndote durante medio libro con la intención de darte muerte y llevarse a tu esposa, y lo sabes y no haces nada! Tienes pruebas de semejante tropelía ¿Y no lo llevas ante el rey? Pues sí, el malo de esta historia es una cosa asquerosa e ilógica que en manos de otra escritora no habr��a durado ni un capítulo, pero aquí tenemos un resumen de cómo no hacer historias chapuceras, porque este es el resultado.\n",
      "\n",
      "Por otro lado el romance de los protagonistas, sí, empezó muy bien, pero igualmente su historia se vuelve tan incomprensible que no sabes por donde pillarla. De todas formas, he empatizado mucho más con Gytha a este respecto y lo que siente por Thayer, y hasta he aplaudido más de una de sus decisiones, pero Thayer, que debería haber reblandecido corazones, me ha sabido a poco. Thayer es un personaje al que su físico le ha acomplejado siempre, y sobrevivió a una traición espantosa, amó a una mujer que se aprovechó de él y lo pisoteó. Por ello a Thayer le cuesta mucho confiar en las mujeres, sobre todo en las mujeres nobles y hermosas, y no se lo pondrá nada fácil a Gytha, por mucho que le atraiga su joven esposa. Pronto su romance de ahora te quiero, ahora te odio, estará lleno de vaivenes, confusiones, rencor, y desconfianza, así que el gran problema que aquí se nos presenta es una falta de comunicación abismal.\n",
      "\n",
      "A pesar de ello, la escritora lo ha intentado arreglar al final, pero para mi gusto ha alargado demasiado la historia, y la idea general de la novela se podía haber resuelto mucho antes. De modo que sólo salvo el inicio del libro (hasta la boda), y las diez últimas páginas, pero aún así es un libro que no recomiendo a menos que tengas muchas ganas de leerlo, y atente a las consecuencias.\n",

I fear your poor father knows very little. If I handled a sword as I do women, I should have been killed in my first battle.” He smiled faintly when Bek giggled. “Second—few men are true masters over their women. In truth, I would eye with suspicion any woman who acts as if that is the truth. Either she lies, or she is so dull-witted or weak-spirited that she will make you a tedious wife.”\n",

      "Thayer thought he was about to attend his cousin William's wedding & soon discovers he is the bridegroom of the beautiful Gytha (ugh, what a name) due to a twist of fate. Thayer is appalled at this news. Years earlier his heart was broken by a beautiful but heartless well-bred woman and he promised himself he would never become that vulnerable again. Gytha slowly breaks through the barriers he's constructed around his heart with her innocence and loving ways. But deep down Thayer still isn't convinced she is as pure as she seems and dreads the day when he will find her in bed with another man. Because of Thayer's mistrust, a greedy uncle and Thayer's ex-love Elizabeth (who decides she wants him back in her bed) he and Gytha have a very rocky road ahead of them.\n",

It was refreshing to read about a heroine who had no care for looks and although she was physically perfect she didn't feel it was an important part of who she was. This book was very funny in part while still being emotionally intense and the chemistry between the h/h was smoldering. This one teared me up & had me smiling at the same time. I hated to see their story come to an end. Definitely one worth pulling out of the tbr pile.\n",

      "If I was rating this book personally, I'd give it 5 but objectively, as a rating used for recommendation, it's a four.\n",
      "\n",
      "So firstly I'll start with why I'm giving it a four. Then I'll write why, for me, it's a 5. This book is a great resource, absolutely filled with information, the majority of it accurate. It lists full summaries of every single young adult and adult Star Wars novel in Chronological order and is very thorough. Many have criticized this book saying all this information can be found on Wookieepedia... And yet, it cannot. I can't tell you how many times I have been frustrated by not being able to find FULL story summaries for certain books but even Wookieepedia doesn't provide the detail or the fullness of summaries that this does. However, as some have said, it is summaries only and therefore isn't a very interesting or exciting read for anyone who knows their stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for me, this was exactly what I wanted because let's face it, while I there are gems in the EU, there is a LOT of rubbish too. Unfortunately, to read some of the good ones, you need to know what happened in the bad ones. Here's what I mean:\n",
      "\n",
      "The first EU books I read were the Thrawn Trilogy and after finishing, I really wanted to read his follow-ups The Hand of Thrawn duology. But there were so many books around and between. And Hand of Thrawn references the XWing Rogue Squadron, Jedi Academy Trilogy, Callista Books and Dark Empire comic series HEAVILY. But oh boy, those books are HORRIBLE. Rogue Squadron is trash, Jedi Academy I could only do 1.5 of the three books before I threw them out, the Dark Empire comics I didn't read and the Callista Books have such low ratings I didn't even bother. So when I read Timothy Zahns Hand of Thrawn books, many major plot elements left me feeling a little lost. I still loved them and it was easy enough to figure it out having read Rogue Squadron 1 and some of the Jedi Academy Trilogy. But I still felt I was missing out on a lot of important back-story.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's where this book comes in. With this, you can read Thrawn Trilogy, read one page summaries of all the nonsense between, then pick up Hand of Thrawn and understand what's going on without the pain of reading all of it. This can be used really for any period in the EU to be able to read from anywhere you want and still be able to fill in the gaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is a must for someone who wants to read all the better books or simply the books that appeal to them, while still having knowledge of what happened in the rubbish ones that they may not have an interest in reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Word of advice though, these summaries are FULL, so if you don't want to know the endings to certain books, don't read the summaries in here.\n",

However the day to day life on a ship varies very little, eat, sleep, work for most of the day and at the end of the day you go to your assigned rack, with nothing to do.\n",

      "Near the end of the 11 month deployment I had finished every adult Star wars novel currently published, and read the summaries of all the young adult and comic exclusive stories. I, at one point, knew everything there was to know about major plot lines in the EU thanks to this book.\n",
      "Inside there is a detailed summary of each individual story, with main characters and locations, all placed in chronological order, with beautiful full color artwork and inclusions from the various authors.\n",
      "This book is great if want you want is a complete understanding of the EU, worth every penny.\n",
      "Review 3\n",

      "This book was fascinating. Containing a summary of every adult novel plus juvie novels like Last of the Jedi, Jedi Apprentice and Young Jedi Knights among others, it provided a chronological place for every story. It advised readers on which books to read first when more then one occured at the same time. It also fit short story collections such as Tales of Jabba’s Palace (and similar books), as well as the short stories included in magazines into the timeline. The book also provided character insights and discussed continuity issues. A book I would highly recommend.\n",

      "The Essential Reader's Companion takes readers through an in-universe chronological (as opposed to release date chronology) list of all the Star Wars novels and ebooks published at date of publication. Each book gets some general information (author, timeline placement, cast list, worlds visited, where to find it), a story summary and sometimes some behind the scenes info. Each era gets a page of character portraits and there are images of various scenes scattered throughout. On top of this, there are sidebars that highlight important comics short stories that fit into the narrative. It doesn't quite have all of the Legends universe (as it was published in 2012 and Legends mostly ended in 2014). That said, it's mostly complete. A great reference guide for those who want to read everything, those who have read everything, and those who don't have time to read everything but want a good overview of everything. A must for any Star Wars fan who wants to get the most out the novels.\n",

      "Avec les films de Star Wars qui recommence a paraître au grand écran, ça donne envie de recommencer a lire sur le sujet. Je me suis donc procurer plusieurs encyclopédies, livre de background et d'histoire (comme le cours) de Star Wars. Comme ce sont des ouvrages de références, il est difficile de dire que j'aurai lu chaque ligne et chaque page de chaque livre. Mais après l'avoir feuilleté page par page je pourrai au moins dire si l'oeuvre vaut le prix payé et si je la recommande a d'autres fans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Donc le premier livre de référence de Star Wars que j'ai choisi de consulter page par pages c'est le guide essentiel de la lecture. Il contient tous les roman, mini-histoires et nouvelles écrite pour cet univers. Assez impressionnant on a la liste des personnages principaux, un résumé, les planètes visité qui sont lié a l'atlas Star Wars et on a même des vignettes sur les multiples bandes dessinées ou jeux vidéos qui ont influencer le myth de Star Wars.\n",
      "\n",
      "La présentation est vaiment top notch et les résumé ne spoil pas tant l'histoire, autre que dire ce qui se passe, on ne sait pas comment sa s'est passé. Donc il est possible de lire sans trop se gâcher la lecture des romans. Un outils essentiel pour un fan qui voudrait lire a nouveau du vieux star wars et savoir quels livres cherché. Surtout qu'ils sont maintenant pas mal tous en version numérique.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petit bonus, les résumer pourraient même donner du jus pour un Gamemaster de faire des aventure de RPG de Star Wars et utiliser les résumer comme des synopsis d'aventure. Avec la liste des personnages (qui ensuite se trouve facilement sur Wookieepedia), l'atlas et le résumé c'est un jeu d'enfant d'en faire sa propre aventure. Donc une source incroyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bon maintenant la raison du 4 étoiles, qui est en fait un 4.5 étoiles (goodreads devraient permettre de coté a demi). C'est que toute une saga entière de star wars a été carrément oublier ou laisser de côté de manière volontaire. Je parle ici de Star Wars: Legacy qui se passe 130 ans après la battaille de Yavin. Je demande pas un chapitre complet, mais au moins une vignette qui résume et dit qu'elles personnages il y a dedans. L'auteur parle de Darth Krayth qui est le Sith de cette série mais il ne nous dit pas a qu'elle histoire même dans quelle saga il va fitter. C'est vraiment la seul saga et peut-etre celle de Kaan qui n'ont pas été traité dans le livre. Shit 2 page de vignette de plus aurait pas fait planté la presse. L'auteur est capable de faire sortir toutes les histoire même a 500 mots, mais pas capable de sortir 2 des plus gros comics du lots. Ça m'a un peu déçu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sinon, un autre point que j'aurais aimé, mais je comprend pourquoi ce n'est pas là, c'est une cote sur 5 sur comment le livre est fidèle à l'univers ou du moins la récception générale du roman. Mais comme je dis je comprend pourquoi ce n'est pas là, j'ai juste a chercher chaque livre individuellement sur Goodreads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Donc, maintenant que presque tous ces romans son rendu inexistant a cause du nouveau film, c'est vraiment le temps idéal de se procurer ce livre. Si un jour ils font une autre édition de ce livre, je crois qu'il se concentrera seulement sur le canon de Star Wars, donc ne contiendra pas la moitié des livres et histoire de ce livre. Ce livre est un ouvrage de référence très impressionnant qui a juste omis une des saga les plus intéressantes avec Star Wars: Legacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hautement recommandé pour tout fans qui veut savoir ce qui existe comme histoire de star wars et qui veut avoir la chance d'au moins lire le résumé.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "stupid fucking humans, you are the worst! always getting shit wrong and not caring!\n",
      "\n",
      "John Scalzi sort of agrees but sort of doesn't. he's a humanist who loves the individual as well as a scornful critic who slams systems, systematized secrecy, imperialism, and the use of conflict as a way to achieve goals. so he gets to have his cake and eat it too. his love of people is on display as ever, and although his characters often lack depth and aren't particularly interesting, they are still warmly characterized and pleasant to be around. sympathetic characters because Scalzi is a sympathetic sort of author. but he also finally gets to openly slam the Colonial Union and their war-mongering, secretive, tunnel-visioned ways. this is the third book in the series and the preceding books almost function as a wind-up to what turns out to be a mean right hook. stupid fucking Colonial Union, they've been long overdue for a knock-out.\n",
      "\n",
      "as usual the writing is pleasant and also generic. I did notice an increasing tendency to make things a bit too much on the nose. there's the name of the colony itself, \"Roanoke\", which of course has all sorts of resonance. but at least Scalzi acknowledges that. what's rather aggravating is the on-the-nose quality of the dialogue. it's always snappy and sarcastic and everyone responds with perfect timing; it's like a sitcom minus the laugh track. the end result is that it comes across as a bit plastic and characters sound a lot like each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "still, that's a minor complaint. overall this novel is fast-paced fun, full of adventure and politics and battles and aliens. because Scalzi is more interested in the human condition than anything else, his aliens often act just like humans. that can be annoying, but fortunately in this one he has a couple that don't: Hickory and Dickory. they were also pretty fun and I'm looking forward to getting to know them better in the follow-up novel.\n",
      "\n",
      "oh the synopsis, in my rush to get out of here I almost forgot: characters from prior novels lead a group of colonists to a new planet. the book is all about the layers upon layers of intrigue that surround this colony.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I’m no expert at colonizing newly discovered worlds, but I gotta think that naming your new planet ‘Roanoke’ and your settlement town ‘Croatoan’ is just asking to be pimp slapped by fate. Why not just christen a ship ‘Titantic’ or call that new nuclear plant ’Chernobyl’? What’s the worst that could happen?\n",
      "\n",
      "The third installment of this series finds John Perry and his wife Jane retired from the Colonial Defense Force and living quietly on a colonized planet with their daughter. The CDF approaches them to head up a new colony, Roanoke. All the other colonies have been started using people from Earth, but Roanoke will be the first to be made up of a hodge podge of people from different colonized worlds, and this makes it a political hot potato. John and Jane agree to head up the new colony, but they quickly learn that the CDF hasn’t told them everything and that the Roanoke colony is a pawn in the conflict between the CDF and other alien races.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like or , is a fun and fast mix of space combat and politics. Scalzi creates characters you like and then throws them into plots that race from one huge event to the next, and he also injects a welcome sense of humor into the books. My only complaint is that the pace is so fast that Scalzi skimps on descriptions of settings, people and alien creatures in favor of dialogue and action so that I sometimes had a problem getting a clear picture in my mind of what was going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is space war action several notches above what you usually get in this genre, and any sci-fi fan should check out this series.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is the point in the series where the story needed to make me fall in love with it as much as the first book did. Coming off a decent, albeit underwhelming second novel (Ghost Brigades), I wanted Last Colony to evolve into a series I could endorse as passionately as The Expanse. Alas, while I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish, the book did leave a few points to be desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest complaint is the lack of description. Scalzi has all of these interesting alien species, but I'm at the halfway point in the series and couldn't begin to tell you what they look like. I love myself some xenobiology, but I feel the author has taken what should be a selling point to the series and glazed over it with ambiguity.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least Last Colony saw the return of my fav, John Perry, and an interesting convergence of storylines from the first two books. The humor came back in force and played a huge factor in my overall enjoyment.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day, while I've concluded there are some weaknesses to this series, all the strengths add up to give me an easy sci-fi, perfect for a light reading mood. My Fantasy Buddy Reads group on Goodreads has called it \"hefty fluff\" or \"fluff-plus\" and I don't think it inaccurate. I would definitely recommend it anyday for someone in the mood for a bit of fun.\n",

      "Tras \"La vieja guardia\" y \"Las Brigadas Fantasma\", Scalzi nos vuelve a ofrecer una novela de aventuras y entretenimiento. Es Scalzi, no lo sueltas.\n",
      "\n",
      "John Perry y Jane Sagan han encontrado la paz junto a su hija adoptiva Zoë en el planeta colonial Huckleberry. Es una buena vida, pero sienten que les falta algo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Por eso, cuando se les propone liderar una nueva colonia, John y Jane no pueden resistir la tentación de explorar el universo una vez más.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pero cuando los colonos son abandonados en un planeta desconocido, Perry descubre que nada es lo que parece.\n",
      "\n",
      "Él y su nueva colonia son simples peones en la confrontación entre la Unión Colonial humana y la confederación alienígena denominada el Cónclave, que pretende frenar la colonización humana.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mientras la partida se decide, Perry deberá proteger a sus colonos de la amenaza que suponen ambos bandos y mantenerlos con vida en un planeta que esconde sus propios secretos. Al mismo tiempo intentará prevenir una guerra que podría significar no sólo la destrucción de su nuevo hogar, sino también la aniquilación de toda la Unión Colonial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Esta tercera entrega es un poco diferente de las dos primeras. Mientras que la sombra de la guerra permanece de fondo todo el tiempo, la epicidad, sangre y acción es baja en comparación. Tiene su dosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "John y Jane son personajes entrañables, al igual que Zoe, Hickory y Dickory, y Savitri es una buena adición a la historia. Algunos por lo que he visto en el epílogo se los extrañará.\n",
      "\n",
      "Continuando con mi camino de Scalzis con este tercer libro avanzamos en la política galáctica, las conspiraciones y batallas espaciales hacen que la vida, difícil y peligrosa de un grupo de colonos planetarios sea mucho más peligrosa y letal.\n",
      "\n",
      "John Perry y Jane Sagan han estado viviendo con Zoe en una colonia llamada Huckleberry hasta que los envían a crear una nueva colonia, Roanoke. Solo que no les dicen toda la verdad y el Cónclave está al acecho de colonias rebeldes.\n",
      "\n",
      "La escritura de Scalzi está en la mejor forma posible. Ágil, engancha como los anteriores y dado que John Perry es el personaje principal, hay más de humor que en anterior. Aún así, conserva momentos igual de serios. Un buen equilibrio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Una de las cosas que más me gustaron fue que Scalzi no le tembló la mano en cambiar las cosas cerrando algun círculo. Pero sobretodo, una vez terminé el libro, me alegré de que a Scalzi aún le queden historias por contar en este genial universo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Súper soldados verdes, generales alienígenas y guardianes sin emociones. Tenemos aspectos de la vida como el amor y la familia pero también la guerra, la opresión, la política y lo que en esta saga más destaca, lo que significa ser humano.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scalzi es un genio algo cabroncete con un plan muy bien pensado y mejor tejido detrás de una sonrisa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Puedo entender por qué algunos no \"disfrutaron\" tanto este libro. El enfoque principal no está en lo militar, al menos no al principio. Hay algo de intriga política y una creciente amenaza de un personaje muy interesante.\n",

      "Scalzi no defrauda. Palomitero hasta el final..✍️\n",

      "“The Last Colony” is so far the weakest in the Old Men's War series. After “old people\" (part one) and special forces (second volume), in the third instalment, Mr Scalzi focuses on the colonists and colonial life in general. The main characters are our old friends, John Perry and Jane Sagan. In a sense, this book finalises the stories of these two. John is an ombudsman on the remote planet of Huckleberry. It is a just the right job for a war hero without any experience useful in the daily life of a backwater rural colony. Jane is the local constabulary. Zoe, their adoptive daughter, has a blast of a teenage life. They even have two domesticated aliens to keep them company. Life’s good.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, for reasons beyond my understanding, The whole “twist” was beyond my comprehension. They are not blackmailed. They have no obligations (except for a perverted sense of moral duty). They even have no direct or indirect benefit in it. Still, they hop on. And I have to say that the author did not manage to convince me why they shouldn’t say “no, thank you” to the CU. I would.\n",

      "While it is (his POV is very distinct and - the scene with Chengelpet brothers and their goat was just priceless), and so the book read slower (at least for me). Frankly speaking, the . I have no fondness for Westerns and frontier towns and all the settler business was not that appealing.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the initial boredom, as the whole scheme goes awry (as expected) . This was the precise moment when I understood why I had previously enjoyed the series so much. Simply put, it wasn't serious. It was fun, pure entertainment. And it was OK because not everybody needs to attempt to mimic Immanuel Kant. Not everybody should do that, in fact. And here, within few pages, we go .\n",
      "\n",
      "The ignoring the simplest laws of alliance building and working in concert as a security community. There is a UN without the Security Council (it is called Conclave) and it operates as if in the space the obstacles to interplanetary cooperation (lack of trust, lack of information and free riding) were as absent as gravity. It would be hilarious if it wasn't obvious that Mr Scalzi is serious this time and not winking at the reader. And that he really believes in the beautiful dream of multi-culti in the space where many races would live in peace and harmony, and among rainbows and unicorns… wait. No. No unicorns.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those of you who wonder why I am so vehemently opposed to this blatant and stupid propaganda, please read John Msarsheimer’s essay on international institutions as a cause of peace here in the and here in a 5-minute . I promise it is worth your time.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of all this , there is the totally Colonial Union as a and the wise Conclave leader who eschews power but would kill for (pun intended and justified!) deliberative democracy and burden sharing. The whole book is written on\n",

      "This a great book. It does not just lay out the standard urban legends. The author is a professor of folklore, and he traces the evolution of urban legends, some of which go all the way back to the Middle Ages.\n",

      "The Choking Doberman collects different variations of urban legends from the 1970s and 1980s with very little contextualization. The lack of any description or explanation of the culture that gave rise to these stories is often jarring. To give an example, Brunvand recounts the myth of a young white boy who enters a public restroom in a Kmart only to be mutilated as part of a Black gang initiation ritual. He claims that it's not a new story, as it's comparable to European folklore about Jewish congregations kidnapping Christian boys in order to serve their genitalia at Passover Seder dinners. I understand the analogy, but all of this could use some serious cultural unpacking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author isn't concerned with discussing what urban legends are and how they spread, and he doesn't seem to be interested in talking about the cultural anxieties these narratives reflect. Rather, his primary objective is to prove that these stories didn't really happen. Instead of taking an analytical approach to the transmission of contemporary folklore, Brunvand mocks and belittles his sources, which can be very uncomfortable to read. One of the more absurd examples is when Brunvand argues that no reputable doctor would link cigarettes to cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Choking Doberman is uncritically recounted from a white male perspective. This results in a number of unfortunate arguments, especially when combined with a lack of contextualization. For example, Brunvand argues that date rape is nothing more than an urban legend because no one has ever actually been date raped. Date rape always happens to \"a friend\" of the male writer/reader, after all, and therefore it can't be real.\n",
      "\n",
      "I read this book because it was recommended to me as a classic text in the study of urban legends. That may be the case, but The Choking Doberman feels more like a relic of its time than a key source that still deserves serious attention and citation.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "More from the 1980s expert on American folklore and urban legends. These aren't just the friend-of-a-friend stories that we've all heard at one point or another, but also a look into how these things spread, and how certain themes fit in with fears of the times, even how themes can continue over hundreds of years, adapting with society and travelling across countries. It's very interesting, but not too scholary or heavy going, so overall good reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brunvand covers a variety of themes in this book, kicking off with the Choking Doberman and various dog and attacker stories. There's even an interesting and lengthy account of rumours and urban myths that caused the company P&G a lot of headaches when it got all over the States that their company logo was a Satanist symbol and they donated profits to Satan. They actually hired 15 full time telephonists at one point to field calls about it. The mind boggles.\n",
      "\n",
      "One reference in the Sex Scandals chapter was a bit depressing. I don't know if this was just the perception thereof in the 1980s, but men spiking women's drinks with drugs and then raping them later on when they're senseless got a mention. In a book about urban myths. True, this hasn't happened to me or anyone I know of, thank god. But this one has come up in the media so much, even just now there's appeals here in the UK against the release of Warboys who was convinced of doing just that to female passengers in his taxi. Not sure how appropriate that one is in a book about urban legends anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "But otherwise an entertaining and thought provoking read. As a human race we've been creating these myths since the beginning of time and nothing has changed. We just can't help ourselves telling tales.\n",

      "Decent book but I had a hard time getting into it. Fortunately for me it was perfect for my girlfriend who adores that kind of stuff. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys the type of nonfiction writing that elaborates on why fiction pieces like \"urban legends\" come to be.\n",

      "I hate that phrase, “A picture’s worth a thousand words”. It’s trite. Simplistic. And horrendously true. Pictures have power. Take the story that’s been handed to us about African-Americans for decades. The images that appear in our news all tell stories of black violence, crime, and poverty. Stories that people buy into because, after all, can’t you believe your eyes? Children’s books could be a respite from that kind of misrepresentation were it not for the fact that they’re often little better. If you’re a black boy looking for some kind of representation in your books of brown-skinned American boys that aren’t (A) Slaves (B) Former slaves or (C) Living during the Civil Rights Era, good luck to you. And photographs? I mean, finding children’s books with photos to begin with is hard these days. Oh, there was a time back in the 50s and 60s when you might find a book like by Jane Wagner and Gordon Parks, but in spite of the fact that the printing costs of photos in picture books is cheaper than ever, the publishing industry generally treats photography as an embarrassing art form that’s only good for accompanying nonfiction texts. Enter Nina Crews, one of the few photographers working today that regularly includes photographic images of contemporary black kids in her children’s books. She’s paired her work with poetry in the past, though it’s usually of the nursery rhyme variety. Now with she tries something new. The haikus of the great author Richard Wright are paired with image after image of black boys running, walking, riding, and just generally staring into a natural world that is this close to showing them the future. A tomorrow that we would all like to see more of.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s becoming a good year for the great African-American writers of the 20th century. James Baldwin’s only book for children is being reprinted, there’s a novel of a boy discovering the world of Langston Hughes in by Lesa Cline-Ransome on the horizon, and now Richard Wright has his very first collection of haikus in a form for young readers. Originally published after his death in 1998 in the collection , Nina Crews has selected a svelte twelve from a possible four thousand. With each poem she constructs squares of photographed images of nature. Forests rise, skies are pieced together, and the poems are featured alongside brown boys that help to embody everything Wright is implying. A brief biography of Richard Wright appears at the back of the book alongside A Note On the Illustrations and well-curated suggestions for Further Reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s head off at the pass the whole “what is haiku?” question right here and now, if we can. As far as I can ascertain, there are several ways to tackle that question. You’ve got the folks that adhere to the strict 5-7-5 syllable style, and do not think much about the subject matter. Then you have the folks that point out that the 5-7-5 style is a Western construct. In fact some children’s books (like Jon J. Muth’s ) don’t adhere to it at all. Then there’s the subject matter, which, in traditional haiku focuses on nature and how we, as humans, relate to it. In the case of this particular book, Mr. Wright adheres to the 5-7-5 format and he also makes certain that even a poem about the railroad feels a part of nature (after all, trains are experienced by most folks in an outdoor setting). Ms. Crews for her part has selected a wide variety of types of nature, all the better to accompany with her images.\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of curiosity, I wanted to see if anyone had ever collected Wright’s haikus for kids before. To my astonishment (or was it sadness?) I found that anytime Wright’s haiku comes up in a children's book, he’s just one of many poets in an anthology. There was the , , (the one edited by Arnold Rampersad and Marcellus Blount), and a few others. Good books, sure and certainly, but why has no one ever rated Wright’s haikus worthy on their own merits for young readers? Why indeed. Perhaps no one felt equal to the task. Haiku, after all, is difficult to display in a children’s book format unless you know how to tackle the material in an interesting way. And photographs are, to my mind, mighty interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years ago I organized a panel of photographers working in the field of children’s literature. And, since this was New York after all, I had to make sure that Nina Crews was included. You simply can’t think of artists that illustrate children’s books with photographs (or can you even call it “illustration” at all?) without thinking of Ms. Crews. She was one of the first artists unafraid of Photoshop, producing books like , working with large publishers. I always enjoyed her work, but I felt like I was waiting for something. Something on a grander scale or something. Turns out, I was waiting for . Because it isn’t just her selection of the twelve Wright poems that deserves notice. Look how she’s changed her own style to match. First off, there’s the fact that she’s placing her subjects in nature. Because she lives in Brooklyn, so much of Ms. Crews’ work has been set in the city. And, to be honest, it still is sometimes. If I’m not much mistaken the poem of the boy walking the dog looks an awful lot like Prospect Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, there are true moments of nature beyond the borders of NYC. Her Photoshop work has grown more natural over the years. But most interesting to me was how the backgrounds are cut into overlapping squares and rectangles. I thought long and hard about why she chose to illustrate the book in this way. Then I noticed how well the haikus fit into the blank spaces inside or beside or under the photographs. Haiku, should anyone ask, is supremely difficult to make visually interesting. I’ve seen librarians discount haiku collections where the design overwhelmed the subject matter. Not so here. Here, the font is large and the presentation cool and clear and calming. As for the photos, what could come off as disjointed instead becomes an extension of nature itself. The boys featured here are both part and not part of the backgrounds. And why just black boys? As she explains in her “Note On the Illustrations”, after learning about Mr. Wright’s own youth, she wanted, “the reader to imagine the world through a young brown boy’s eyes. A boy, like Richard Wright, who found wonder in the world around him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also the occasional in-joke for die-hard children’s literature fans. It was my co-worker who pointed out to me what was going on with one particular poem. The text reads, “Empty railroad tracks: / A strain sounds in the spring hills / And the rails leap with life.” The picture features a freight train coming from wooded hills while a boy and his grandfather watch. I don’t suppose it ever occurred to me to wonder who that older man might be. I had forgotten that Nina Crews is part of a longstanding children’s book legacy. Her mother was Ann Jonas, perhaps best known for the picture book . Her father? None other than Donald Crews, the genius behind that picture book / board book standard . And there he is in this photograph, big as life, with Nina’s own son, watching a real life freight train chugging on past.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m trying to think of books to compare this one to. Trying to think of books about black boys that give them their proper due. A couple years ago I tried counting all the middle grade novels about African-American boys printed in a given year. I came up with five. That number’s slightly higher these days, but black boy pride is still too rare. Maybe things are looking up, though. Last year the Derrick Barnes/Gordon C. James picture book won a Caldecott Honor and a Newbery Honor. This year Tony Medina’s (another book of poetry) is getting rave reviews. With these books make a trifecta. It’s not enough. Let’s fill the shelves with strong black boy characters. Let’s make them so prevalent and common that people start arguing with one another over which one is their favorite. And to start? Let’s read . A book with a foot in the past and a strong future ahead of it.\n",

      "This book is a breath of fresh air showing a side of writer/scholar Richard Wright of which I had not been aware. The rage and hunger central to Wright’s most famous works are nowhere in this collection of his haiku. It is joy, everyday, nature, observations, reflections. It is gentle and Black.\n",
      "\n",
      "For middle and high school educators who still teach Black Boy or Native Son, they must also highlight Wright’s haiku and use this book!\n",
      "\n",

      "Gorgeous book that pairs haikus written by Richard Wright and photographic collages by Nina Crews, featuring young African American boys exploring nature. Must have.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Nina Crews has selected some of Richard Wright’s haiku about his childhood and created an inviting picture book out of them. The haiku focus on the seasons, the outdoors and universal childhood experiences. There are winding dirt roads, yellow kites, blue skies, rainy days, trees and insects. Each haiku is a small window into simple childhood joys and moments that are more meaningful than one might think. They invite us all to slow down, dream a bit and enjoy the nature around us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crews adds modern zing to these poems with her photography. Using a series of photographs that fit together into a whole, they are layered and fascinating. African-American children are forefront in the images that then branch and reach across the page, paving the pages with hope and wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "A dynamic look at one of the top African-American poets of the 21st century, this book of poetry is a celebration. Appropriate for ages 6-9.\n",

      "From the publisher:\n",
      "Ben lives a charmed life - effortlessly landing the lead in the high school musical, dating the prettiest girl in school. When he decides to enlist in the army, no one thinks he'll be in read danger. But his decision has devastating consequences: His convoy get caught in an explosion, and Ben ends up in a coma for two months. When he wakes up, he doesn't know where he is - or remember anything about his old life. His family and friends mourn what they see as a loss, but Ben perseveres. And as he triumphs, readers will relate to this timely novel that pairs the action and adventure of the best war stories with the emotional elements of struggle and transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "My Thoughts:\n",
      "I have always like Harry Mazer's books, especially his World War II Boy at War series. Mazer was an underage enlistee in WWII and knows what he writes about. Now Harry, together with Peter Lerangis, tackles the Iraq War, a war still fresh in our minds as is the on-going war in Afghanistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somebody, Please Tell Me Who I Am is written in three parts. The first part, Before, is the shortest and briefly explores who Ben Bright is, why he made his decision to enlist and the impact it has on those closest to him. As he is leaving on the train for Boot Camp, he proposes to Ariela, his long-time girlfriend.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second part, During, is somewhat longer and covers Ben's time serving in Iraq, the bomb that causes him to suffer a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and, of course, the feelings and reactions of his friends, family and Ariela, now his fiancée, when they hear about his injuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "After is the third and longest part of the story. Ben's family and friends struggle to come to terms with the way Ben is now, while he must relearn everything, including his memories. It is a hard struggle and takes its toll on everyone, but there is also a message of hope in this tragedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The duo of Mazer and Lerangis shine in Somebody, Tell Me Who I Am. By not focusing only on Ben, we see that one person's decision, however noble it may be, and the resulting consequences have serious repercussions on the lives of everyone involved. Oddly enough, Ben has the least amount of action in the novel, in fact, he is almost only a catalyst for his injury, since it is really his TBI that has the real impact on those around him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ben's story is a very poignant and very disturbing without being morbidly graphic. It is well-written and completely realistic. The characters are believable, compelling and strong and the transition from one point of view to another happens very smoothly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ben's story will probably resonate for a lot of young people whose siblings, cousins, friends, husbands or wives may have served in one of this country's wars recently. And as a result, there are families all over the country whose loved ones may have suffered a traumatic injury while serving in Iraq or Afghanistan. This short, but complex story deals with so many of the issues they are facing for real. And, at a time when there is talk about cutting veteran's benefits and services, I think this novel is certainly food for thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is recommended for readers 12+\n",
      "This book was purchased for my personal library.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This book is about Ben Bright, a very talented young man with an amazing musical talent, above average grades, multiple scholarships to universities most kids only could dream of getting into, and a bright future ahead of him. As soon as Ben gets out of high school, he enlists in the army. His family is devastated. They have no idea way he would throw away his future and go to war. When they ask him what he’s thinking, he says he needs to give back to his country for everything it’s done for me. While hes in Iraq, he writes to his family everyday, but one day when his family doesn't receive Ben’s letter, they learn that his military vehicle had ran over a bomb and Ben is now in critical condition. They don’t know if he’ll make it or not, and when he comes home he can hardly walk or talk at all, let alone know who is family his friends are and even where he is. This is what war does to everyone including friends, family and especially the troops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who? Ben Bright, an all-around great student with a bright future, and his family and friends who are devastated when he enlists in the army.\n",
      "What? A young man with a lot of talent some people may say which he is “wasting” to go fight for his country.\n",
      "When? This book takes place in Iraq and United States over the course of 2011, 2012.\n",
      "Where? This story takes place in two different countries which are United States and Iraq where Ben gets called to go fight.\n",
      "Why? The purpose of this book I think, is to show the aftermath of war and the effects it has on everyone around us.\n",
      "Recommendation- I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a quick read with a tragic occurrence, or someone who likes books about modern military.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Somebody, Please Tell Me Who I Am is the story of Ben Bright, a teen who enlists in the Army immediately after high school. The book is told in three parts: \"Before,\" \"During,\" and \"After.\" \"Before\" and \"During are told mostly from Ben's point of view, but then some parts of \"During\" and most of \"After\" are told from the point of view of Ariela, Ben's fiancee.\n",
      "\n",
      "While serving in the Middle East, Ben's convoy is hit by an IED and Ben suffers a traumatic brain injury. When he wakes up back in America, he has no memories of his past life. With the help and patience of doctors, his parents, his best friends, his fiancee, and his autistic brother, Ben slowly recovers some memories.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish that Somebody, Please Tell Me Who I Am was a completely unnecessary book but the reality is that there are lots of young people returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) or TBI (traumatic brain injury). These young men and women may have trouble with day-to-day things such as grocery shopping or interacting with others in social settings, or they may have completely lost their memories. This book would resonate with the friends and families of returning soldiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was also a very quick read. At only 148 YA pages, and with a true-to-life storyline, this would be a great recommendation for a reluctant reader.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Hmm... this book was so short. It covers, in a year and a half, Ben Bright telling his family and friends he's enlisted, proposing to his girlfriend, going through boot camp and off to war, being injured in by IED and losing his memory, coming home, his family (parents, autistic brother, girlfriend and best friend) dealing with this, his struggles with identity after memory loss, his girlfriend's first year in college and almost-affair, his parents' separation and reunion, and his brother writing a poem.\n",
      "So, as you can imagine, it doesn't go into much depth for any part. It's well done enough that you can empathize with what the characters would be going through, but not enough that you feel you know any of them.\n",
      "The result, unfortunately, is that this books is quite forgettable.\n",

      "Love the premise. Loved the first book, but my enthusiasm is waning as the series goes on. I was initially drawn to Ten Beach Road by the mix of \"he done her wrong\" mystery and home renovation diary, all set in a southern Florida setting. Perfect beach read. But as the characters become broader, the situations more absurd and the plot lines and writing increasingly formulaic and repetitive (how many times is Wendy. Wax going to talk about a lover \"cupping her buttocks\"? I swear it's a phrase used in every single romantic scenario - he couldn't pinch, grab or swat her rear, ass, or butt? Why is it always \"cupping\" and \"buttocks.\"?), I'm losing patience and my willingness to suspend not just disbelief but reason. Which is a shame, because the story and the characters -- many of whom receive scant attention in this outing - deserve better. That having been said, I would read the next installment of the series hoping for better results or, at the very least, a few different turns of phrase.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Wendy Wax is the Queen of Do Over! As you can see by my reviews—have read every book in this incredible Ten Beach Road series and each, A 5-Star Winner; however, I believe THE HOUSE ON MERMAID POINT is my favorite thus far!\n",
      "\n",
      "From the stunning front cover (hats off to the designer) to the last page— these characters grab you by the heart and do not let go for a page-turner. A group of kick-ass, talented, and smart women, you will grow to love, for a must read series. , , , and , (you have to read them all)!\n",

      "\n",
      "Even though I love all the women, woman, at age 51, many readers will relate to her, as I did. The self-confidence and image factor, in an age of dating when compared to younger women, especially when they have given their life to their former husband, now divorced, having spent their life raising a family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was super glad offered Maddie some limelight, and happiness, as she is the rock of the crew and her relationship with Hot William was dynamite as they are not done—they sizzle!\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow, powerful and sexy character and loved seeing his transformation. His relationship with his son Tommy was very similar to the parent-child dynamic between Deirdre and Avery. A story of redemption, loss, and love—priceless!\n",

      "however, each of the women’s lives have been on a long journey filled with obstacles, and frustrations, as well as bonding and a great sense of accomplishment.\n",

      "Rooting for Hot William and Maddie to continue on . . . Islamorada was a perfect setting for this book and the surprise ending, as one of my favorite spots in the Florida Keys!\n",
      "\n",
      "Possibly the reason I loved this book the most, could be due following these lovable characters from the beginning. Plus having lived and worked in Islamorada, and the Florida Keys selling real estate opening two projects: A waterfront marina club (condos for boats) and a condo hotel, from construction to completion, with much knowledge of all the fishing, reefs, boating, marinas, and all the hot spots and attractions mentioned in the book.\n",

Maddie had a huge crush on him when she was a teenager, I love the interaction between these two characters, you can actually feel the heat between them! William Hightower is my all time favorite character created by Wendy Wax, so a big thank-you to Wendy for creating Will, when you read this book you will understand what I mean, I may have a crush on him too!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great book to read by the pool, I actually did that and could not put this book down, take to the beach or just read it wherever you can. This series is by far one of my all time favorites to date, the story line is fresh and the characters have grown even more endearing and interesting with each new book in this series . There is also a surprising twist to the end of this book.\n",

      "\n",
      "You know how you might read a book with 5 storylines that will change each chapter. It might be a bit confusing, but at least chapter breaks give you the chance to regroup. This book frequently mixes many storylines, changing paragraph to paragraph with no break - it is up to you to figure out which one is going on! To add to this, there are no quotation marks for dialogue - good luck figuring out who is talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to one of my updates while reading this, someone posted an article about this book (I am too exhausted from this book right now to find the article and directly quote it, but if you Google \"Why are large, painful books considered classics?\" and you will find it.) The gist of it is that people tend to rate these books highly because they are rating their accomplishment of finishing a chunky tome and not necessarily the quality of said tome. I can definitely see that being the case with The Recognitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing that I read was that the book was not well received at first, but then it started getting accolades later on because of its complexity and difficulty to read. I am not sure why that is a good thing, but it was enough for it to become a staple on many \"must read before you die\" lists.\n",

      "– I confess I did not have heart to finish our business so immediately, I spent a few minutes congratulating him. He became very angry when I appeared to question the… authenticity? of this thing, but he was very proud. I saw in his eyes, he was very proud, when we finished our business together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading is similar to looking for one’s way in the thickest jungle but it pays manyfold – the novel is like a crock of gold found at the end of the rainbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book is a painstaking investigation of all possible types of falsehood – in history, in art, in love, in religion, in human beings. And it is an authentic tour de force without any hints at dishonesty.\n",

      "\n",
      "This novel is an exercise in recognitions - within the text, the characters, ourselves. Gaddis intended that we recognize and understand these references and allusions, and apply their meaning to the overall story. He has paid us a high compliment, and respects us as thinking readers who are willing to work with him,\n",
      "\n",
      "The effort is worth it, for this book is a delight. But never mind - it stands on its own even if we don't get all the references.

      "There's a long cast of characters that drift in and out and we lose sight of Wyatt for long stretches. Names are changed! Identities are mistaken!

In college, he had entertained himself and others, quiet evenings in his rooms when his allowance was cut off, by beating the back of his fist with a stiff-bristled hairbrush, then swinging his hand in circles until the pressure of descending blood broke small capillaries and spotted the rug and ceiling with spots turned brown by morning; or standing before a mirror with thumb and forefinger pressed against his carotid arteries until his face lost all color and he was caught by consciousness as he fell....He liked a Good Time.\"\n",

      "\"We would believe that Fuller had had a childhood only in helpless empiricism, because we all have. But it was as unreal to him by now as to anyone looking at his face, where time had long since stopped experimenting. That childhood was like a book read, misplaced, forgotten, to be recalled when one sees another copy, the cheap edition in a railway station newsstand, which is bought, thumbed through, and like as not left on the train when the station is called.\"\n",

In profile, his face was strong and flexible; but, when he turned full face as he did now, the narrowness of his chin seemed to sap the face of that strength so impressive an instant before. Temples faintly graying, distinguished enough to be artificial (though the time was gone when anyone might have said premature, and gone the time when it was necessary to dye them so, instead now to tint them with black occasionally), he looked like an old person who looks very young, hair-ends slightly too long, he wore a perfectly fitted gray pinstripe suit, soft powder-blue Oxford-cloth shirt, and a slender black tie whose pattern, woven in the silk, was barely discernible. He raised a gold cigarette case in long fingers. Gold glittered at his cuff.\"\n",

She advanced with a distinct rattling sound\"\n",

Art, so much art - paintings, sculptures, churches, ornaments. Mummies and babies, roses and lavender, windows. Body parts. And death: suicide, murder, disease, drowning, calamity.\n",

      "Jonathan Franzen bitterly claims is \"difficult\". Maybe. I'll confess that I was better prepared for it than most people. I shrewdly majored in painting at university. The skeletons in my closet were helpful too - some closely resemble the characters in this book. Perhaps that is why I... umm...I tell you is MY book...I don't want to share it. I...I'll bury it. And dig it up from time to time! just as I did with those poor feral kittens from my childhood: dead from worms, buried elaborately with solemn service, the free Gideon bible from school in hand, laying flowers kindly donated from mommy's flowerbed - and yes - exhumed on the odd occasion to see how things were coming along.\n",

      "This book clearly influenced Pynchon and DFW and I would imagine Cormac McCarthy as well, but it is pretty damn unreadable. Looking behind The Recognitions, many level that criticism at Ulysses. Well, Ulysses does require some work, but the difference is that Stephen Daedalus as well as the Blooms are fantastic deeply moving and well-drawn characters and we WANT to see them succeed. In The Recognitions, there is a plethora of characters, but none of which I could have more than a shred of sympathy for: Otto is too pathetic, Wyatt is too broken, Recktail disappears before the end...and the characters around the have amusing characteristics (like the guy measuring the cracks in the ceiling, but I was like, so what.\n",
      "As for comparing it to the next of post-moderns, I think that Pynchon tells a more interesting story, that DFW draws more interesting characters and McCarthy doesn't overload his novels with 1000s of irrelevant characters.\n",
      "The book is written as a triptych where, for me, the first part starts clean and becomes incoherent, the second part is incoherent and the 3rd parts starts coherent and makes a tiny bit of sense at the end. This generates quite a lot of stress to me as a reader.\n",
      "The term \"recognition\" is used a lot in part 1 and then disappears which left me a bit rudderless.\n",
      "I think this book is interesting only in the historical part it played in influencing other writers, but as a standalone piece of art, it does not hold much appeal.\n",

      "Images surround us; cavorting broadcast in the minds of others, we wear the motley tailored by their bad digestions, the shame and failure, plague pandemics and private indecencies, unpaid bills, and animal ecstasies remembered in hospital beds, our worst deeds and best intentions will not stay still, scolding, mocking, or merely chattering they assail each other, shocked at recognition.\n",
      "Shocked, surprised and mesmerized by these Recognitions. Sometimes reading of a book happens without any noticeable event while other times, a single sentence affords the brilliance of a memorable experience. The perceptible sameness of things stimulates an unalterable change, a connection emerges out of nowhere and the voice of a stranger becomes familiar and captivating since it seems to carry the virtues and vices of the whole wide universe within it. This all happened for me after reading Gaddis’s tour-de-force and I can vouch for the same simply because:\n",

      "There are words- Words which are in perfect harmony with each other and words which constantly try to find a visible shore for themselves amidst the sea of inadmissible emotions. Everything from the lucid description of a private space to the reckless telling of bared thoughts is done so masterfully here that one can’t help but wonder at the images that are born out of the revelation of retrospective truth and concealment of destined lies. In between, I found poetry too.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are colors- Colors of the patient sky and impatient homes. Colors of and . Colors of innovative minds and frustrated hearts. Colors of a colorful history and colorless present. And a quest. A quest for identifying real and fake behind the several layers of these colors that emphasize the purity of a blank canvass and the misery of a disquieted soul. I became acquainted with many new shades whose existence was unknown to me.\n",

      "There is nature- A customary meeting that takes place between sun and moon to greet a new dawn and dusk is an essential and my most favorite part of this book. I have never read any writer who embraced nature so intimately and unifies it effortlessly with the emotional upheavals experienced by mankind.\n",
      "Wherever Gaddis took me, he offered the sublime company of warm rays and bright moonlight and during the instances of foggy days; I relished the unusual beauty of a silent landscape. I walked.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is noise- People meet everywhere here. At a random café, at causeless parties, on busy streets, in desolate apartments and in distant lands. They always have so much to say to each other and there is so much which is left unsaid. Chaos prevails, which overwhelms at times but otherwise these voices convey the most profound, entertaining and sarcastic elements that present human psychology both as fascinating and a pitiful spectacle.

The challenge lies not in following the thoughts of countless characters or placing the source of various cultural/religious references but rather not bothering too much about the same. This book is mainly made up of numerous moments, each bearing a significant thread to a central message. There are things which will remain incomprehensible and elusive due to different reasons for different readers, so going-with-the-flow worked pretty well for me. With a little concentration, a little acceptance and a little surrender, it was all akin to a sort of meditation. I was at peace.\n",

      "After great deliberation, I nudged this one up to three stars, but if it wasn't for the end, I would have left it well in the comfortable two.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was annoyed for the majority of the novel, knowing that the stilted characters could have had more life, that there could have been more hints as to who, exactly, was supposed to be the hero of the tale, or, indeed, if there was one at all that I could sit back and watch, going, \"Oh, well I don't like that person too much, but at least they're painted prettily.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, the best I could say about the first 2/3rds was that it started out with action, continued faithfully with action, and kept us In Medias Res until we were bogged down in constant interrogation-speak reminiscent of a million and a half cop shows.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was struck mostly by the incompetence of everyone. I mean, Everyone. At a certain point while reading, I kept trying to think about ways the book could have been made Better, and an idea came to me, fully-fleshed and all excited with a desire to live: This Could Have Been Made As A Comedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just a few tweaks here and there would have turned Ivan into the spunky Stainless Steel Rat, loveable and absolutely capable of getting out of as many messes as he gets himself into. Ida the Interrogator, the bumbling but sociopathic inspector. The captain and the scientist were throwaway shadows with no more life than puppets, and the engineer, who arguably gets almost the most stage-time, spent most of the book being hopelessly outclassed and stumped by THE COMPUTER. It was almost a satire. Terry Pratchett could almost be heard in the other room, shouting hints to the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "*sigh*\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole thing smacked of a second-rate C.J. Cherryh lesser SF novel, or perhaps a 60's pulp. I know this sounds rather cruel, but unfortunately, the only thing about either the writing or the ideas behind it that I really got into, from the very start, was the fact that they were on a spaceship that had housed a small black hole in its innards. Everything else just had me asking unfortunate questions, like: If this is such a heavily-funded project needing the best and the brightest, shouldn't they have gotten more than just three crew? And shouldn't they have been a LOT better at their jobs? Seriously. It wasn't a comedy, no matter how much I thought it could have swung, successfully, in that direction. Hell, I know that Connie Willis could have made this novel comedic GENIUS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. Now on to the better parts. It took a long time to get there, and the reveals weren't that surprising, but fortunately, there WAS a LOT of them. The twist was the return of really old SF ideas, but because they were here at all, it forced me to bump this book up into a higher rating bracket.\n",
      "And the characters become a bit more likeable.\n",

      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I mean, I guess I can understand why so many people have given this book only 1 or 2 stars. A lot of it is one woman trying to fix her ships computer, and huge swathes of text are devoted to another woman interrogating a prisoner, and so it seems that not much is happening a lot of the time. But, on the other hand, it's like, did you people even read the same book as me? Because this book is fantastic. It's amazing. It's the best book I've read all year, and I know it's only February but I know with certainty I'll still be saying it come December.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved this book. I loved that it was mixed character study with hard sci-fi concepts, because all too often if you want hard sci fi you have to settle for flat characters, and if you want rich, real, flawed and fascinating characters you have to look to space opera. The blurb reads like this book is going to be held up by a romance, but there's actually almost none at all, the bones of this book are friendship. The kind of Locke/Jean, Royce/Hadrien bromance that's just a joy to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love that I can't tell you who the bad guys are in this book. Because I don't know who the bad guys are. I know who I liked the most, I know who I wanted to win, but I don't think that made them good guys. Compelling arguments could be made for every character in this book being the villain, even Althea, the closest thing we get to a protagonist, who mostly just cares about her ship's computer. And the characters I wanted to win, when they did \"win,\" well suddenly I wasn't so sure that it was a good thing. Their victory upset me, and the when the character I liked least lost, I felt uneasy about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compelling characters? Check. Delicious moral quandaries that I know my brain is going to mull over for a long time? Check. And the plot, which builds so slowly sometimes it seems to barely move, like one little pebble picking up another and another and another until, whoops, now the whole mountainside is coming right at you, brace yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest complaint I see aimed at this book is that so much of the plot happens \"off page.\" It's backstory, a lot of it, revealed piece by piece over the course of one character interrogating the other. But it's so fascinating! It's the unreliable narrator trope turned up to eleven. Is he lying? Did that really happen? Is that how it happened? He might tell the same story to three different people, and what changes and what doesn't speaks to the truth but still what is the truth really?\n",
      "\n",
      "I could just gush and gush. I loved this book wholeheartedly. Stumbling upon books like this is the whole reason I love to read, because sure most books are fine and some are really good but that moment when your spine tingles and you know you've found something special... Yeah, that's my drug. That's what I'm here for. That's what this book gave me.\n",

      "\n",
      "I do not think the blurb is correct in stating this has any semblance what-so-ever to do with \"Gravity\" or \"Aliens\" and I'm not sure why it was described this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought the book was great in the beginning. You have the 3-person crew which consists of the Captain Domitian, the scientific officer Gagnon, and the system mechanic Althea. They are aboard the ship Ananke which is just one ship in the System Intelligence Agency. I liked the fact that they were on their way to Pluto! They traveled around to the different planets in our galaxy.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had intruders board the ship that were affiliated with a terrorist agency. Their names were Ivanov and Gale, using just last names here. Domitian and Althea caught them and put them in separate holding chambers. Gale ends up getting away, downloads a virus to their ship and takes off in the escape pod.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought all of this was very exciting and I loved Althea trying to figure out what Gale had done to her computer, it was causing a lot of trouble with the ship in different ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boring part (to me) comes when Ida Stays from System Intelligence comes to interrogate the prisoners. She is very upset they let Gale get away, but it is what it is. A whole drawn out section of the book is about this interrogation with Ivanov about things that happened in the past and with the terrorist group. It's just a never-ending conversation. I'm sure it will be fine for some people, this is just my opinion, but I found after so long it was just boring and tedious.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, all of the things going on with Althea and the ship is really interesting. She finds out more and more disturbing things that have been done to the the ship and how it is changing. I can't really say what happens as that will give away the ending. I can say the ending is good and I wonder what is going to happen in the future!\n",
      "\n",

      "==============\n",
      "While reading Lightless, I couldn't help but think of another novel I read earlier this year - Admiral, by another first time author, Sean Danker. Both novels are futuristic, space-based thrillers that limited the scope of the action to a relatively confined space, while gradually revealing bits and pieces of a larger framework. Admiral is a superior book for any number of reasons, but the key difference is that at the end of Admiral, I really couldn't wait to see what Danker had in store for us next. I wanted more, and it couldn't come soon enough. With Lightless, I am utterly ambivalent about what comes next.\n",
      "Some of this ambivalence has to do with the humdrum world-building and pedestrian plotting, but mostly I think it is the uninspiring, one dimensional characters, making obvious choices with transparent motivations. I don't care what happens to them, so I don't care what happens after the last page sets up the sequel.\n",
      "The highest praise I can offer this novel is that it is not boring or offensively stupid.\n",

      "\n",
      "I was disappointed that there is no H.E.A.. for each book in the series. This compares to a four-part book, each part being sold separately, which is fine if the reader realizes it in advance, but not so much when it comes to a complete surprise at the conclusion of each book.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "While I had read the first 3 in the series it had been awhile and there are so many characters in the book with such twisted pasts that the book was just confusing. Relationships are changing, leave the Amish or not, Phoebe gets H1N1 while pregnant and almost dies, the orchard is almost lost. The ending seemed to wrap up everyone’s story too fast.\n",

      "The finale to Rhoda and Samuel’s story was everything I hoped it would be and so much more. Jacob’s sudden departure and his broken heart will lead him on a path to true love but the fallout he leaves in his wake is compelling for everyone involved. Samuel and Rhoda’s relationship grows closer as they hold down the fort and search for answers about Camilla’s lost granddaughter while Landon and Leah’s troubles intensify when her father lays down the law. My heart broke for this couple’s heartbreak and the destruction of their questionable future and for Steven and Phoebe’s family as the characters struggle to keep the orchard going and prays for God’s mercy and intervention. Cindy Woodsmall’s writing tugged on my heartstrings and awed me with her generosity of faith and human compassion while I was simultaneously rooting for a swoon worthy happily ever after for all these beloved characters and it’s well worth waiting for. This series is awesome!\n",
      "Review 5\n",

      "I was actually sad to see this series come to an end. The characters were like well-known friends that you want to keep up with. The author did a wonderful job of wrapping up the story lines of each character. Some things didn't turn out the way I thought they would, but I was pleased with the ending. This is a wonderful series about purpose, God's gifting, the pain and grief of life, healing, forgiveness, family, friends, and community. I enjoyed it immensely.\n",

But when she continues driving in a storm after her sister warns her, she gets hung up in trouble. She wasn’t expecting them to send a sexy man out to save her, but now she is so happy she got hung up in a Montana storm.\n",

But he isn’t looking for a one night hook up or even vanilla sex. He wants his one true submissive to love and he thinks he has found her in Noelle.\n",

      "There isn’t a lot of drama between these two. They are attracted to each other from the start and she is willing to learn if he is willing to teach her for the duration of her stay. They don’t make a lot of promises about the future, but agree to commit to each other for the duration of her stay, which is around a month. Slowly he takes her step by step into his world, doling out punishments and awesome sex to her over the course of her stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noelle is a jewelry designer and maker with a business that can be moved quite easily. So that isn’t a stumbling block. The two also have an age difference, which Cam basically discounts because he is a very fit 49 year old to her 29 years. He wants more kids so that isn’t a draw back, even wants to take them to Disney World. The one thing he does have is an ex-wife who is out to make his life Hell. She causes some accidents to happen that has Cam worrying about Noelle a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entire Hunter family is part of BDSM. Not that they are sharing everywhere or even making their relationships a family thing. Each has a private life within their relationships, it is just well known they are all Doms. Cam often gags Noelle so she won’t scream and alert the house of what they are doing. Although I wasn’t quite sure which family members lived in the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is one scene where Cam’s son and Noelle’s sister fix up a cabin for their scene. Kind of creepy, but they aren’t there when it happens. I think I would rather not have my kids doing something like this for me….ewh.\n",
      "Other than that one scene, I quite enjoyed the story. There wasn’t drama between the two and they grew in their relationship quickly but also steadily.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book club makes several appearances through out the story. Noelle used Skype to join the book club where we see characters from the first books and characters yet to have a book. I loved these women and want to join up to discuss some awesome books. And drink wine…well, I don’t drink wine, but I could find something else to drink. It looked like a blast.\n",

      "This is a horrible book for teens or for anyone for that matter. Just the thought that this man has the audacity to presume what God would say is appalling to me, but to then twist the words of the Bible to turn answers into something that people just want to hear to make them feel better about the sin that they are committing. One girl asks, \"Why am I a lesbian?\", his answer is that she was 'born that way' because of genetics (just as you were born right-handed, with brown eyes, etc.). Then he tells her to go out and \"celebrate\" her differences. My mouth hit the floor!!! It clearly states in the Bible that homosexuality is an abomination and a horrible sin. Clearly this is not what God would say to that question. Another question asks about God's forgiveness of sin. His reply? \"I do not forgive anyone because there is nothing to forgive... There is no such thing as right or wrong and that is what I have been trying to tell everyone, do not judge people. People have chosen to judge one another and this is wrong, because the rule is 'judge not lest ye be judged'.\" THAT is a perfect example of twisting the words of the Bible. I would NEVER recommend this book to anyone and I plan to tell everyone I know to steer clear of it. Clearly this is Satan at his finest. It is clearly !!!\n",

It is so simple and straight forward, and the teens in the book who asked the questions are so honest and direct, and ask questions we all want to know with no pretenses. I would recommend starting with this book for anyone interested in this series. It covered most of the topics in the first four books anyway, in one concise easy to understand book.\n",

With three very sexy men trying to get Stacy to stay with inventive sexual ways who could say no. Only thing reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the book length, would have liked it a bit longer but still a great book.\n",
      "Book2:i love this book, i really like that the brothers are totally different Jackson is flirty, sexy and very romantic but Shayne is dark hurt from rumours and very insecure. Sam is a carer and sorts her brother Pete's problems out, this is how Sam came to Dakota ranch and started to work for the brothers. this book moves fast but you don't feel rush and has a great ending with really sweet HEA.\n",

      "I am really dissapointed. I loved Metro 2033 and I expected Metro 2034 to be equally good or even better - well, I shouldn't have had such a positive attitude. The only thing that stayed as interesting as in the first book is the postapocalyptic universum of people living in the Moscow metro but still, Metro 2033 showed us more of the metro and, in my opinion, did it way better. In Metro 2034, characters (maybe with exception for Leonid who wasn't my type, but still a really interesting person) tend to be boring. Ok, I can't complain about Homer, but Sasha-Alexandra just sucked. I really wanted to like her, I tried so hard! And in some parts I did, but her pathetic \"love\" for Hunter broke everything. None of others really touched me. In my opinion, I might have found it better if I hadn't read the first book before that one - but the author set the target of excellence with first book and couldn't reach it himself writing the second one.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The short: it had so much potential but it was sexist, the characters were stupid, the ending sucked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The long:\n",
      "I loved the first book; the universe, the writing style, the characters, the darkness.... So I wanted to love the second because it had those same things. The plot could've been really cool, if it was executed correctly. The ending left me angry because I felt like if you just deleted basically the entire middle section of the novel, the outcome would've been the same, like the entire journey I just read was actually completely pointless and a waste of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was excited when I heard there would be a female protagonist in this one, but when I read it, it just ticked me off. The pages oozed sexism, in some parts directly stating that women cannot stand tall and strong on their own, they must rely on a man, and it is their job to be beautiful and tend to their man. The female protagonist was a ridiculous character with no backbone, no strength, no real personality, just a fanciful crush on a man she only just met that spurred her to want to fix his brokenness. And that's pretty much the whole novel; a stupid teenage girl lusting after an older, more rugged man - throw in a younger, good looking guy for a crappy love-triangle, and BAM, its like a horrible teen flick with a bit of gore.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "SPOILER ALERT!\n",
      "\n",
      "What a disappointment!\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, it’s not bad, exactly, but it’s poor compared to Metro 2033 - guess I had very high expectations. My main problem here is the lead characters: for the life of me I could not engage in either of them! I miss the first person singular perspective that Artiom provided us with in the first book, and would have expected that Hunter would fill that place here. Instead we only ever observe him from other people’s perspective, where he is alternatively some kind of a super hero, an enigma, a monster, a legend, or someone who needs to be saved from himself. (Or perhaps all.) It annoys me to no end that it is the only female character in the novel(s) that regards him in the latter perspective, I mean, come on, how cliché is that? And hey, guess who died in the end…\n",
      "\n",
      "And don’t even get me started on Leonid the singer…\n",
      "\n",
      "Where the story in the first book was a bit thin too, admittedly, I still found myself deeply intrigued by Artiom’s odyssey through a symbolic hell (the Metro) and his philosophical take on both his mission and the people he encounters. In Metro 2034 everyone seems to be running around all over the place like decapitated chickens, even if they do have a mission too. I mean, get on with it already! The ending, on the other hand, seemed rather rushed to me. Again, admittedly, so was the ending in the first book, but there I was left with a depressing sense of doom: will we ever learn? In this one I felt more like “OK, so they all died, end of story”. :)\n",
      "\n",
      "Having said all that, still, it was an easy read and some of the characteristics of the post-apocalyptic world of the Metro and its inhabitants still intrigued me. Despite its flaws, I would probably have liked it better if I had not read Metro 2033.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I wanted to enjoy this book since I enjoyed Metro 2033 and its video game adaptation, but this was a serious disappointment. What I enjoyed about the first novel - the sheer idea of people surviving the nuclear apocalypse in a vast, sprawling network of underground subway stations and the possibilities it presented - is almost entirely absent from this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "What it does instead if go for a much more straightforward storyline, which is unfortunately far less compelling and interesting. The previous installment read (at least at times) almost like a collection of loosely related stories in the universe, bound by the protagonist and his quest, which takes him through the different stations of the metro, each of which is unique. In this case the author introduces two protagonists (one of whom appears in the previous novel), whose stories interconnect and who both have to accomplish an important goal together.\n",
      "\n",
      "This doesn't sound terrible at all, but this time round Glukhovsky makes it so horribly . His characters are paper-thin (especially Sasha, the teenage girl), and a recurring character from the previous novel is made to be a walking stereotype of a madman traumatized by war. The characters are unlikable and unbelievable, their relationship is cringy and to make everything worse they constantly engage in conversations about deep subjects with each other and other characters that they meet along the way. However, none of this is profound or enlightening in any way, just flat and uninteresting, and successfully removes any sense of tension or interest that the reader might have developed at the beginning. I found myself struggling to finish it, and only did it out of a sense of duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "I struggled to finish this and wouldn't recommend it to anyone, especially to those who liked the previous installment and would like to see more of the underground world of the metro. I know that the author wrote one more book set in this universe, and I might still read it, but for now my enthusiasm to do so has been substantially cooled.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Interestingly, I appear to be one of a tiny majority of people who enjoyed Metro 2034 more than the first book in the series. While the first book did admittedly do more in terms of setting up the environment and the psychological horror aspect of the series, the sequel/spin-off in the following year explores the wider philosophical themes of life in the Moscow Metro.\n",
      "\n",
      "Homer with his musings is one of the best characters in the series by far, and Hunter makes a welcome return.\n",

      "This booklet documents a lecture by Margaret Atwood given at the University of Ottawa in 1996 regarding her thought-process in writing her 9th novel, \"Alias Grace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In it she discusses history, memory (both individual and collective), and her own attempt to write a historical Canadian novel based on fact. Atwood points out that memory and history are inseparably linked as memory cannot be without history and vice versa (and without memory, there can be no novel). As a Canadian growing up, she describes the lack of Canadian historical fiction, or rather, a lack of exposure to it, and posits that while the 19th century was an era that revolved around memory, the 20th was more or less about forgetting (in particular, the horrors of the past, especially of the kind perpetrated by the side who wants to forget).\n",
      "\n",
      "Atwood then speaks of her own experience writing \"Alias Grace\" and the research involved in finding out the truth of the matter. With so many contradictory accounts regarding Grace Marks and the Kinnear-Montgomery murders, she finds herself writing a novel that integrates all points of view. What we get is a narrative that masterfully leaves the reader questioning how trustworthy is the narrator? Or even, how trustworthy is the narrator's memory? And as for the gaps, Atwood fills those in, appropriately, by means of her own creative invention.\n",

      "This was a nice in-depth follow-up to the writing and thought-process of a great novel within the larger scheme of Canadian historical literature as only Margaret Atwood herself could tell it.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "This is the Charles R. Bronfman Lecture in Canadian Studies that was given by Margaret Atwood in Ottawa in 1996. The focus is on \"Alias Grace\", Atwood's historical novel which is based on true events in the life of Grace Marks who was tried and convicted for the murders of her employer and his mistress. In her lecture, Atwood explores the concepts of historical fiction, and how our present continues to be shaped by our past. \"Alias Grace\" happens to be my all time favorite novel, and I love and admire Atwood's writing. She has an uncanny ability to transport the reader into her stories, so that we are not merely reading about her characters but are in fact absorbed into their lives. I still vividly recall the stifling heat of the summer day, the unbearable tension that had been building between the inhabitants of the isolated farm house, that could only be broken by an act of enormity. But what I love more than anything about Atwood's writing is the critical eye she brings to everything. She is never content to give us things as they seem. What is true? How do we arrive at the truths we hold so dear? Everything is examined, little is as it first appears. In this distinguished lecture she holds forth that even our collective history, or what we remember, is in fact subject to interpretation. Memory is faulty at best, and always colored by the storyteller's own experiences. Since history is made of memories, how much of what we believe of our past, is really the truth?\n",

      "Ahh. The things we remember. The things we forget. It is a shame that so many people have Chaucer forced upon them at too young an age in an academic setting so that it is very hard to appreciate how much fun he is and how much he still has to say to us today. I think I first \"received\" a few of the Canterbury Tales in English class in high school in this manner. Then I read a few more in an Intro Brit Lit (pre-1900) class in college. Finally, an entire semester of Chaucer with a Danish professor in the English program during a semester abroad at the University of Aarhus in Denmark in the spring of 1979, which I had completely forgotten about until just now. I can still see the book with its grey cover and red letters, huge – probably 700 pages - which became rather worn from being hauled around to class all semester through snow and wind and rain. I don't remember the professor's name, but I remember that in his quiet, European, sitting-around-the-seminar-table-for-a-little-chat way, he made reading Chaucer as lively and funny and charming and salacious as the Wife of Bath herself. Maybe this is the way that Chaucer needs to be experienced. The only thing that would've made it more appropriate would've been sitting in a pub with a glass of beer in hand.\n",

      "Marvelously put together. As a lover of both the Canterbury Tales and Troilus and Criseyde I was expecting to be happy with the book, however his Good Wives blew me away. Written at a very misogynistic time, but it was a powerfully strong defense of femininity, which would not have pleased the Church of the day. The wealth of poetry and tales he wrote far exceeds just the Canterbury Tales and Troilus and Criseyde, for any lover of Chaucer's work this is a must have for the personal library shelf.\n",

      "Note, Nov. 13, 2015: I just discovered and corrected a typo I missed earlier; where I meant to say \"genre conventions,\" I'd written \"gene conventions.\" Maybe those are meetings of DNA researchers.... :-) While I'm not changing my assessment, I've also edited it to tone down some language that I've decided, in retrospect, was unkind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time travel! A smart, strong-inside heroine who learns to kick some butt! Secrets buried in long-lost documents! Medieval knights, and a castle in the Highlands! Action! Danger! Romance (sort of)! What more could one want for a great read? Well --quite a bit, actually, as the merely three-star rating (rounded up from two and a half!) indicates. :-( At one point, I even flirted with a one-star rating, but I thought this one more fairly recognized the genuine positives. (And my wife --we read it together as our \"car book\"-- has stated that she'd give it four stars, if she were on Goodreads and rating it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The positives real. First, the Goodreads plot summary is accurate, but it doesn't begin to suggest Grace's situation in much of the book. An intellectual, gentle, slightly overweight woman of about 30, who's never been exposed to violence or significant hardship, in the first chapter she witnesses the sudden, brutal murders of both her husband and her brother, who are her only family and the center of her world. Framed for their killings and forced to flee for her life, with no warning and nothing but the clothes on her back and her laptop, she's forced to learn to survive on the street, and off the grid. Driven by a determination to avenge her loved ones, take down the killer, and translate the documents that contain the mystery he's willing to kill for, and needing to stay alive to do that, over time she believably transforms into a street-smart woman who can take care of herself and fight if she has to. She's a very well-drawn, admirable character that the reader readily likes and roots for. All of the other major characters are also vivid and well-developed, including a really hateful villain. The plot is nicely constructed, in the main; some aspects are broadly predictable, but it also included a couple of major surprises I did not see coming. Howard writes well, for the most part; there are a lot of finely-turned phrases, touches of wry humor that balance the serious tone, and effective construction of scenes and evocation of atmosphere. (One reviewer complains about the time devoted to her paralyzing terror, right after the trauma of the killings, over crossing a street to use an ATM machine, and to her problem in finding a place to relieve herself; but to me this was a way of showing the situation she started from, in all its extreme difficulty, and gets us right inside of her head in the midst of it, with no sugarcoating.)\n",
      "\n",
      "For me, though, the negatives were significant. A major one is the treatment of the Templar angle. Since the 1950s (beginning with a now-discredited hoax which any number of pundits and writers still pass on as fact) a pop-culture mythology has grown up around the Templars as guardians of Deep Dark Secrets that supposedly discredit Christianity. The classical version is that Christ didn't die on the cross, but rather lived on to marry Mary Magdalene and sire the line that became the Merovingian royal family of France. Howard leaves out the Mary Magdalene-Merovingian scenario, but she creates her own wrinkles on the theme. Since my background gives me a strong grounding in both serious historical and biblical studies, I can recognize this as on a par with something you might read in a tabloid sold at the supermarket. It's not helped here by the fact that, even taking the book on its own terms, the Templars' interpretation of the physical evidence that supposedly leads them to their theological revelations is so logically flawed and implausible as to be ludicrous. But this idea isn't introduced until the penultimate chapter. And on the other hand, the author does take the existence of God seriously, and has a relatively high Christology; and Grace, in the same chapter, offers an excellent simple explanation of theodicy in terms of free will. So while Christians will have problems with the book, it won't please die-hard religion-phobic readers either.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Howard's writing background and credentials are rooted in the romance genre; and though the cover of this edition and the cover copy don't clearly identify this book as a romance, it does embody some of the genre conventions. (It's no spoiler that Grace and Black Niall will be a couple, since the description and cover copy tell us so.) One of these is explicit sex; of course, not all romances feature this, but this one does, to a considerable degree. (Not all the encounters are between Grace and Niall; and not all of them involve intercourse, but most do.) These scenes, of course, can usually be skipped over (so if you want detailed evaluation of those parts, you're reading the wrong review!), except where crucial dialogue is embedded in them. But the problematic elements here go deeper; for a \"romance\" genre novelist, Howard can be singularly tone-deaf to what makes for real romance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace and Niall, during the course of the book, experience a cross-time psychological connection (at first, just in dreams) that allows them, at times, to experience each other's voice and presence. This is never explained, and doesn't really come across as credible. But it focuses strictly on intense sexual attraction; there's very little if any element of getting to know each other as anything but sex objects. That continues when they meet in person. Given that Grace, at least, is portrayed as a person who takes sex seriously and has never been with any man but her husband, this comes across, as even she recognizes, as out of character. It isn't really plausible either, and rather than making the relationship come across as a \"love for all time,\" as the cover copy bills it, it seems more like a heat period; I didn't feel any kind of personal emotional connection between hero and heroine for most of the book. And while I respect Grace for her past scruples, the juxtaposition with Niall's background of womanizing, and the unspoken implication that this somehow verifies his virility and desirability as a partner, tends, IMO, to reinforce a really unhealthy double standard for males and females.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple more quibbles are worth mentioning. Howard has done some historical research, shown by the array of apparently accurate factoids she can muster here and there. But it's apparent that her research consisted of mining for factual snippets in areas where she realizes that she's ignorant; she does not have a general warp-and-woof knowledge of the medieval world, and that allows her to make a few noticeable (to me, at least) errors. I was also frustrated with Grace for\n",

      "Quick added note: When I typed the review last night, it was late and I was in a hurry (I'd twice been run off the computer earlier that evening by a thunderstorm), so I forgot to mention the bad language factor. There is some of this, including a number of f-words, which come mostly from the villain(s); but even the good characters cuss some. (Harmony has the saltiest speaking style of these, realistically for her background.) There were enough extenuating factors that this wasn't a big issue for me, but readers with even less tolerance for this kind of thing will want to be warned.\n",

      "Grace St John is archaeological scholar. Fluent in five ancient languages, married to another archaeologist and the love of her life. She never imagined that a cache of old documents would soon set her on a path of no return, one in which everything she holds dear and everything she has ever believed in will be put to the test.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was enthralled from page one. Well, let me back up - page one of the first chapter. Someone really needs to tell Ms Howard that prologues aren't normally 13 pages long. But I digress. Grace is a scholar, a tad overweight, a bit nerdy. She speaks five ancient languages fluently, she's married to the only man she's ever had sex with, sickeningly in love with him. She doesn't wear makeup and one of her best friends is a teenage Bill Gates. I was truly at a loss as to how this could be a love story but I was so wrong. This entire novel is a love story, in differing degrees and once I had a chance to sleep on it and think about it, I came to the conclusion that Ms Howard truly outdid herself. This is brilliant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story starts out with Grace working on translating some ancient Celtic papers that hint at a lost treasure \"more priceless than gold\". It's written in several languages: Old English, Latin, Old French, ancient Gaelic...right up her alley and area of expertise. But someone wants these papers and they will kill to get them. Grace watches her husband and brother brutally murdered right in front of her eyes, protecting her whereabouts. (love of a husband/family) She goes on the run with nothing more than her laptop, the papers and the clothes on her back. Her teenage hacker friend helps her to clean out her bank account so she can leave the area until she knows whats going on (love of a friend). On the run, scared out of her mind, unable to conceive what's happened so far, she ends up in a series of towns working for cash, living in ratholes but all the while working on deciphering the Celtic papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's while she is in Chicago that she begins her transformation. (love her husband, brother and self) She discovers that the papers detail the story of one Knight Templar - Black Niall - who is guarding a treasure of untold riches. In shock that her family was slaughtered, that she herself is the target of a madman, for treasure? With the help of a boardinghouse landlady and a scrappy street fighter (love of friends) she begins her change from mousy, nondescript Grace to a woman who will stop at nothing for vengeance. She loses weight, changes her name and appearance and learns a few self defense techniques. Her husband and brother will not have died in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really loved Grace. This story is as much about her as it is about the treasure. If you've heard the saying that you don't know what you can accomplish until you have no other choice - this is Grace. It's heartbreaking to watch her exist, because that's all she is doing for a good part of the book. Unable to let herself grieve for her lost family, she becomes nearly anorexic, unable to sleep. Surviving but not living. Don't get me wrong, she doesn't turn into some badass chick overnight - or at all - she just does what she has to, when she has to, in order to carry on. Eventually she discovers a way to actually to the era of Black Niall (a spoiler I won't give away) in the hopes she can prevent the killers from locating the Treasure (and yes, that's capitalized for a reason).\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationship between her and Niall (romantic love) and the position that Niall holds (love of God and mankind) are spoilers which I won't get into but let me just say they are powerful. At this point, I could not have put this book down had I tried. The ending was wonderful. 5 stars and a recommended read\n",

      "Ever since You Know What began last year, I have been strangely adsorbed by non-fiction - and this book did not disappoint! I couldn't put it down: it is absolutely charming. This memoir delved deeply into the background of both Milne and Shepherd and gave fascinating details on the real life inspiration behind the classic stories we know and love. From botany lessons, to historical anecdotes, to information about the International Pooh Sticks Championship, this book was full of delightful surprises! Beautifully and sensitively written by a true Pooh connoisseur, I'm sure you'll find it to be as sweet as honey!\n",

      "Did you know that Winnie-the-Pooh was inspired by a real place you can visit today?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nature and literature often go hand-in-hand, at least in my mind. Scenery description and a sense of place is one of my favorite aspects of fiction, and I always enjoy learning about the settings of literary works. It makes them that much more real! I didn’t know it before, but the Hundred Acre Wood, the world of Winnie-the-Pooh and his friends, was inspired by Ashdown Forest (which contains a portion called the Five Hundred Acre Wood), in East Sussex, way down on the bottom of England. A.A. Milne, his wife, and his son, Christopher Robin, lived on the northern edge for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Christopher Robin was little, A.A. Milne, already professional and prolific, turned his mind to writing children’s stories, and the greatest of these came out of the life of his son. Christopher Robin possessed toy stuffed animals and played and adventured in Ashdown Forest. Episodes and places in the Pooh stories, such as Poohsticks Bridge and the Heffalump Trap, can be traced to actual occurrences in the Forest and at the Milnes’ home, Cotchford Farm.\n",
      "\n",
      "I learned all this from Kathryn Aalto, the author of . This delightfully written book caters especially to nostalgic Winnie-the-Pooh fans. It includes a fascinating look into the lives of A.A. Milne and illustrator E. H. Shepard, plenty of excerpts and illustrations from and , beautiful photographs, and a grand tour of Ashdown Forest and its connections to the books. I was a little disappointed that some of the events in the books can’t be traced to specific locations in the Forest, but I understand that’d be hard to do, since the Forest itself has changed. The last section is a nature guide to Ashdown Forest. Nature features heavily in the book, as its title would suggest. I recommend this for any serious Winnie-the-Pooh fans and people who love literary landscapes, and English topography in particular.\n",

      "(I received this book for free through Goodreads Giveaways, so I was under no obligation to write a positive review.)\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The Natural World of Winnie-the-Pooh is a book I came across with some interest. It seemed to echo a lot of the more populist literary tourism titles relating to British children's literature (written from an overseas perspective, focusing on a classic and canonical text) and I was keen to see what it made of Ashdown Forest and Winnie-the-Pooh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aalto splits her text into three key sections: the collaborations between A.A. Milne and E.H Shepard; the origins of the stories; and the flora and fauna of Ashdown Forest. There's a slight crossover between these sections and some elements suffer from being repeated, but as a whole it's handled well. Aalto clearly loves her topic and the landscape. The book is liberally illustrated in full colour, both with Shepard's illustrations and with substantial photographs of Ashdown Forest and the local area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain elements of The Natural World of Winnie-the-Pooh did feel overwritten at points and the pragmatist within me longed for less of the conjecture and more of the facts. Books of this nature though are always those which blur the line between truth and fiction quite liberally, and I do genuinely welcome that. I welcome more however, an awareness of that line between the two and often find myself reading these moments with an awareness more of the ideological weight of the sentences rather than a concern for the sentences themselves. Language is revealing, here, superficially, but also underneath. You'll read these reviews and become aware of not only what I'm saying but also the perspective I'm talking from when I review these books. I am soaked in maps and references and literary topography at this point, and they do colour my work. The state of my desk colours my work. The state of my to do list colours my work. What I had for lunch colours my work. They cannot colour my work.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think that maybe, having said all that, I rather love that in texts dealing with literary tourism, and the localism of books, that this personal agenda becomes so foregrounded. It's almost palpable in this book at points; Aalto's intense passion for the site, her attempts to locate the key points of the book within the woods and her passages on the flora and fauna of the forest are a delight. These books come from love, really.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are definitely points when The Natural World of Winnie-the-Pooh could have done with a lot of editing; and a little more concern for the experience of the reader (I rail, somewhat, at cutesy 'let's go and see' paragraphs, but that is an intensely personal stylistic vendetta), but as a whole, it's a passionate and heartfelt tribute to an area of the country perhaps unique in children's literature terms.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "While I loved the concept of this book I didn't always love the book. The beginning was GREAT. It told the history of A. A. Milne and his son Christopher Robin and also told about how many of the places in Winnie-the-Pooh were real based on their childhood experiences. But towards the end it became more like a travel brochure of what to look for while you're visiting Ashdown Forest (and let's be honest, I probably never will that's why I'm reading this book). However, the pictures were beautiful and plentiful. I can feel like I've been there without leaving my home.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Garry Kasparov, you will have noticed by now, is one of my heroes... but, all the same, I must reluctantly admit that this is a terrible book, and downright depressing to read. Kasparov clearly started the project with high hopes. He wants to show you how the skills you pick up from top-level chess can translate into understanding of life in general, and his opening case study, organised around his first World Championship match against Karpov, is inspiring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kasparov went into the match underestimating his great opponent and not understanding what made him so good. It wasn't until he found himself 4-0 down that he realised his straightforward attacking strategy wasn't appropriate. He had to work very hard to catch up: mercilessly analyse his own play to find out what was wrong with it, and learn to think like Karpov. He lost another game, and since the match was first to six wins it seemed it was all over. But he'd learned just fast enough, and he miraculously turned the tables. When the match was declared null and void after 48 games (the only time this has happened in World Chess Championship history), the score was 5-3, and Kasparov had the momentum. He was the one complaining, and most people thought Karpov had been granted a lucky escape. Kasparov had every reason to be proud of his achievement, which was as much about overcoming himself as about overcoming his adversary.\n",
      "\n",
      "If all of the book were like that, I'd have loved it. Alas, there aren't any more brilliant examples. Kasparov is a very honest guy, and it's painful to see how rapidly he loses faith in the idea. He's forced to concede that the raw aggression which made him the best chessplayer in the world for 20 years isn't as good in business or politics, where he's failed to impress. The further you get, the more it comes across as a bunch of poorly structured notes that Mig Greengard, his long-suffering collaborator, has tried without success to whip into coherent text. There's a good anecdote here and there, and if you haven't read Kasparov's wonderful you may enjoy some of the material he's summarised from it. But for people familiar with his other writing, it's slim pickings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truly ironic thing is that Kasparov's chess-infused world view provides a reasonable metaphor to explain what's gone wrong. MTQ, he constantly tells you: Material, Time, Quality. Kasparov, a dynamic player, was always happy to gambit material for time or quality of position. Here, he's sacrificed quality and time in the interests of picking up some material profits - I suppose this book reached a wider public than the very technical , and hopefully it made him a few dollars. But he's working against his own fundamental principles, and he hates it. Garry. Please don't do this to yourself again.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is an engaging book, written by a world-champion chess player, Garry Kasparov. He shows how the lessons he learned from the chess world can carry over into everyday life, business, and politics. Most of these lessons are based on interesting anecdotes, stories about his own life in chess, or about other chess players. Here is a sampling of these lessons. There are plenty more in this book!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes in chess you are at a point where you would like to stay stationary, without making a move. Of course, in chess, moving a piece each turn is obligatory. In life, when all is well, you can \"do nothing\". But it is usually better to \"do something\" instead of doing nothing. You can always find ways to better prepare yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "When talking about strategy and confidence, Kasparov writes,\n",
      "\n",
      "Kasparov talks a lot about the trade-offs between quality, material, and time. These trade-offs occur both in chess and in life. For example, in chess one can trade material (chess pieces) for a higher-quality position on the board. A company can trade material (resources, money, etc.) for a better competitive position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kasparov also makes numerous parallels to business and to war. He takes situations from World War II and from the Napoleonic Wars. There is a need in chess, in business, and in war to be aggressive and an innovator. Innovation is about survival. Complacency is one of the most dangerous attitudes in all walks of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old adage \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" belongs only in the plumber's trade. We shouldn't live or work that way. Kasparov advises to question the status quo at all times, when things are going well.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, after losing, someone tells you that \"you did your best\", it is small consolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kasparov advises against becoming too narrowly focused. Richard Feynman, the Nobel laureate physicist believed that playing bongos made him a better physicist. \"Solving new problems is what keeps us moving forward as individuals and as a society.\"\n",

      "Kasparov left professional chess in 2005, and went into politics. It is dangerous to be in opposition to Putin in Russia. However, he does not feel intimidated by other politicians, because he spent his entire life under an intense spotlight. I would speculate that because great chess players are adulated in Russia, Kasparov is somewhat protected against overt aggression in his political career.\n",

It is a friendly, soulful introduction to his life and what realizations he chanced on.\n",

More, Kasparov is a gruffy voice you enjoy hearing while reading :)\n",

      "Seamos crueles: si la vida imitara realmente al ajedrez, Kasparov sería hoy el presidente de Rusia, y no Vladimir Putin. Apenas un año después de que se publicara este libro, con todo su optimismo, su autor fue obligado mediante trucos viles a abandonar su campaña presidencial. Más tarde, el temor por su seguridad personal lo llevó a exiliarse en Nueva York, donde hasta hoy sigue viviendo y odiando a Vladimir Putin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Por supuesto que el fracaso efectivo del autor no invalida su texto. El ajedrez puede ser una fuente de sabiduría, de enseñanzas aplicables a otras esferas de la existencia, y eso es lo que Kasparov, con variable entusiasmo, se propone demostrar. En alguna medida, supongo que lo logra, pero me parece dudoso que su sapiencia ajedrecística pueda ser de utilidad para otras personas – o siquiera para sí mismo en sus otras actividades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeee, el ajedrez enseña cosas, lo mismo que el tiro con arco, la jardinería, el trato con chimpancés, la simple cotidianidad, y realmente cualquier otra actividad a la que una persona se dedique intensamente, y a lo largo de mucho tiempo. Este último es (¿cuándo no?) el factor tiránico, porque es el tiempo invertido en el aprendizaje de patrones, de recurrencias, de secretos, el que fija las lecciones aprendidas y las hace útiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "¿Puede un conocimiento adquirido de esta manera transferirse a otras personas en forma instantánea, con nada más que un libro? Yo creo que no.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dejando de lado los aspectos más ambiciosos, o más de autoayuda del libro de Kasparov, también tiene pasajes de genuino interés, que son aquellos que le dedica sin más al juego, a su historia, y a las rivalidades que inspiró. Puede ser que, como nuestros padres, Kasparov nos enseñe más precisamente cuando no está preocupado por enseñarnos nada.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Le letture si richiamano sempre tra loro; e infatti sono stato arrivato a questo libro leggendo la \"Storia parziale delle cause perse\", dove il personaggio descritto nel romanzo si ispira proprio a Kasparov.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chi è Garri Kimovic Kasparov? Campione del mondo di scacchi all'età di 21 anni, titolo che ha detenuto poi per ben 15 anni, è stato definito come il più grande giocatore di scacchi di tutti i tempi. Una volta diventato \"vecchio\" verso i quarant'anni (sì, come i matematici, anche gli scacchisti perdono buona parte delle loro capacità creative dopo i 35 anni...) è stato anche il maggiore avversario politico di Vladimir Putin, venendo per questo arrestato più e più volte dalla polizia russa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Di cosa parla il suo libro? Di tecnica scacchistica? Di politica? Della storia della sua vita? No, nel libro non ci sono assolutamente regole, tecniche di gioco o resoconti di partite di scacchi. Il libro ha sicuramente un contenuto autobiografico, ma è anche una parziale storia degli scacchi e un manuale per il miglioramento dell'efficienza personale e di motivazione manageriale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Per Kasparov, un grande uomo che certamente spicca per la ferrea determinazione e per una lucidità e pulizia mentale fuori dal comune, i problemi di strategia e di tattica che si incontrano negli scacchi sono terribilmente analoghi a quelli della vita reale. In pratica tutto si riconduce alla necessità, nella vita come negli scacchi, di avere una precisa strategia e di perseguirla con tenacia e determinazione .\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Per fare le giuste mosse dobbiamo sapere che cosa stiamo cercando, che cosa vogliamo raggiungere\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Il primo passo è avere degli obiettivi precisi, il secondo è rimanervi coerenti e non abbandonare il cammino\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nella vita non esiste l'obbligo di fare una mossa. Se non si è in grado di elaborare un piano di utilità si può guardare la televisione, giocare o perdere tempo. Gli esseri umani sono straordinariamente creativi nell'escogitare modi per passare il tempo senza costrutto. È in quei momenti che un vero stratega si distingue trovando il sistema per migliorare e rafforzare le proprie posizioni in vista dell’inevitabile conflitto.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sembrano banalità, quelle dette da Kasparov; avere una strategia di vita, ossia darsi degli obiettivi, e perseguirla. Non lasciarsi distogliere dagli elementi di disturbo e dalle perdite di tempo. Mai desistere in caso di difficoltà. Facile no?\n",
      "\n",
      "Un libro interessante, questo di Kasparov, scritto in modo facile e scorrevole. Quale è il suo insegnamento più grande?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ci vuole una grande forza interiore per fronteggiare i fallimenti, per accettare il fatto che dobbiamo effettuare dei cambiamenti e ancor più per metterli in pratica. Churchill disse: «Il successo non è definitivo, il fallimento non è fatale: quello che conta è il coraggio di continuare». Coraggio che può essere stimolato dalla competizione o da un numero infinito di fattori esterni, ma che alla fine deve nascere dentro di noi\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ovviamente progettualità, determinazione e determinazione non sono sufficienti a risolvere qualunque problema. Non sono state sufficienti ad esempio a Kasparov per vincere il suo grande avversario politico, che non rispetta alcuna regola ed è spietato e potentissimo. Non possono vincere le malattie o la morte. Ma certamente possono consentirci di sfruttare al meglio il tempo della nostra vita.\n",

About Daniel Craig is still a \"work in progress\" where also I have watched several times and while I enjoy some elements of the movie, I can't say that I truly like the film, I don't like at all and I do really like a lot , so I still giving a chance to Craig to full get into my list of favorite Bonds.\n",

      "Some people may wonder what's the appealing about this whole thing of James Bond and nowadays where you have a vast list of blockbuster movies from many franchises, it's kinda easy to see James Bond like just another in the bunch, James Bond films came in '60s when you don't have any blockbuster films and certainly special effects was like a bad joke, so, James Bond films came to fill a need in high-budget action films that nobody else has been able to make before, and certainly Bond movies inspired to a whole new generation of filmmakers to do quantum leaps later in the 70s and 80s to bring the cinema to a whole new level of entertainment.\n",

However, the encyclopedia is focused into presenting the movie exploitings of James Bond.\n",

The novels are the weirdest part.\n",

      "But I'll take it. I'll take it for the photos, for the quotes, for the names one might otherwise have missed. Minnie Driver, for instance, played Robbie Coltrane's tone-deaf girlfriend in Goldeneye. Her name was Irina. If that is of interest to you, you will want this book.

      "Queen of Fire is the third and last book in Anthony Ryan’s Raven's Shadow trilogy that began with the incredible Blood Song. By now, if you’ve heard about this trilogy, you’ll most likely have heard from several readers that the series didn’t end as good as the first book. I, unfortunately, have to agree with them completely. Anthony Ryan himself is great as an author and person, it seriously pains me to give this or any of his book a low rating but I really have to be honest that I didn’t enjoy reading at all. I’m not angry at this book, but I’m genuinely sad and disappointed. How is it even possible that a series that began so brilliantly can derail this much? Even coming into this with the lowest of expectation, I still found myself disappointed at the final product of this tome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where do I even begin? Pretty much every cons I mentioned about exponentially worsen in . Vaelin in and Vaelin in / seriously doesn’t sound the same. None of his voices, actions, and internal thoughts (when there’s any) contained any resemblance of his character in . Not only that, his POV here ended up being one of, if not, the most boring storyline of the entire series. Reading an autobiography about someone’s journey in Antarctica would’ve made for a more engaging experience than reading Vaelin’s journey here, which was full of him walking and doing nothing in the snow. I don’t get it, I can’t see Ryan’s vision and what he tried to achieve with Vaelin in this trilogy. Ryan has spent the entirety of the first book Vaelin’s character, making the reader love and cares about Vaelin; he’s badass yet flawed, kind, and empathetic. The friendship he built in the brotherhood of the Sixth Order was one of the best parts of the first book; ALL of these are gone. It has gotten worse up to the point that if you don’t read Blood Song, you’ll still be able to understand both and ; frankly these two books made me disliked Vaelin more and more, Ryan really threw away everything that’s great about Vaelin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, if the other characters have the power to balance things out, I would’ve accepted it more. But the other characters were also unlikeable. The main problem is that there’s literally none of the characters that I feel invested in; deaths happen and I would be like “oh okay bye bye adios wait who are you again?” Reva also goes against every incredible development that Vaelin had in . Vaelin was never a Gary Stu, seeing him slowly learn and practice with bows or non-Sword related ability made readers realize that maybe his true talent lies only in a swordfight, he has to start and learn from scratch for other talents. Reva is the exact opposite of this. I’m never a fan of her, not in where her first appearance as Mary Sue appeared, and definitely not here. Lyrna was at least great to read in , but here? She was just outright hateful and despicable.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be honest, the only characters that ended up being slightly compelling to read was Frentis (which, as I said before, resembled Vaelin from more than Vaelin himself now) but his dreamscapes were annoying to read. None of the characters—except Verniers—have distinctive voices and the addition of another new POV here made things even worse. I’m serious, except for Verniers, if you switch around the names of the POV characters, it would be bloody difficult to tell whose POV you’re reading. Plus, there were so many names within this installment but the majority of them doesn’t have any anchor value for remembrance; I recently reread and read , it was crazy how fast I forgot the side characters. I couldn’t tell anymore whether it’s because I genuinely forgot the characters or because I just met them here; most of them don’t have any value other than making things more confusing than necessary anyway.\n",

      "Also, let’s talk about the narrative tone and expectations set in the first book of a series. If you want a series to turn completely grimdark, there needs to be something at the first installment of the series that shows glimpses that it has the potential to turn this way. didn’t show any inclination that the story will turn this way. There’s so much gory violence and they ended up being shock factor—that’s not shocking—to show that the enemies are ruthless. If you spend the entirety of the first book on a single character, you don’t make this character become pointless and super pathetic to read. It almost felt like Ryan hated Vaelin so much that after he degrade Vaelin more and more with each installment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, as I said before, and should be treated as a different series to . There were still many more negative factors that I could elaborate—sluggish pacing, villain’s weak motivation, the anticlimactic ending—but honestly? I’m too exhausted and disappointed to write more about it. I’ve spent too much of my time on this book already, I don’t want to spend any longer by prolonging the review too. Let’s simplify it this way: I’ve never seen such a unanimous disappointment from this many readers towards a single book to be proven true; simple as that. For now, I really can’t recommend anyone to continue past . is easily the most disappointing final book of a series I’ve ever read. The disappointment was magnified because I utterly loved and I never read any series that began with 5 stars rating but concluded as low as 1.5 stars in the final installment. I’m so sorry, Anthony Ryan, but as a book reviewer, I must always be honest with my reviews.\n",

      "There is no other way to say this other than this book broke my heart. I have been disappointed before, but when I read the final page of Queen of Fire, I wanted to literally cry and I don’t mean that in a good way. I understand that endings are hard, especially in fantasy, but with Blood Song, the first book in this trilogy, Anthony Ryan created something special and although the second book in the series Tower Lord was a slight misstep , I still enjoyed it, but to say that Queen of Fire disappointed me would be the understatement of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the uninitiated, Queen of Fire picks up right after the ending of The Tower Lord. The United Realm has been invaded by the Empire of Volar, a sadistically evil nation who outwardly practices slavery and appeals to the worse base of human nature and cruelty. You think something is barbaric and cruel and dehumanizing, well the Volarians feel that is just the way of doing business. Not only are they evil, but they are ruled in the background by a dark and mysteriously powerful being termed the Ally who pulls the strings of the ruling council while also granting said members near immortality, mysterious abilities and wealth beyond their wildest dreams. At the start of our novel, the people of the United Realm have just crushed a large Volarian army at Alltor, the capital city for one of the provinces of the realm and are now making plans to remove the Volarians from their capital city Varinshold and the remainder of the realm while taking the fight to Volaria itself in order to ensure that the Volarians stay gone forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strength of the first book of this series, Blood Song lied in the characterization of the characters. Every character in that book felt unique, believable, and tangible and they spoke with their own voice. The characters all felt real and they grew organically into full-fledged human beings in their own right. The biggest example of this was Nortah, a character who was simply a jerk at the beginning of the Blood Song, but through the trials of the story transforms into one of the better characters of the series. If at the start of Blood Song, you would have told me that Nortah would become one of my favorite characters in the series and I would have never believed you. Fast Forward and contrast that with Queen of Fire, and there is almost no characterization between hardly any of the characters. Honestly, this phenomena is not entirely unique, as characterization died in this series with Tower Lord, but I digress. In Queen of Fire, every character speaks with almost the same voice and little is given to motivate their actions or why a character is doing anything. This is a problem, because there are A LOT of characters in this book, a lot of side characters as well as POV characters, and while not all the POV characters held my attention, the complete lack of character among any of the side characters made all of them readily forgettable and caused none of them to stand out. This in turn creates a scenario where you simply don’t care about any of the characters in the story, except maybe the main characters which leads to a case where an epic cast feels almost like cannon fodder or an afterthought. In this book, it felt like the characterization took a back page so that the author could focus more on his world building. That being said, I would highly advise that you reread Tower Lord before you pick up this book, as you will need a cheat sheet of sorts to keep track of who is who as you read the novel. This could have been alleviated somewhat if ever character felt unique, but among the minor characters you will have to work hard to keep track of who is who so you don’t feel lost.\n",

      "Vaelin Al Sorna, ostensibly the main character or the hero of the series, will go down as one of my favorite fantasy characters to ever grace the written page. However, his treatment in this novel is nothing short of a disaster. To put it mildly, Vaelin in the first two novels was a man that you did not want to cross, he was arguably the best swordsman alive and his Blood Song gave him nigh omniscient. In Queen of Fire, that is pretty much all gone, as he has lost his blood song, which would not be so bad, however, he has lost a lot of his ability to fight. Even though he regains both his confidence and his skills early in the novel, in my opinion the damage had already been done to the character and for me personally he lost a lot of his appeal, as his confidence and sure nature as well as his martial ability was what made him appealing to me in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Add to the fact that his POV chapters on the ice, were tedious to the extreme, incorporating a lot of walking, a lot of mysterious and foreboding innuendo all seemingly building up to a massive crescendo but in the end all being revealed in a gratuitous information dump. In retrospect, it was all a waste of time. However, the biggest sin of this trek was that while the rest of the United Realm was invading Volaria, ostensibly your main character is as far away as he can be from the action. At least in the Tower Lord, Vaelin, got a scene at the end where he was able to effectively break and end the siege of Alltor, but here he shows up at the end after all the fighting is said and done, he pulls another POV character aside, gives an info dump and then kills the main baddie in a totally pedestrian and utterly forgettable manner. It was extremely disappointing to say the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "That brings me two the villains in this novel. To label them mustache twirling villains would be an insult to the mustache twirling villains association of America. There is absolutely no sophistication to the villains in this book and even when they commit heinous actions it doesn’t come across as evil but as crazy or just simply incompetent. The Volarians are just evil with no redeeming qualities, and the two main baddies offer no sense of menace throughout the entire novel. Eleverah was interesting the in the Tower Lord, and the Ally was that all powerful force behind the throne of the most powerful nation on the planet, however circling back to the lack of characterization argument, both of these characters are relegated to cartoon villainy in this novel. Eleverah was showing signs of growth in the last book, but all that is thrown away here, as she is just sadistic, cruel, petty and in the most damning quality for a villain proved, she proved to be utterly incompetent. One could argue and the author does imply that she is patently insane, but still insane villains can often be unconventional, unpredictable and dangerous, of which Eleverah was none. It was so bad, that at the end, I found myself wondering, ok, maybe she is crazy like a fox and there is some great stratagem that she has cooked up that will make this final showdown great at the end. Nope, sorry, didn’t happen. Also the Ally, while his origins were cool, his motives were weak, and a lot of time was spent building up him as this great tool of death and destruction and then when you find out why he is so evil, you are like, really? That’s it? That’s all you got? *Sigh. Also, to be the big baddie in the series, he went out in the worst manner you can take out the main evil guy, it was fairly bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ahh, Volaria. Paper tigers of the world should stand up and take note, as this is how you create a paper tiger. The empire of Alpira, the nation invaded by our heroes in the first novel has been fighting Volaria for centuries, and Alpira wiped the floor with our heroes in the first novel. However, in this book, Volaria went down like a good old fashioned house of cards. The Empress Eleverah, pulled a trick here or there, but it never felt like the Realm was ever in any serious danger of losing even without the great Vaelin Al Sorna in the forefront. There was some talk with Frentis’s POV that, yeah invading these guys may not be a good idea, we will probably all die, but the Volarians never mounted a serious defense. The explanation given in the novel was that they essentially used up all of their best troops trying to invade the United Realm, and slave revolts where stripping their ability to field a decent army but this really was an anti-climactic way to set up a final war. This was utterly disappointing and robbed the novel of any tension or sense of danger in the novel. I never thought one of our heroes would die, even given the dour circumstances they were in, because the Volarians proved utterly incompetent to stop them.\n",

      "The list of disappointments could go on and on, Brother Caenis once again gets short treatment, although his character does get an interesting turn. Sherin does not show up yet again, which I found puzzling.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is some good in the novel however. Blood Song, and ostensibly the entire series could be a referendum on war and what it does to the powerless and those who fight it. That theme is carried on here throughout the novel as Ryan does a great job showing the visceral effects of the Volarian invasion on the United Realm while also showing the cost that liberation from said Volarians has on the Vox Populli, as well as the liberators. The book also raises the question of when in the process of revenge do you become as bad as the people you are reaping your vengeance upon? Does your cause remain righteous even when it causes you to do unrighteous things? The book also shows how the strong the idea of vengeance and even religious fervor can be whipped up by leaders to get a reluctant populace to stand up and fight a war even when their children may starve throughout the winter given the devastation of their homes. The psychological effect of killing is also shown rather well in the novel which was a nice touch. The battles of the novel are also extremely well written, as Ryan has a great idea how to write epic battle scenes whether they be on land or on sea. It also floats some interesting ideas about the origin of the religions throughout the nations in the novel but none of these ideas are really expounded upon. The novel does answer all the lingering questions in the series, but as I outlined above not everything is answered satisfactorily. The novel also does leave open the possibility of more stories to be shared in this world, which I also found intriguing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall though, this book was a supreme disappointment. Though extremely well written, I found parts of it tedious to read through, the characterization was rather poor and the villains were laughable with their worse crime being that they proved to be nonthreatening. I loved Blood Song, and in fact consider that novel one of my favorite books of all time, but Queen of Fire book broke my heart in the worst possible manner, in the end betraying all that I found dear about Blood Song. Excuse me while I go somewhere and cry some more.\n",

      "Now we have the third. For some reason Mr. Ryan seems to have simply let the story run on in different directions with little control of what's actually there. the view points bounce around from one to another with the story losing all direction at times, plot strings flailing out in all directions with very little relation (at times) to the original plot line(s).

The Enemy (or The Ally depending on where you are in the story) was in the end of the first novel the center of Vaelin's quest (so to speak). That focus has gone by the wayside. We do finally get back to it but oh the side roads, diatribes, wandering conversations, speeches, info dumps etc.\n",

Maybe he just wanted the story to go to a certain place and found he had to bend things and drag them out to get there. I have no idea how the book was edited.

      "~\n",
      "Ok, I've been informed that the person who looks like he's attacking Lynra at the end is actually Weaver and not some random assassin, and after reading both books again very carefully, I'm convinced that it is him. Also, there are quite a few mentions to a Queen of Fire, which may or may not be Lynra, although she is a Queen and she did survive an ordeal by fire, so she's a strong candidate for that. But the book implies that there isn't just one Queen of Fire, but many, as in there have been some in the past and will be some in the future as well, or at least that's how I read it.\n",

      "A lot of people think that the woman who kidnapped Frentis is the Queen of Fire and I admit this is a possibility, but I don't know, I just don't she's it. I think its Lyrna. The witch is the same thing that possessed Barkus and Dakova's sister. Or at least I think they're the same thing, you know, the souls in the Beyond that are wretched and want revenge and wear the skin of people. Anyway, in Blood Song, the thing in Barkus asks Vaelin, , and from this you kind of get the feeling that the Queen of Fire is an enemy whatever is inside Barkus. The first mention of a Queen of Fire is around half way through Blood song when Nersus Sil Nin mentions her to Vaelin: I believe that Vaelin would never serve the witch who many suspect is the Queen of Fire. So I'm guessing that the Queen of Fire isn't the witch woman, but Lynra, because to be honest, I don't think the witch is important enough to warrant a whole book named after her, whereas Lynra is. She totally is. She is one kick ass independent smart praise worthy character who totally warrants a book named after her.

There were too many POV's, and while I did admit that it worked in Tower Lord, that only worked because of the fact that the plot was still interesting, there were some likeable characters, and Vaelin's awesomeness. Sadly, none of these were present in this book. Reva was never really that interesting to begin with, I'm not sure why Frentis still has his own POV in this book, Lyrna has ceased to be an interesting, complex, sharp and intelligent character that she was in the first two books, and Vaelin...oh Vaelin.

I knew it would be hard for him to accept the loss, since he was grown very reliant on his song to give him guidance and strength. But never would I expect him to cease to be interesting and awesome. To be fair, I don't think this newfound boring aspect of his character can be entirely attributed to the loss of his blood song. The ending of Tower Lord was very very satisfying in the fact that Vaelin totally and completely PWNED Volarian ass, thus showcasing Vaelin's swordsmanship and general awesomeness. And I guess it would be hard to amp up the drama and awesome in the third book considering that he did at the end of the second.

Most of the time she was appointing random people to random royal positions rinse and repeat this speech about 10 more times. And I'm not sure about how I feel when Weaver healed her burns and returned her good looks. I kind of like some insecurity in her. Some flaw in her perfect facade that made her more human- some sort of reminder of the trails that she went through. Speaking of healing her burns, isn't this book called for a reason? And wasn't there subtle references to a 'Queen of Fire' in ? And so it comes as a complete surprise to me when there isn't really any queen of fire. There is a queen. There is lots of fire. From the title and the plot, I assume that Lynra is supposed to be the Queen of Fire, but nowhere in the book is she really explicitly called by that name.

But then happened and it was as if Lynra and him are strangers to each other: awkward and unsure. The Shield (who proclaimed his willingness to follow her anywhere in the previous book), suddenly develops resentment towards Lyrna's regard for Vaelin and for some reason decided to give up on her? WTF? Is this even the same guy from the previous books? The most promising couple in this series turned out to not even be a couple...\n",

These ships have not only sailed, but been ransacked by pirates and then burned and are now at the bottom of the deepest ocean where it is home to crustaceans and the occasional school of fish.

      "**Potential Spoilers**\n",
      "I thought the plot and a few of the characters (in particular Clarissa, Miss Mary, and Theodora) were interesting in theory. However, I thought the writing seemed amateurish and very stiff. The dialogue wasn't natural at all. Often times, the dialogue was so thick and confusing it was difficult to remember who was talking. I also thought the ending seemed rushed unnecessarily. She focused in great detail on certain aspects of the plot which didn't matter much (like the execution of the will), but then rushed through a few major plot points, which I won't name specifically here, but that occur on the last few pages of the book. I wasn't surprised to read after the fact that this was a first novel by a former attorney. That explained the tone and the oddly unnecessary legal details. In general, this seemed to me to be a great first draft, but should have run through a few more edits before being published.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This book is so bad it's hilarious. It's told almost completely in dialogue, which is annoying even when done by the best of authors. No one ever in the history of the world talks like anyone in this book. The ending actually made me laugh out loud. I shan't spoil it for you, but suffice it to say that the \"surprise twist\" is indeed a surprise, because it very much appears as though it was was a complete afterthought. There is not one thing the preceding pages which makes the \"surprise\" make any sense whatsoever. I cannot recommend this book. Ever. To anyone. For any reason. Just take my word for it and keep right on looking for something else to read.\n",

      "The Wedding Gift is an interesting read. Its very depressing but it wasnt a hard read. Usually when I read a book about slavery its a difficult read and I struggle to finish those books. But The Wedding Gift was compulsively readable. I almost couldn't put it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way in which The Wedding Gift was interesting was the pov's. This book had 2 pov's, Sarah Campbell a young slave girl and Theodora Allen the wife of the slave owner. It was super fascinating to see slavery through the eyes of a slave and through the eyes of a slaver. Both women were sympathetic in their own ways and unsympathetic as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only real downside I found with this book was, that the storylines were a bit predictable. The book ends with 2 \"twists\" that had been super obvious to me the second they were introduced. I also felt this book lack heart, but I viewed that as both good and bad. Usually books about slavery tend to be \"misery porn\" which I hate. They play on our heartstrings or our sense of moral outrage. But The Wedding Gift didn't do that. It was written in a more cerebral way. It wasnt trying to rub the misery of slavery in our faces. The author of this book assumes you already know how awful slavery and she just precedes with her story.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I love historical fiction novels as I truly believe all of us, regardless of what time period we walked the earth, are similar at the core. This was a great account of how women, both slave and non-slave, were manipulated and treated back in the day. While, I have been fortunate to live in a time period of equality, and I have, clearly, never been a slave, I can relate to the emotions a lot of the characters felt: revenge, sadness, a love for family, and the will to survive. The ending shocked me, and at first I hated it, but then I learned a powerful lesson: not to judge the actions of others as you have not lived their life. What would I do in the situation she was in? I have reflected on that and asked myself over the past few days, and any book that gets you thinking and questioning your believes and your life is a good book, in my opinion.\n",

I got this book for free on Kindle and it was everything I look for in a book. the suspense was great and when you are finally aware of the curveball the author throws she throws you another. I really didn't want to put this book down and wouldn't have if it wasn't for class! great for anyone who loves historical fiction.\n",

      "Having now received an answer from Audible, I have been informed that the basis for the Blackstone audiobook is the University of Pennsylvania edition published in 1994. This edition, and thus the audiobook too, restores those portions removed from the author’s text with the book's first publication by Harper & Brothers in 1911. The audiobook is thus Dreiser's original text before Harper & Brothers' modifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having now read three of 's novels, I am struck by the similarity of the books’ messages as well as their prose style. Dreiser belongs to the school of American naturalists. They are realists to the core. They look at society with a critical eye. Dreiser writes of the harsh reality of life at the turn of the 19th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Often, authors of this school are criticized for their emphasis of the darker aspects of life. I would counter this view with the observation that Dreiser’s novels portray protagonists who succeed, social restrictions, the stumbling blocks put in their paths and their so-called lack of moral strength. It is true that events are not drawn in an idealistic fashion. I see real life and people willing to fight against poor odds. One must ask, “Morals according to whom?” The incongruence between moral strength and the morals dictated by society is the hallmark of Dreiser’s work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dreiser’s prose style is clear, crisp, exact, spare. These are the adjectives that come to mind. The writing is without melodrama or theatrics. The telling is plot-oriented and with little dialog. Readers watch what happens and find themselves caught up in the moral dilemma lying at the core of the novel. The absence of hysteria is not only refreshing, but also strengthens readers’ focus on the central issue. Histrionics, sobs and moans and soppy revelations would only distract. For me, the spare simplicity of the lines gives strength and puts emphasis on what is being said.\n",
      "\n",
      "This novel critiques the institution of marriage, organized religion, social restrictions, wealth and the means by which money is often attained. The essence of love, what love gives and what it demands is a central theme too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story focuses on Jennie Reinhardt, her five siblings and her mother and father. It opens in 1880, Columbus Ohio. Jennie is eighteen. Life is a struggle against poverty. The story follows her entire life and her moves within the Midwest. What will one do to survive and what is required to succeed are the questions asked. What is necessary to retain one’s integrity and is it possible to remain morally upright?\n",
      "\n",
      "The audiobook is very well narrated by Lloyd James. The narrator never gets between the listener and the story. One listens to the words. The focus is on the one reading the story. This I very much like.\n",

      "My loins were girded. I've read Sister Carrie and books by Frank Norris and William Dean Howells, books and authors of the Realism/Naturalism schools. In other words, authors who show you that life is crap, people are crap and all you can expect is crap. Not that the books are crap - they can be very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in this uncharitable (but realistic!) frame of mind I was very surprised by the curve ball Dreiser throws in \"Jennie Gerhardt\". There is not one ogre in the book nor is it a tale of a spiraling down into degradation (, ). In reality it is a love story where capitalism takes the role of the Montagues and Capulets keeping the star-cross'd lovers apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dreiser is the opposite of . If ever they were in the same room together I imagine a conversation where James is constantly demurring, obliquely not-saying what he's trying to say while Dreiser is constantly interrupting \"What? What? Spit it out man!\" Dreiser is continually burrowing in to the characters and situations, analyzing and describing to give us complete picture of the \"way things are\". Jamesian innuendo it is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one place where he couldn't be explicit is due to the sexual mores of literature at the time - i.e. he couldn't explicitly say that Jennie and her two sugar-daddies are doing it - he had to drop the hint very strongly. He had to make sure we got the point because the novel would be meaningless without it. In a crude Marxian analysis, Jennie's incredible hotness was her rare material and her labor (so to speak) - however Men had the means of production. Jennie's class and status as mistress made her an outcast, regardless of her beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The character of Lester Kane, Jennie's love, is a latter-day Hamlet. He knows what the right thing to do is (marry Jennie), but he cannot do it because that would mean a loss of *something*. At first the loss was his independence, then it would be because he doesn't \"love\" her (but he did, he just didn't know it - a situation much mined by later Romance novelists I hear), and finally he would lose his inheritance if he stayed with Jennie. Here is where the class struggle struggles into the novel - Dreiser explicitly mentions a number of times in the text that these two were just victims of faceless systems and circumstances, that love ain't got nothin' to do with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some ways the purest joys in reading the novel is in the in depth way Dreiser shows us how society was in those days, from the poorest immigrant to the richest capitalist. Every class had their social anxieties and protocols and to violate them was to be an outcast. In particular interest to me was the depiction of the Gerhardt family in their German Lutheran society - where the insular Lutheran flock is ruled by the minister. Luther may have got rid of the bishops and the pope - but he didn't get rid of male authority, not by a long shot!\n",

      "Theodore Dreiser (1871-1945) é considerado o mais influente escritor do naturalismo dos Estados Unidos. Não sendo muito apreciado pelo estilo, é valorizado pela construção de personagens, que refletem o estilo de vida, na época, da sociedade norte-americana.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jenny Gerhardt é uma jovem que nasceu numa família muito pobre. É bela, generosa e ingénua; defeitos que a tornam uma tentação para os homens. Quase toda a sua vida é um calvário de sofrimento; pela rejeição do pai; pela perda dos amantes; pela morte dos seres queridos.\n",
      "É um romance interessante por reflectir as desigualdades sociais e a mentalidade da época, em que um homem da alta sociedade não pode casar com uma mulher humilde. Hoje, acho, que ainda é assim; o que mudou é as mulheres já não serem expulsas de casa por perderem a virgindade e a sociedade não as criticarem ou rejeitarem.\n",
      "Apesar de tanto drama, não me comovi nem um bocadinho; não sei se o devo ao estilo de Dreiser, ou se à tradução miserável.\n",
      "\n",
      "Não costumo dar importância a pormenores de má tradução, mas este romance é um caso especial. Nunca li um livro com tantos erros de ortografia e de construção gramatical. Até o título está errado; é certo que Jenny Gerhardt não casou, mas isso não é motivo para perder o nome...\n",

      "I love nothing like I love a taboo love story. So, it is no big surprise that this book had been sitting on my TBR for quite some time. Finally, I decided to download the audiobook and give it a listen. I am so glad that I did. This book was incredible!\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, let me say that it was not the dirty, sordid affair that I had envisioned in my perverted mind. Yes, there is the obvious taboo nature of a student-teacher affair. However, it was almost easy to forget that that relationship dynamic existed. They just fit together so well, that there wasn't the obvious power differential that you'd expect in a student-teacher relationship. This was probably due, in part, to the fact that their ages were so close together.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Daniel, aka Mr. Daniels, actually meets Ashlyn outside of school without knowing that she was a student at the high school where he teaches. At only 22 years old, he might be the youngest high school teacher in history. Likewise, at 19 years old, Ashlyn is an anomaly as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Needless to say, a 22 year-old and 19 year-old don't feel quite as taboo as a forty-something and an underage teen. So, as much as I love a naughty, salacious story, that wasn't what ended up being the draw for this story. It was just a sweet, heartwarming love story, with a touch of the forbidden.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to give too much of this story away, but I will say that both of these characters had tons of baggage. They were both so broken, that it was difficult to watch. Finding each other was their saving grace. I don't think that anyone else would have been able to \"get through\" to either of these characters. It was meant to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The supporting characters were also superb. I loved Hailey and Ryan. Even Ashlyn's deadbeat dad, Henry, won me over eventually. The backstories were engaging and enlightening, helping to move things along and highlight significant facets of their lives.\n",

I truly loved it but in the interest of full honesty, I’ll say that it wasn’t perfect for me. As I read, I felt myself fall in love with the story but then there’d be moments (more in the first half of the book) when I’d drift away from my connection a little, only to then be drawn back in … and I did make note of a few things that bothered me while I was reading but now that I’ve finished my read and I’m looking back on it, the only things that stand out to me are the positive things that I loved so I’m just going to say that while this book wasn’t perfect, I still completely loved it and highly recommend it for everyone.\n",

      "Few people do training story arcs like Masashi Kishimoto. Sure, for the longest time it seemed like Yoshihiro Togashi of Yu Yu Hakusho fame was the shonen manga-ka most (in)famous for his training arcs, which were usually very long and very multi-layered, but recently Kishimoto has shown us what he can really do with some age-old genre tropes, and what comes out of all of this is volume fifty-three of Naruto, in which Naruto fights himself and then fights inside himself, only to find some unexpected assistance from a character I did not expect to see return any time soon. This volume is not so much the birth of Naruto – though it is that too – as much as the rebirth of Naruto, in which he embraces who he truly is and uses it to his own advantage in some incredible character growth that is much needed after what seemed like volumes of the young man struggling with his own self-identity. In short, if you are a fan of the series' title orange-clad character, this is a volume of Naruto to marvel and enjoy and possible get a bit teary over.\n",

      "Regarding the three prohibitions of the shinobi, Kushina should've been more concerned about her son falling for toxic male Uchihas than random girls. No, seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't have much to say about Naruto meeting Kushina. It was as amazing and emotional as it was in the anime, and that should tell us a lot about Kishimoto's skills as a writer (and his wife's skills as an advisor), since manga panels don't have any of the additional elements of the anime adaptation (the voice acting, renditions, and of course, Yasuharu Takanashi's magnificent soundtrack). Kushina herself was an amazing character, from her sudden and quite epic entrance, to her bittersweet departure. Can we also talk about how OP her jutsu is? We've seen Nagato, and of course, Naruto in action, but she's the very first Uzumaki that actually showed us what her clan is truly capable of (albeit rather briefly)-no wonder they were wiped out, they must've been monsters. ...\n",
      "\n",
      "There's almost always a 'but' with Kishimoto's volumes. While Kushina's final words for Naruto and Minato's 'ditto' (he had one job, and he couldn't even do the bare minimum) were emotional and quite heavy, their deaths were actually pointless, and kinda dumb. Why? Because -spoilers ahead- they could've simply sealed Nine Tails back inside Kushina. During the incoming War Arc, they do that with Naruto and it's all fine. Just like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a number of ways to explain why neither Kushina nor Minato think about just doing that, the most obvious one being the fact that their deaths and Naruto's status as a Jinchuriki are two already established events that no retcon to the plot could change. It's just a flashback, but one that is heavily driven by plot. A plot that is dumb due to Minato's reasons to die for his son. Kushina's intention was to take down Nine Tails with her, so she was probably going to re-seal him inside her... which would have had resulted in her not dying. Again, a big issue when we're 53 volumes in a story about her orphaned son. So how did Kishimoto fix that? By having Minato utter some nationalist nonsense and use a jutsu that would kill him, and therefore prevent his wife from literally saving herself.\n",

      "The only real flaw in this densely plotted page-turner of a novel is that in the end it slightly disappoints because it promises more than it delivers. It makes the reader fall in love with its plain but resourceful heroine Marian Halcombe, and teases us with the delightful prospect that she will become the principal agent bringing the villains to justice. When, in the middle of the novel, Marian tells her half-sister Laura that \"our endurance must end, and our resistance begin,\" it seems like a groundbreaking feminist principle, and a little later Collins gives us the perfect metaphor for liberation when Marian divests herself of much of her cumbersome Victorian clothing so that she may safely climb out on a roof to eavesdrop on her enemies.\n",
      "\n",
      "But--alas!--she is soaked by the rain, becomes ill, and--after having been removed to the ancient Gothic wing of the estate to recuperate--she returns to the plain woman's typical Victorian role of loyal sister and adoring aunt, allowing the returning hero Walter Hartwright to tie up the loose ends of the plot. Nevertheless, the intricate resolution is absorbing (even if the last hundred pages seem too crowded and rushed) and the ending (although perhaps too pat) is satisfying.\n",

      "7. Shutting yourself up in a medieval vestry full of combustible materials with a candle for lighting is NOT advisable. Always have your minions do the dirty work.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Being ‘feeble in mind’ is enough reason to get you committed into an asylum for the mentally ill. So is knowing some secret that you might accidentally blurt out to strangers.\n",

      "9. You CAN marry someone who is legally dead. Nobody bothered to check the civil registry records in those good old days.\n",

      "Lately, I have received several personal messages that accused me, based on point#1 in my review above, of being prejudiced toward Italians --- something which couldn't be further from the truth. For those who hold such view, I would like to point out that my review is a parody which involves humorous, satiric or ironic imitations of the plot, characters or point of views set forth in the novel.The \"This is what I learned\" heading is a part of the whole exercise, and does not mean that I personally subscribe to the points enumerated therein. Obviously, I don't believe that \"intelligent, resourceful women are likely to be mannish, and even actually HAVE a mustache\" (point 6) or that \"being ‘feeble in mind’ is enough reason to get you committed into an asylum for the mentally ill\" (point 8) --- just as I don't believe that \"Italians are excitable, dedicated to the opera, and most likely to be involved with organized crime\".\n",

      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "DON'T READ THIS BOOK, unless you've got the patience, stamina, and requisite taste for a quintessential mid-Victorian novel. If you don't, you'll think The Woman in White is terribly overwrought and 500 pages too long. If you like Victorian writing, you'll think this is a well-drawn, balanced novel with characters to root for, characters to despise, a twisting plot that rolls up seamlessly, and narrated ingeniously from multiple points of view. If you're unsure whether you like or dislike Victorian writing, this book is an outstanding introductory choice, and it's one that I recommend unreservedly, to you and to my friends. Some facts in its favor: it was considered the first English sensation novel of the psychological mystery genre, has been continuously in print for 150 years, has a 4+ star rating from over 5700 Goodread reviews, and was written by a guy named Wilkie.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most prominent, intrinsic hurdle of is the writing. If you haven't had exposure to authors such as Charles Dickens, Henry James, Victor Hugo, the Bronte sisters, Oliver Wendell Holmes, then you haven't been tested by fire with the length and circuitousness of Victorian writing. It could take a page or paragraph to describe how a character moved. It's at once beautiful, savory, complete, and exact. However, readers may complain that it's simply unnecessary verbiage. I'll give you an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This could be easily rewritten as: If this was, in fact, how it was written, then the story would be 200 pages and selling as a cheap, mass-market paperback best read on a beach vacation. No, we read novels like first and foremost because of the writing--the convoluted but balanced thought, the investigation of intent from multiple sides, the uber-descriptive narrative that doesn't rest. If your thoughts tend to regurgitate and grind on situations that occur to you throughout the day, then you understand and enjoy this type of lilting writing that revisits a topic over and over again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I find myself rereading with amazement and pleasure the skill of word and sentence placement. I think with a smirk what it'd be like today if we talked like this to each other: Fantastic--not my writing--but the idea that we English speakers once talked like this, and could again if we read nothing but Victorian novels. I'd like to try a couple months with language like this around and about town today.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite character, by a whimper, was Mr. Fairlie. What a pansy. But, written so humorously, each time he entered a scene my reaction was, \"Oh geez, what ailment now.\" Mr. Hartwright was a sleuthing superstar, and since he predates Sherlock Holmes, I see a lot of similarity between the two, and can't help but wonder if Sir Arthur Conan Doyle based his character on Mr Hartwright. The team of Count Fosco and Percival Glyde were deeply written and their greed, bombast, and evil were delectable to the last. If anyone has read by Ken Follet, tell me if I'm wrong to see a striking similarity between Follet's evil duo and Collins' team of Fosco and Glyde. Follet's portrayal of greed and evil fell flat, whereas Collins left you silently rooting for Fosco's escape. There's a few small problems with , but they're perfectly Victorian, yet personal peeves. For example, can a woman swoon from bad news and take months to recover? Can a person die from a broken heart? Small issues in a such a tightly woven story.\n",

Hartright is still reeling from her ghostly appearance out of the gloom and dark of night, made more dramatic by her pale apparel. Before he can assemble his thoughts, she is in a carriage being spirited away. Men appear quickly behind her, whom he soon learns are chasing her. Hartright makes every effort to catch up with her to offer her further assistance, but does not find her.\n",

      "Hartright is left with a mystery, but will soon discover that this mystery will become an obsession as the woman in white proves inexplicably to be tied to the woman he will fall in love with. He takes a job as a drawing master, instructing two half sisters as different as night and day. One is fair, and one is dark. One is pretty, and one is...well...unattractive. The word ugly is actually used, but once I learn of Marian Halcombe’s character, it is impossible to associate such a hideous word to such a lovely person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marian is brave, brilliant, and resourceful. In my opinion, one of the most interesting and fascinating women to appear in a Victorian novel. She becomes the pillar of strength for her sister, as well as for Hartright, as they are inescapably bound together against the machinations of men intent upon their destruction. Marian, we soon learn, can hold her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hartright, of course, falls in love with Laura Fairlie, the fair and beautiful one, an heiress, an orphan, a woman in need of protecting. Unfortunately, fate has conspired against them. She is promised to another one, the odious Sir Percival Glyde. Glyde is in serious financial trouble and needs her fortune to keep his creditors from dismantling his estate brick by brick. His closest friend is an Italian named Count Fosco, who conspires with him in a most insidious plot to take everything from Laura including, quite possibly, her own life.\n",

He does love and respect Marian, but never sees her as a potential mate, even after he discovers that Laura will soon be unattainable. It is only a small disappointment. We all see ourselves from a very young age married to someone beautiful or handsome. Hartright, whose heart is always in the right place, is attracted to Laura’s beauty, but also to her vulnerability. Marian is neither pretty nor is she helpless.\n",
      "\n",
      "The twist and turns to the plot are wonderfully revealed. This is considered one of the first detective novels as Hartright does apply investigative methods to his research while attempting to thwart the plans of Glyde and Fosco. Wilkie Collins’s background in studying the law also becomes readily apparent at different stages of the novel. The writing style is true Victorian style. I must caution you: if you are not a fan of Charles Dickens or Anthony Trollope, you might find this novel difficult.\n",

      "I read the book mostly late at night with the fireplace crackling and popping next to me. The wind has been blowing steadily the last few days, and as it moved along the gutters and through the bushes outside my window, it created sounds that made me snuggle deeper into my reading chair and feel as much as possible as if I were in England in the 1850s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collins does explore the idea of women’s rights. The law does not protect their rights in near the same fashion that it protects a man’s rights. A woman truly had to live by her wits to keep from being marginalized by the complete and nearly unassailable power of her husband or her father. Marian was a match for any man, but she needed much more than her intelligence to outflank the injustice and the discrimination under which she was forced to live.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collins was a bohemian who did not believe in marriage. He had no qualms about living with more than one lover at once. I’m sure Dickens marvelled at his ability to pull of this feat in such a conservative time period. They were good friends, Dickens and Collins, but there was a break in their friendship towards the end of Dickens’ life when he was working on the novel , I can’t think that Dickens was jealous. He was the champion among writers at the time. Collins fell out of favor over time while Dickens’ books soared. Only recently has Collins started to be regarded as one of the important Victorian writers.\n",

      "Written in 1859-60 by William \"Wilkie\" Collins and originally published in serial form in Charles Dickens' magazine (Wilkie and Charles were good friends), The Woman in White is considered one of the earliest examples of detective fiction, though it's really just the better part of the second half of this book that has any real detecting going on. Before that you have to wade through star-crossed love and the heroine acting all self-sacrificing (<---very bad idea, at least in this case). There's quite a bit of Victorian melodrama and some eyebrow-raising coincidences, but also some unforgettable characters and some intense suspense in the second half.\n",

Laura is lovely, quiet and timid (and also, BTW, bears a startling resemblance to the mysterious woman in white); Marian has a singularly unattractive face but a charming, outgoing personality. Guess which one Walter falls for? And Laura loves him too, though they never speak of it, except to Marian.\n",

She marries her baronet, Sir Percival Glyde, figuring, I guess, that she might as well, and he's always been kind to her.\n",

      "After the marriage - which quickly goes south since Glyde only married Laura for her money, and has no interest in being nice to her once they're married - strange things start to happen. Glyde wants Laura to sign papers (she still has control of her fortune) but won't show her what she's signing, hiding everything except the line where she's supposed to sign. Even in Victorian times, that's pretty alarming for the lady involved.\n",

The novel had a few parts that were long-winded and/or sentimental in that distinctively Victorian kind of way, and (also typical of older books) there are a lot of stereotypes. For instance, the women tend to faint or get ill rather than be tough and useful, although Marian is generally an exception to that rule. But the story really sucked me in the further I got into it. Marian and Count Fosco are truly unique and memorable characters. Identity is a recurring theme, for the villains as well as some of the main characters, as are hidden secrets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I especially liked the quasi-investigative structure of the novel, with narration by multiple characters, each with his or her own distinctive voice and point of view. The kind-hearted, loyal Walter; Marian, writing in her diary; Laura's whiny invalid uncle, who just wants to be left alone and is of no help to Laura in her trials; the prideful Count Fosco, weaving his plans; a couple of servants: all of them get their turn explaining their part of the events in this book. I thought that was really well done. As a lawyer, I found the lawyer's description of marriage settlements particularly interesting, along with the negotiations between him (acting for Laura) and Sir Percival's lawyer. And when he says, and then repeats, \"No daughter of mine should have been married to any man alive under such a settlement as I was compelled to make for Laura Fairlie,\" it was a chilling moment.\n",

      "este libro para mi fue una salvación. siempre he pensado que al leer libros empezamos a vivir otra vida, una vida en común con todas las personas que lo han leído, pero cada quien la vive diferente. los libros nos dejan un mensaje, ya está en cada uno el tomarlo y aprovecharlo o dejarlo. este libro en lo particular lo leí cuando estaba pasando por una etapa muy difícil de mi vida. menciono toda clase de preocupación que el ser humano puede tener y hace que nos demos cuenta como en realidad no hay problema sin salida, solo personas sin ganas de salir. habla de lo fácil que en realidad es la vida pero lo difícil que cada uno decide hacersela. también me hizo amar la vida, amar lo que me rodea y darme cuenta que no es mío, si no que todo lo que esta aquí en la tierra es prestado, no somos dueños de nada ni de nosotros mismos. no hay decisión cuyo fin sea para siempre mas que la muerte, y esa precisamente es la única que no está en nuestras manos. recomiendo este libro ampliamente. logra hacernos sentir como si lo estuviéramos viviendo, crea un acercamiento con Dios que es el pilar de mi vida y en quien yo tengo depositada toda mi confianza. este libro fue mágico para mi y me gustaría que así como a mi me sirvió a ustedes también.\n",

      "Re-read April 2021. Ishat still rocks. If you haven't read Gedge, you shouldl.\n",

      "Re-Read March 2013 - Really good character study. Ishat rocks.\n",

      "I discovered Pauline Gedge eight years during a trip to Montreal. I brought Child of the Morning and loved it. This book, The Twice Born is her best work to date.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book does not have much physical action, so if you are in the mood for battles between huge armies, this book doesn't have it. What this book does, and does well, is offer a mediation on fate. Huy is the twice born. He died and came back. He can now see into the future and commune with the Egyptian gods. Huy, however, would rather live a normal life. Gedge offers us a fated character and how he comes to term with his fate. The book includes discussion about belief, about fate, and about being true to yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gedge does an excellent job painting ancient Egypt for the reader. The reader gets a good feel for the time and place. All of Gedge's characters live and move. No character is too similar and all seem to be nice layered.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I must admit, I think part of the reason why it has taken me so long to get to this book, despite thoroughly enjoying all of Pauline Gedge’s previous works, is that I’ve been saving it. The King’s Man trilogy is Gedge’s latest and as of yet last set of books, so I’ve been reluctant to crack it open, knowing that it will likely be the last time I get that sense of wondrous discovery from an author I rank among my top three.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some reason, I previously had the mistaken impression that this trilogy was set during the reign of Ramesses II. It isn’t. I don’t know why I thought that. It’s set during the reigns of Djehutymes III, Amunhotep II, Djehutymes IV, and Amunhotep III: the blurb says so, and the protagonist, Huy, is even referenced off-screen in Gedge’s fourth novel, . However, this isn’t straight up historical fiction. Gedge is mostly known the straight historical novel, but she has dabbled in the past with historical fantasy in , also known as , and she does so again here. Huy really does have powers of prophecy. And yet it still feels like more of a historical than a fantasy. Appearance of the fantasy elements are confined to necessity in advancing the plot, and in all other respects the book’s world operates by real life rules. Gedge, as is her wont, pours lavish detail of ancient Egyptian culture, society, and life into her novel, creating a thoroughly historical and accurate backdrop amidst which the fantastical events proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Huy is also one of the few non-royal characters that Gedge has ever written about. Khaemwaset in is at least a prince, and Thu from starts as a commoner but marries into royalty. This is the first time that Gedge has charted the career of an entirely non-royal character, and my reading of the book certainly links together that fact with a slight shift in writing style. Although Gedge has always been notable for her attention to detail, the focus on daily life for ordinary Egyptians has a new intensity here. And in the absence of gripping political drama and thrilling battle scenes, she dives deep into ancient Egyptian theological thought. It’s a fascinating exploration of an area which has heretofore been persistently in the background of Gedge’s other ancient Egyptian novels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because I’ve been re-reading several of Gedge’s books this year and as an author she is just so consistently good at producing quality work, I know full well I am repeating similar sentiments, but it must be said once again: Gedge’s writing is sublime. Her characterisations are thoughtful and nuanced, her world-building is vivid, and her use of language is engaging and creative. I’ve been wracking my mind for negatives in this book, and I could come up with only one. Huy as a child, along with some of his peers, are far more articulate than I would expect given their young ages. But even this isn’t a negative that truly bothers me, because it means I am spared from having to endure simplified, babyish dialogue during the section encompassing his childhood and adolescence.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s plenty of drama in this first book in the trilogy, but the story ends with Huy on the cusp of a challenge of greatest magnitude yet, and I am eager to pick up the next instalment.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "- Minor spoilers ahead -\n",
      "\n",
      "This book can be mediocre or brilliant depending on what you really need in historical fiction. The author has certainly taken up the story of an interesting personality. Unlike most of the historical fiction centred in ancient Egypt, this one is not about a royal personality, but about the son of a lowly farmer, who goes on to become a powerful man, and even had temples built for him and was worshipped as a direct link to Amun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Huy is a peasant boy in Egypt living under the reign of Amunhotep III. His fond and rich uncle, Ker, decides to sponsor his education at the temple in Iunu. Things were going well for Huy and he was looking forward to the life of a scribe, when tragedy struck. One of the students in the school 'killed' him, but Amun gave life back to Huy - along with a gift. He could now prophesy and heal. This is when Huy's life changes remarkably and he tries to flee from his ultimate destiny as a tool of the gods. This story is all about his struggle with himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best thing about this book is that it draws you right inside ancient Egypt and keeps you there. Extremely well researched, Gedge brings no weird modernisms into the story. These characters inhabit an ancient world and that is how they think and behave. From the food to the daily ablutions, every detail of life in small-town Eighteenth Dynasty Egypt was depicted. If this is your primary interest in historical fiction, you would love this book. And indeed, Gedge is to be commended for her details and her research!\n",
      "\n",
      "But story-telling is a completely different matter. Everything is seen from Huy's eyes, and hence the motivations of other characters are unknown. This ultimately means that the other characters are severely underdeveloped. One example is Anuket, who overnight turns from a quiet young girl to a manipulative woman. Her manipulation was also not obvious to me at all, and except for everyone calling her that, there is absolutely nothing to show her as a bad person who would have made her husband unhappy. The same thing happens with Sennefer. He randomly establishes an enmity with Huy, which goes to the extent of killing him. I think this deserved more exploration of his thoughts and feelings!\n",
      "\n",
      "For reading this book, you have to suspend disbelief. Gedge treats god as real and has Huy genuinely go into trances and predicting future. She also has the gods talking to him, and he is able to heal through their intervention. All this in a story that is supposedly about a real man who existed takes a lot of effort to get into. But you mostly do, because of the excellent detailing.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most boring parts of the book was when Huy is deciphering the Book of Thoth. The author just has him ruminate and ponder the cryptic sayings over and over again. I was not interested in the philosophy and neither was I interested in Huy's thought process while trying to decipher the Book. This part was really not fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, despite all the problems, was a very compelling read. It is not easy to write a fictional biography of a person about whom not much is known. Gedge's knowledge of this period in time is excellent and all you need to do is go with the flow.\n",

      "\n",
      "The book is a tedious read, made so in part because it has many, many more pages than it needs. It is repetitive in many parts, I mean really, do I need to read the discussion each time of the dozens of times someone eats goat cheese and bread or greens with slices of garlic and onion? I adamantly say NO. Unfortunately, Gedge seems to think yes. There are many examples of this disagreement between me and this author throughout the book.\n",

      "\n",
      "Still another pet peeve of mine: I hate it when the female characters exist almost entirely to fulfill roles of mother and lover and potential lover. OK, in this one they also get to be servant, but that is not better. It is, again, made worse because in one case she gets to pretend to be 'mentor' but behaves as 'mother' and in another gets to pretend to be 'friend' but is essentially 'potential lover' and 'servant'. Blargh! I hate it when authors think I am an idiot. As if I believe any of this pretending. Granted, what could I expect? With a protagonist is two-dimensional and unrealistic, how could I expect the supporting cast of characters to do any better, especially the women, who fared worst of all?\n",
      "\n",
      "Gedge writes all of my pet peeves and more and it is as irritating in this book as it is in any other, made worse because this book is more than 450 pages of it, almost nonstop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I immensely disliked the protagonist Huy. He is a self-entitled, whiny, selfish, arrogant, [insert word here the GR would censor]. And, all of the moaning and groaning and feeling badly, and more often trying to justify, the hubris of his thoughts and actions read as shallow and fake as the rest of this character. By the end of the book I hated this character. My loathing for Huy was problematic because the book is so focused on him that there was no escape. And, in Gedge's repetitive style, the reader gets to hear all of Huy's thoughts before he makes a choice or takes an action, the narrative of him enacting the choice or action, the thoughts he is having while making the choice or action, the discussions he has with others about the choice or action, and then his thoughts about the results of the particular choice or action. EVERY time Huy makes a thought or action, from putting on sandals (or not) to whether or not he will move across the country. Did that last little bit of my review seem tedious, poorly written, and repetitive? Try it for 450+ pages in this book, only with less conciseness of writing and more annoyance about the character - that is this book in a nutshell. BLARGH!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I wanted to like this book much more than I did. I tried to give it two stars, but by the end of this review, I realized that I cannot. Two is for 'it is OK'. One is for 'did not like it'. I go beyond 'not liking' into hating this book. So one star it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will read no more books in this series, and no more by this author. There are too many good books out there and even potentially good books out there for me to pursue ones that are as irritating as this.\n",

      "What to make of Love Me Back? It's a novel that asks not necessarily to be liked but to be reckoned with. It has some scorchingly good writing for a debut. While Marie, a Dallas waitress, feels less like a fully formed character and more of a vessel for all of the service industry's drugs and sex and racism and awful men to be dumped into, she's still deftly drawn. She almost tragically embraces the role she's fallen into; she's a sharp and brilliant observer of those around her but also someone who courts pain; promiscuity is an easy and reliable course of existence, her fellow restaurant workers a kind of perverted family. She can't be a proper, present mother to her young daughter, even though Marie's love for her is tenderly portrayed; she can't appreciate the seeming goodness of her ex-husband, who impregnated her on a church mission in high school. When she's working, it's a performance, and she often self-destructively chooses not to end that performance once she leaves the restaurant. To think of the number of men she sleeps with is like imagining the progress of the national debt clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the acknowledgments, Tierce--a former waitress, Iowa MFA grad and already a celebrated writer--thanks a fellow author for convincing her that her \"restaurant stories\" were a larger book. But this isn't really a novel; the shock of the writing and Marie's behavior is unsettling enough, but that the format of that \"larger book\" never quite congeals into a sustained narrative helped unnerve me even more. It's a brutally perfect way of conveying Marie's dissociative existence, throughout which she keeps her \"dignity separate, somewhere else, attached to different things.”\n",

      "Boy, this was gritty. It made me blush, which is pretty hard to do. I love Palahniuk, so this should have been a cake-walk. In truth, it was but I could see SO many readers turn away from this book due to the language and sleazy situations. As dirty as this book is, the truth is... so is real life (especially in the foodservice industry). This novel should be read as a warning as to what life can give you and how you should avoid the crap (a don't end up like this! cautionary tale). We all know someone like Marie, the slutty waitress that has no inhibition and lets people walk all over her. Some will look at her with disgust, others with pity but after reading this book... just MAYBE, the looks will change to understanding. Some people get shit on and others let it happen. This is life. This is the essence of this book. Truth, dirty and real and nothing you can do will stop it from happening. There are times I want to scream at the book and take a chunk out of it with my teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have any of you worked in the food industry? I did briefly, and from my experience this book is pretty dead on. Each little detail of what a day is like during the hustle and bustle of a mealtime is perfectly, horribly accurate. Hard work, end of story. I almost think that the way the job is might have something to do with the drugs, drinking and debauchery that happen, to get away from reality. Nobody wants to live like that forever, right? Theres parts of this book that make me feel grimey, like if I took my finger and rubbed it on the page, it would come back black with grime. I liked this book but do I think this is everyones cup of tea? No way. Do I think it's important to have a book that shows the perspective of a messed up girl working her butt off? Yes. People like this exist and I'll even admit that I've had my moments throughout the years that I can be ashamed of... but should we shy away from the reality of it? No. If you aren't afraid to get your hands dirty (well, maybe more your mind), read this book, I can promise you you'll learn something.\n",

      "I don’t like books like this anymore, books where your protagonist should know better but doesn’t and so she goes around and around making the same shitty decisions and banging 30 coworkers or restaurant patrons in a very short period of time. Merritt Tierce is that kind of writer, the strong and capable kind whose sentences have been whittled down to all of the important, gut-kicking words. Unfortunately, other times she’s so entwined with her story that paragraphs with the minutia of restaurant-life, the inside baseball stuff, gets stacked for pages and pages. The rest of the time, she’s telling essentially the same story over and over with different characters. That story is: My name is Marie. I hate myself, so I did this to dull it and I did this to feel it in a different way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Love Me Back” is told in a nonlinear collection of short stories. Marie gets pregnant as a teenager and ends up married to the good-guy father. But she cheats on him and cheats on him until he’s unable to ignore it and then, feeling cast into an ill-fitting role, she leaves him with the young girl. She makes a living in restaurants -- first Olive Garden then, later, an upscale steakhouse she refers to as The Restaurant. Along the way she bangs managers, co-workers, friends of co-workers, brothers, managers from different restaurants and more. In her free time, she snorts and cuts and has gooey mom thoughts about the daughter she sees during her limited amount of custody.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was in my 20s, I thought it was very romantic to hate yourself and treat people shitty -- like you were guided by some sort of but-this-is-just-how-I-am-ness, shrug, I can’t help it. Tierce’s Marie would fall into that category, as a woman seemingly unable to manage the job of self-care, but wholly capable of servicing strangers -- both at The Restaurant, where she is considered “golden” and in the parking lot behind the restaurant. I don’t think it’s romantic anymore. I think it’s exhausting -- especially in the case of this novel where she shows no real signs that she will ever be interested in yanking her boots free of the muck. Without a glimmer of change on the horizon, the stories begin to feel repetitious. Like, if Marie was your friend you would stand at your shared work station nodding along and wishing that if she planned on continuing to self-destruct, she would find some new ways to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can’t wait to read what she writes next, though, and my hope upon hopes is that there isn’t a man or a restaurant or an orifice or a sharp instrument anywhere near it.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is one of the best books I've read in years. Tierce has an incredible voice and I find her to be a truly inspiration debut fiction author. Her story \"Suck It\" (this inspiration for the novel) was wild and unforgiving and to see the book developed in it's entirety is phenomenal.\n",
      "\n",
      "We never get the true motivation of Marie, the main character, as she spirals into long hours, late nights, sex and drugs and I so appreciate Tierce's stylistic choice in this. The scenes are raw and what we see are the hardships young women face when coming into their own. It's painful and gritty and gutsy and it forces you to think about where your own life choices could (or could ) lead you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm recommending this book to everyone that I know.\n",

      "I am torn about this novel. In a sense, if you like shoot-em-up style stories with a little bit of a crime/detective story woven through it, then this is a story you would probably like. The best way to describe my feelings: If this were adapted into a film, the film would be better.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a lot of characters introduced throughout this story, which is about a detective (J. D.) and his partner (Hoolie) who go in search of a missing person. Along the way they uncover city corruption, dead bodies, and of course a lot of suspects--including a very interesting whore. One of the interesting pieces that separates this from other crime/detective fiction is the fact that Hoolie is Cherokee and throughout the novel you get some glimpses into that culture, including some discussion of oral tradition and ceremony. The murder is also connected to Indigenous land, so you meet a few Native characters throughout as well alongside your mayor, whore, sheriff, cowboys, KKK members, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also some information about the Tulsa Race Riots, Dawes Act, Osage Oil Murders, etc., that is woven if you like a bit of history to go with your stories. It is not always totally explained though so some of it might go over your head. That could be good or bad, depending on how you like your stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the things that detract from this novel include a secondary story that began in . At one point, J.D. has to go back to help characters from this story. For me, that should have been its own book. Keep me in one story at a time as a reader, I just prefer it that way. These areas did not \"go together\" in the end and I was disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, some of this story has cliches abundant. In terms of this being a historically dated piece with a cowboys versus Indians feel, these cliches might be good. The stock characters might be needed (you have a whore, sheriff, mayor, two cowboys, etc.) and are sometimes developed characters. The dialog at times can be overwhelming as well. It might be something that others would really like--this is definitely a shoot-em-up western. But this was something that I saw as problematic for my reading tastes.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Mysteries and thrillers can be plenty fun as they are with no intellectual exercises or social commentary worked in, but they can also serve as Trojan horses for leading readers to bigger ideas or cultural histories. Considering this story deals with an Irish detective and his Cherokee friend who attempt to solve a murder in the Kiowa territory of Oklahoma during Prohibition, I assumed it would try to do the latter. I was wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a shame because Tom Holm has a clear understanding of American and native history. He references Kiowa traditions like the Sun Dance ritual and Rainy Mountain. He also embeds other historical details into the story, such as the daftness of the KKK, the problems with union busting, Prohibition-era regulations, the dynamics of Indian reservations, plus old fashioned lingo. But he doesn't do much with these details. They are more window dressing than anything of depth. There was never a moment when I felt like I learned anything beyond the basic things I already knew about Kiowa culture or American history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, again, this might be all right if the story at hand were a thrilling one. But it isn't. Holm is not at all smooth in his writing. He crams antiquated words and phrases into otherwise modern sounding dialogue. He uses long winded info dumps both early on when giving the exposition and again when one of the characters wraps up the mystery (I know Poirot did this, too, but at least he had some style).\n",
      "\n",
      "The story overall is just too squeaky clean. The relationship between the Irish private detective and his Cherokee war veteran partner could have had some tension (a la Hell or High Water), and yet there is none. They are both perfectly polite to each other the entire way through. The story moves along a little too smoothly, the shady characters believe the cops a little too easily, the cops slip out of harm's way a little too conveniently, the good guys are a little too good, and the bad guys are a little too cartoonish.\n",

      "The Chicago Bears were created by George S. Halas. They weren't anything special in the first few years that were a franchise, but George Halas didn't think that. He was with, coach and player, the Bears for 60 years. He was so obsessed with his team that he got the nickname \"Papa Bear\". Missing one thing, the Bears went into each season with a desire to win and to take home that trophy. The one thing that they were missing was a championship victory. They're didn't have any luck winning the super bowl until the year 1985. They had all they could ask for. Mike Singletary, Richard Dent, Dan Hampton, William Perry, Jim McMahon, and Mike Ditka as a coach. There was no way that they would lose that super bowl, and they didn't.\n",

The Chicago Bears are my favorite NFL football team out of all 32 of them. Now that I have read this book I can say that I know every milestone in they're whole franchise from when they were created to today. This book's theme is to inform the reader about the history of the Chicago Bears.\n",

      "Famous but down to earth Rockstar Drew Morrison is finding harder and harder to keep his thoughts and hands-off Ashley Emmit – who has joined his tour to work on a college project, the daughter of his old professor she’s totally off limits – now if only he could remember that. Ashley for her part finds herself deeply drawn to Drew – as an artist his music touches her deeply and as a man, well, she finds herself questioning the rules she has been following for so long.\n",

      "Reading this so close after Love me like this (book 3 in the series) it’s clear leaving a big breaking in between reading Belle Andre’s books is best for me, otherwise things start feeling a tad too similar/repetitive. The tone of the book was super light and easy – there is no potent degree of emotion and tension, not necessarily a bad thing, but after reading book 3 before this I needed something with a bit of bite to it. This one won’t be going into my re-read pile.\n",

      "This is a fantastic companion to the television series Penny Dreadful. It is, essentially, a behind the scenes look of how the show came to be. The book covers the creative process of the show and details it from its beginning to the finished product. This provides valuable insight into the reasoning behind the writing, and highlights what the producers wanted to achieve with this amazing show that somehow, yes somehow, manages to bring in elements form Dracula, Frankenstein and Dorian Grey without ruining them in the slightest. I mean these extraordinary classics have been ruined on the screen countless times, so it really is remarkable that this show manages to bring them all together, with orginal characters, in a display of utter brilliance. And this book explains how they achieved such a monumental feat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The show is set in the Victorian era, thus the show had to adhere to the customs of the age. Every major decision made in regard to the set and its fulfilment to the ideas of Victorian London is meticulously explained and reasoned. The casting of the characters and how the actors even went to contribute to the characters further, in the case of Dorian Grey, is detailed in a revealing manner. The casting of this show is fantastic, so it really is quite exciting to see what the actors thought of the roles they played and how they were kept in the dark about their secrets.\n",

      "Penny dreadful is the best show on television at the moment, so if you love it then this book is a necessity really.\n",

      "I don't even feel bad watching it instead of reading because it's based in gothic literature, my favourite kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "This particular book is full of amazing full colour photographs and interviews with the actors on theirs and other characters. The author is a renowned making of book author and she has done a fantastic job with this one as well. This is beautifully laid out and just a damn fine book.\n",

      "Un regalo que recibí y que me hizo muy feliz porque tiene mucha información de la primera temporada de una de mis series favoritas. Fotos del rodaje, información sobre las locaciones, el vestuario y multitud de datos que me volaron la cabeza como que todos los libros  del salón de Malcolm Murray son REALES y propiedad del creador de la serie, John Logan.\n",

      "¡¡Cómo extraño a Penny Dreadful!! Éste libro es una joya para todo fan de la serie. El libro habla de la primera temporada exclusivamente, de los personajes, escenarios, historia y vida en el Londres de 1890. Gótica, victoriana, romántica, misteriosa, peligrosa, enigmática y fantástica Penny Dreadful. Como fan debo decir que la serie tenía potencial para mucho más. El final fue malo, apresurado e injusto para los personajes y sus fans. Ahora regresa en cómic y retomamos la serie desde la primera temporada, en donde surgen personajes que debieron salir en la serie televisiva y no tuvieron la oportunidad.\n",

      "The Suitable Boy is about a Hindu Indian girl and how her family tries to find her a young man to marry. The book is about much more than the marriage. It is about the family dynamics, Indian culture, history and politics. Its length is quite daunting. If you are looking for light reading, I would say look elsewhere! However, if you are looking to learn a lot about India then this is the book for you! I found Seth's writing witty and engaging at times. He really caught me by surprise at some points in the story. I found myself really attached to the characters as if I knew them by the end of the book. However, I found the political portions of the book too tedious. Seth made the politics and history of the country part of the family dynamics so I understand why he included them. However, all the detail made it hard for me to read. All the same, I enjoyed it and would recommend it for patient people.\n",

      "Family tree of Montgomery Taggert series : https://thejudedeverauxboard.proboard...\n",
      "Aria Princess of Lanconia , ( Rowan and Xena, The Maiden)comes to America to offer Vanadium to the American Government. She is kidnapped and dumped overboard and shot at in the Florida Keys. JT Montgomery is camping on the deserted Island for three days leave from the Navy. He is Lieutenant Montgomery son of Hank and Amanda Montgomery (The Awakening) of Warbrooke Shipping Maine. He rescues Aria but she is used to her Royal status and Protocol from her country. JT thinks she is a snob and an ungrateful useless woman. He basically gives her the tough love treatment but common human decency wins out and he helps her so she won’t die of starvation and exposure. After two days his army buddy Bill comes to pick them up. They take her to Washington giving her money with a few instructions and the men return to duty. Aria has never dressed herself before, never used money before, never cooked or done any domestic work. She is used to being waited on and obeyed. She was raised to never show emotion or show pain. She appeared to be as cold as ice. She finally met with General Brooks after telling people she was a German Spy. She told him she was the real Princess of Lanconia as her cousin Cissy was posing as her. After being questioned for a couple of days the American Government made a deal with her. She was to marry an American with a great pedigree and good moral character with no skeletons in his closet to ensure the deal between their two countries was guaranteed. She wanted money for her country to help her people and they wanted Vanadium. They chose JT Montgomery as the groom. He only did it because he was helping his country and the same for Aria. She was supposed to learn to be an American and learn how to be an American wife. JTs friends helped her especially Dolly and Bill. The highlight was when she and JTs mother Amanda performed a song and dance from a popular movie of a Brazilian singer at the Officers Annual Ball. JT and Aria go back to Lanconia and Arias Grandfather the King asks JT to be her Bodyguard and help protect her so they can find out who is trying to assassinate her. She is engaged to Count Julian and he is only interested in her Kingdom wanting to rule. He doesn’t really see her as a woman. JT keeps a close eye on her and everything and everyone trying to find the killer. Eventually cousin Freddy tries to shoot her in the secret tunnels in the Palace. JT rescues her for the third time. JT ends up leaving to go back home but chooses love over career and country and returns to Lanconia and Aria to rule with her. They truly loved one another. This story was more of a Rom Com than a Historical Romance with a Mystery. I loved the story and gave it five stars. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n",

      "Another much beloved book of all time. It's set in the 1940s, a time period that I really love. JT Montgomery is such a good hero, can I have one of him? He's a military man on a mission, and he will complete it. He is a hero in the true sense, although he's not anywhere near royalty. Although he comes from the grand Montgomery dynasty, he's All-American in his thinking. He didn't expect to fall for Aura, who is all-princess. This is such a delightful book, from beginning to end. I was hoping in vain that JD would write some more 1940s romances. Sigh. Alas it's just not a ripe period for historical romances. This book had some steam when I read it back then. It would be tame nowadays though. Loved the lovemaking on the stairs scene. Wow! I also loved the scene when we see Amanda dancing with her daughter-in-law Aura like Carmen Miranda. This book is just all around wonderful in every way.\n",

      "I really enjoyed this, but I’m not sure how much I actually learnt. Murch is certainly amusing to read and I can imagine great to listen to. I’ve been editing since I was 12 so it has certainly affirmed and validated for me a lot of the things I knew about editing on certain levels, but never have had explicitly stated. This new edition is already 20 years old. I am DYING to know what Murch has to say on the evolution of editing within social video like goddammit how does he feel about tiktoks I GOTTA KNOW\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "While this is more geared towards the editing concerns for larger productions with multi-month editing cycle, Murch has many insights into the basic practicalities of editing. Even better are the bits where he delves further, into the theoretical underpinnings of what a cut is, and why they work at all given the unfamiliarity of jump cuts in day to day life (so one would think). Still, it's converted pretty directly from a lecture he delivered, which keeps the material a little close to the surface for my liking -- I should really keep reading this Peter Wollen film theory book I found at the Strand for the denser, deeper conceptual stuff, or more Ruiz perhaps. And, over half the length of the book is an Afterword, added in 2001, concerning the new advances in digital editing, of course now 13 years out of date, ie essentially a lifetime. Still, Murch is a great editor, and this forms a brisk overview of the subject.\n",

      "بخلاف كون والتر ميرش واحد من أعظم مونتيرين السينما في التاريخ، فهو أيضاً كاتب ممتاز لديه القدرة على صياغة أفكاره على الورق. النصف الأول من الطبعة التي قرأتها يُركز على فن المونتاج، النصف الثاني هو مُلحق عن المونتاج الرقمي الذي كان جديداً نسبياً وقت كتابته في العام 2001 (وقت صدور الطبعة الثانية)، معظم هذا الجزء أصبح الآن معلومات تاريخية، قرأته سريعاً للمتعة فحسب ولكن بلا إفادة. أما النصف الأول الخاص بفن المونتاج فهو رائع ومُهم لكل سينمائي.\n",

      "This is a nice little book on film editing. Walter Murch has edited many films, Apocalypse Now, The Godfather Part II, and The Conversation. He writes about his editing process and somewhat the history of cutting films. One of the things I found most interesting is that Murch says its not obvious that film cuts should work as well as they do. Most of what we experience visually from the moment we get up is a continous stream of linked images. The \"cut\" would seem to go against and one would think would be more jarring. But not only are cuts a pragmatic tool for the filmmaker, they can actually enhance the experience - be a preferred tool of choice. The only thing we experience like it are dreams, and Murch surmises this is where the link is established. We can say to a young scared child, it was only a dream. Likewise, we do this with scary movies as well: it's only a movie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another interesting aspect of the book was his emphasis on paying attention to when actors blink. A good actor's blinks will in some way be tied to his/her thoughts and emotions. Murch noticed at some point in his career with Gene Hackman, that where Hackman blinked was often a good place to cut a sequence (just before the blink). A bad actor can often be spotted by the strange rhythmn of their blinking - it doesn't seem to be matching the emotional landscape of the story. They may be nervous or pre-occupied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Murch has a chapter on all the new software out on editing film and he is still a bit skeptical it can deliver on all its claims. With the older technology, it required you to sift through alot of material, and sometimes you would come across footage that was just what you needed - footage you may have discarded before. He thinks the new technology will probably,in time, bridge the advantages of new and old. But as of his writing, he still felt the older editing machines were better.\n",

      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Divided into two parts, this book is essentially the sharing of a film editor from his career and the history of editing technology from his personal experience. While one can never doubt his credentials to teach (he edited Copolla's Apocalypse Now, in which production probably produced the most footages in film history for an editor to work on...), I am not sure what a reader can learn from this short book apart from a few truisms. The fact that only two editing examples are given photos also doesn't help.\n",

      "Absolutely stunning collection of short stories which teach and entertain in equal measure. Ken Liu has an incredible imagination and these stories are all so different and yet all so amazing. I, like many others, come to Ken Liu after his superb translations of Cixin Liu's The Three-Body Problem and Death's End and I can see that he was the perfect choice because his love of language and culture echoes that of Cixin Liu in many, many ways. I also saw some commonality in some of their sci fi ideas. But, it is the realistic depiction of his characters and the innate poetry of the prose that helped me plunge into each story. I loved each one and found that each asked fundamental questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bookmaking Habits of Select Species - this one reminded me a lot of Italo Calvino. Questions asked: What is literature? How is it transmitted and interpreted?\n",
      "State Change - fantastic compact story with lovely vignettes about TS Elliott, Joan of Arc, etc. Questions asked: What is the soul? What is our capacity for change?\n",
      "Perfect Match - loved the reference to Vivaldi's Violin Concerto in C Minor, haunting dystopia where Google and Amazon Alexa rule the world. Questions asked: What is free choice? How much are we willing to compromise on privacy before our lives become completely passive?\n",
      "Good Hunting - love story with magic, steampunk, transformation. Questions asked: How big a cultural price are we willing to pay for technological progress?\n",
      "The Literomancer - gorgeous, painful, amazing. Love the idea of word magic, poetic. Questions asked: How does language, our choice of works, express identity?\n",
      "Simulacrum - spooky. Questions asked: Where do we draw the line in reality between the real and the simulated? Once love is objectified, is it still love?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Regular - great murder mystery - idea of emotion suppressor is great, but open wifi is terrifying. Are emotions an impediment or a tool in a critical situation? Can we be redeemed?\n",
      "The Paper Menagerie - beautiful and magical story. What is memory? How do we see keep a sense of wonder as we grow older? Does magic exist?\n",
      "An Advanced Reader’s Picture Book of Comparative Cognition (previously unpublished) - similar to first story but on communication, chocolate analogy. What is thought? How do we learn? Can electric sheep dream?\n",
      "The Waves - solar sails, greek mythology, russian doll stort stacking, seafoam was a beautiful image. Would immortality be a paradise or a hell? Is death a release or an end? Where is the boundary between machine and consciousness?\n",
      "Mono no aware - lovely - go and poetry and web of others eyes, kitten's tongue. How do we love? How do we express love?\n",
      "All the Flavors - western, Idaho City fire 1865 - awesome story about Chinese Immigrants for the railroad that end up mining and classic Chinese myths. How do we set aside preconceived ideas and open up to other cultures? Must the meeting of two disparate cultures always end in tears and bloodshed, or can it be harmonious?\n",
      "A Brief History of the Trans-Pacific Tunnel - sci fi dystopia racism formosan. Can one redeem oneself from the unforgivable? What are the limits to human adaptability?\n",
      "The Litigation Master and the Monkey King - great story from Qinglong dynasty. How do we liberate history from willful forgetfulness? What is a hero?\n",
      "The Man Who Ended History: A Documentary -devastating but amazing.\n",
      "See this to see that the Chinese are making swift progress with quantum entanglement in our era already. As for the atrocities discussed (Nanjing Massacre and especially Unit 731 in Pingfang, China) and the debate around their historicity and the guilt of the perpetrators, this is all very, very real. Note that the US is not innocent here either:\n",
      "\"MacArthur struck a deal with Japanese informants—he secretly granted immunity to the physicians of Unit 731, including their leader, in exchange for providing America, but not the other wartime allies, with their research on biological warfare and data from human experimentation.\"\n",
      "From Wikipedia article quoting Unit 731 Testimony by Hal Gold (2011)\n",
      "Questions asked: What are the relative values to subjective and objective perception? What boundaries define history and ownership of history? How do we deal with acts of extreme depravity without becoming deranged or depraved ourselves? Does every act of preservation necessary involve and act of destruction? How do we assign guilt when the victims are dead, their names and remains vaporized and the perpetrators neatly all dead? How do we validate history? What is truth? What is justice? Yeah, this one opens up a LOT of questions for the reader!\n",

      "3/ he is extremely well-read\n",

Full disclosure that English is my third language. I’m a Chinese born and raised in Indonesia, and I grew up learning about all three Chinese, Indonesian, and Western cultures and languages due to my upbringing, environment, and education. This is the most pivotal reason why most of the short stories here resonated with me. I understand how difficult it can be to learn and adapt to different cultures and languages, especially on an everyday basis; I’m still learning up to this day, and I will always continue to do so. The majority of my friends and followers on Goodreads, as far as I know, are not Asian, but even if you’re not, this collection is still a must-read if you’re looking for amazing fictions that will also help you understand more about Asian history, way of life, superstition, and struggles.\n",

However, this collection is exceptional. Almost all of the stories exhibited in this collection were wonderfully well-written. They’re memorable, philosophical, introspective, fascinating, and some of them were extraordinarily emotional. I’m thoroughly amazed by the versatility of Liu’s storytelling. Whether it’s fantasy, sci-fi, magical realism, noir thriller, or historical fiction, has them all. If you’re a fan of speculative fiction, I honestly don’t see how most of these stories won’t work for you. I’m not kidding, out of fifteen stories included in this collection, only two of them didn’t click with me. As for the rest? I either liked them or absolutely loved them.

The topics of empathy, mother’s love for their child, and the acceptance of our own race embedded in this short story undeniably tugged at my heartstrings. is a brilliantly imaginative, poignant, and magnificently written short story that almost made me cry within 15 pages.

It’s dark, violent, terrifying, depressing, and it made many grimdark novels tame in comparison. The craziest part about this, though, is the fact that the Unit 731 incident is real; this isn’t fictional, Unit 731 is a part of humanity’s history. The world knows about the Nazi and Auschwitz concentration camp, but it’s shocking to me that many people—Asian or not—have never heard about this atrocious incident.

My parents enjoy the odd book, but aren’t what I would describe as avid readers.

      "All they knew about the book prior to the reading was that it was going to be fantastical. They had no idea that Liu’s eponymous story won the Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy Award all in the same year nor, I hazard, would they have cared. Then, following the reading, I asked them two questions:\n",

      ": At times I did like it!\n",
      "“WTF?”Can I start with that? Am I allowed to say WTF? I enjoyed that people read through science, smells, traveling through stars. I think it is about all the different ways that stories can be told and the way they change like when the Romans told stories compared to someone who does science writing.\n",
      "\n",
      ": Yeah, I dug this.\n",
      "As I was reading this, I kept thinking that my parents had to be suffering through it, but I trudged on. Liu’s fantastical creatures have me excited for the rest of the stories and it seems like a pretty smooth move to start off a short story collection with a story about books and stories. I enjoyed my parents’ reactions and I really liked my dad’s interpretation. I’m excited to see what tomorrow’s story brings.\n",

      "She lived her life as a piece of ice, and it is cool that she was so closed off that people didn’t even know the colour of her eyes. I liked that even though she was a closed off person, she enjoyed reading about other peoples lives. Also, a threesome.\n",
      "\n",
      ": Oh yeah, big win!\n",
      "I thought this story was peculiar, but smart, well realized, and the perfect example of sci-fi done right. The story had a lot of heart to it and provided a beautiful metaphor for social isolation and how different personalities interact.

It really threw me for a loop to move from the really unique fantasy/sci-fi into this highly serious historical account of the atrocities committed by American spies against the Chinese populace.

      "Hey, I thought it was good!\n",
      "My parents were, obviously, not that into this one; however, I thought it was poignant. It was so inarguably sad, but the message was a good one: forgive your loved ones. I mean, 10 pages of these poor people stuck in a limbo of dysfunction with an underlying sci-fi concept was, again, a great display of Liu’s skills.\n",

      "A great story. The detective’s trauma motivated her to use the regulator to watch her emotions, but her emotions also draw her in to help the victim’s mother. I think story about forgiveness and making amends. I like that all the characters came together through their loss.\n",
      "\n",

      "I wasn’t expecting a murder mystery in this collection, but boy, that was great stuff! I often find thrillers to be not thrilling enough, or so fixed on thrills that they just end up being a slight twist on a story you’ve read before. This was smart, the use of sci-fi was original, and there was a strong emotional core to this story. This keeps on being a winner.\n",

      "Man, this one almost had me tearing up during the reading! Such a touching story that brings home the fraught relationships we can have with our parents and the difficulties we can have in understanding one another.

      "Okay, a bit of an explanation. These are fairy tales about extraterrestrial races who are each supposed to embody one of the cardinal sciences. These stories are also interspersed with the story of a mother who left her family for the stars.

What surprises me most about this collection is that I expected a straight SF/F set of stories, but I ended up getting a lot of historical fiction. is a tale about Chinese immigrants in the US with a Western setting. Liu’s got a talent for exposing relatively unknown historical facts with heartfelt stories. This one is no different!\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      ": I liked it.\n",

      "\n",
      ": I liked it.\n",
      "I found it very good how they used songs to transport the story like travelling storytellers. I really liked it actually, I enjoy stories about sacrifices by good people.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked it.\n",
      "You know, I should have expected some form of law-based story from Liu, who is also a practicing litigator. I wasn’t absolutely nuts for this one, but I have enjoyed the stories that aren’t SF/F and are instead about Chinese history.\n",
      "\n",
      "**As a follow-up to mom’s comments about the different names, they were all very similar sounding (pronounced by my unsophisticated tongue), but would be easily differentiated if reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ": I LOVED this story.\n",
      "This last one is also fairly long, so I didn’t read it to my parents, though I will probably get them to read it at their leisure in the future. Simply put: this is a harrowing and ingenious story. Liu has managed to marry the atrocities of Pingfang and Unit 731 with a sci-fi concept. In a show of immense skill, Liu examines the societal, legal, and historical consequences of the sci-fi discovery. What a way to end the collection, Liu is a master. This is why I read sci-fi.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What a wonderful, beautiful, powerful, and well-written collection of short stories. You’re not likely to find anything out there quite like Liu’s work. It is unique, well thought-out, and not just SF/F as billed. Instead, there’s a mix of history, literary fiction, sci-fi, fantasy, and intersections of all the aforementioned genres. It is a superb work that I’d recommend to any and all readers!\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the unique reading/reviewing format: also a success! I had a lot of fun discussing these stories with my parents, and it was a great way to connect over some complex ideas. It was a pleasure to bring a solitary activity into a social atmosphere, plus a lovely way to hang out with the parental units. Thanks Mom and Dad for being co-authors on this review!\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A beautifully written, powerful anthology of first-rate speculative fiction stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ken Liu is an impressive guy, besides writing he is also a lawyer and a programmer. Many readers first read his translation of Liu Cixin’s Hugo award winning novel The Three-Body Problem. I read his 2014 Tor.com short work Reborn and so had a good idea he can produce a gem on his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building on ubiquitous themes of Asian-American cultural pluralities and Chinese myth and legend, Liu does an impressive job creating a continuing and pervasive sense of inventiveness. These fifteen stories, some sketches and others novella sized range from cool sci-fi to wildly imaginative fantasy and everything in between.\n",
      "\n",
      "“State Change” features a girl whose soul was an ice cube. One of my favorites was “The Perfect Match\" which describes a futuristic Siri type all inclusive app called Sintillian that takes surveillance to a whole new level and Liu throws in some interesting twists.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good Hunting” is a smooth blend of Asian myth and steampunk.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Literomancer” is a heartbreaking story that shows an old man tortured and a red headed Texan girl in a morality play on Cold War policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another of my favorites was “The Regular\", a novella length cyborg murder mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Paper Menagerie” was the story that got all the press and some awards, but it was not my favorite by far. A bittersweet fantasy about generational and cultural chasms.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An Advanced Reader’s Picture Book of Comparative Cognition” (previously unpublished) is a very Poul Anderson kind of story, reminiscent especially of Anderson’s 1970 . “The Waves” is another Poul Anderson inspired work, this one like . “Mono no aware” is a Bradburyesque tale of space.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All the Flavors” is a western from the perspective of a little girl. My favorite TV show of all time is Kung Fu, and the Chinese characters in this western setting reminded me pleasingly of the show.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A Brief History of the Trans-Pacific Tunnel” was a very Heinleinesque, optimistic alternate history story about – what else?\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Litigation Master and the Monkey King\" – fantastic and fun, litigators should always be in the protagonist role. Liu the juris doctor shows his stripes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liu saved his best and most powerful for the last. “The Man Who Ended History: A Documentary” Stories of Nazi atrocities are well known in the west but Liu reminds us about horrific injustices committed by the Japanese. Using some ingenious time travel ideas, Liu revisits the Japanese occupation of Manchuria and paints a brutal portrait of inhumanity. I read a few years ago and it took months to gear myself up for the task and then months afterwards to recover. There is only so much horror the mind can take. I will someday read that documents this same occupation, but reading Liu’s story has set this reading back further.\n",
      "\n",
      "For readers of modern speculative fiction, this is a must read.\n",

      "This was just a terrible book. There is too much action without much else. There is no subtlety to the plot. Characters are thrown about as if they were nothing, characters were introduced haphazardly, as needed. This was just a very poorly thought out book.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I don't know about anyone else but when I think of Robin Hood I think of this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm the only one who pictured him like that? Huh. Blame my childhood.\n",
      "Anyway, when I first started reading this book I admittedly imagined Robin Hood as being pretty hot. Like a total fox. (GET IT?!)\n",
      "Granted, the Robin Hood in this story was not the main character. Rather, the main character was a young woman who everyone knew as Scarlet. Her identity is mysterious and only a few people know that she's secretly a girl. She's tough, smart, brave, and completely capable of taking care of herself. She's a hardcore, kick-butt girl living in the Middle Ages. Or at least that's how I think the author wanted her to come off as. In reality she's kind of a whiny jerk to everyone. When people try to be genuinely nice to her she's completely rude and pushes them away. I couldn't stand her character. She was ill-mannered and unappreciative. I guess she was supposed to seem really independent but instead she just seemed stuck up and full of it. Maybe she wasn't as bad as I'm making her out to be, but there were plenty of times where I actually wanted to go into the book and strangle her.\n",
      "I also got really annoyed at the way Scarlet talked. She didn't use proper grammar at all, despite the rest of the Merry Men have perfect grammar. And that would have bothered me except\n",
      ". It's eventually revealed that she grew up as a privileged lady. So why is her grammar terrible?! You would think her grammar would be loads better than everyone else's, as she lived in an upper class society. But noooooo. Maybe I shouldn't be fussing over that little detail this much but it seriously got on my nerves since she had been raised with nobles.\n",
      "Scarlet was also too selfless. She kept trying to sacrifice herself to save others. Which hey, heroes are good! But it was too the point where she just seemed like an idiot. Like her sacrifices were suicidal and it was like she was trying too hard to play the martyr. She had no common sense. Like she refused to eat because there were people in the town starving. Okay, because you can totally help them when your dying of hunger. That makes about as much sense as, well -\n",
      "\n",
      "You know what else I hated about this book? It was completely and utterly unnecessary. It was the thing that bothered me the most in this entire book. So in the love triangle, we've got Scarlet, Little John, and Robin Hood. Robin Hood clearly has feelings for Scarlet but she's in denial. Little John suddenly decides he's attracted to her and she starts responding to him, despite the fact that he admits that he's not serious about it. Robin meanwhile turns all jealous but rather then admitting to Scarlet that it's because he's in love with her, he gives her the cold shoulder and threatens to kick her out of the group. Real smart, fox-boy.\n",
      "She swears that she has no interest in Little John. So why do you keep cuddling and kissing him, Scarlet? Huh? She keeps leading on Little John and Robin Hood and then acts shocked when they get mad at her. At this point, I was getting more than a little peeved a at Scarlet..\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I don't know why she was even conflicting about all this! If she claimed that she had no interest in Little John, then why did she keep showing him affection? Not to mention that he's a total jerk to everyone. Robin Hood was at least a gentlemen at the beginning (before he turned all angsty). Little John is just mean. What I want to wonder if why the author chose Little John to be apart of the love triangle. Maybe it's just me, but when I picture Little John I think of this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus we all knew she was going to end up with Robin. Little John was just an unnecessary distraction. It was really predictable. The Little John subplot was a ruse! This is what I was about ready to do to that 'love triangle':\n",
      "\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "Okay, so I suppose I should go into what I liked about the book. Because, contrary to my previous rambling, I didn't hate the book. It was more of a 2.5 rating but technically it got three stars. The plot was well-paced and fairly exciting. It wasn't slow or tedious. The writing style flowed enough that I was able to read it easily so kudos to that. And the entire cast of characters weren't all that bad. They weren't perfect but I occasionally felt compassion for them.\n",
      "There's one other thing about this book that I feel like I should mention.\n",
      "Guy of Gisbourne.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, I know I was supposed to hate him. He was supposed to be a cruel, evil, horrible being that murdered innocent beings. Is it so bad that I wanted him to turn from the dark ways because he was actually in love with Scarlet? I'm a total sucker for bad-guys-who-fall-for-good-girls. Especially when it causes them to question their moral beliefs. I actually loved the part where Scarlet calls him a monster and he yells that she made him a monster, and that he's been desperately searching for her for many years. I honestly wanted them to fall in love, after he changed his psycho murderer ways of course. Don't judge me! I watched BBC's Robin Hood series. When I pictured Guy of Gisbourne I imagined this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently I'm insane because that never went down. Guy vanishes once Scarlet and the Merry Men defeat him and all is well. The climax was a bit confusing to me. One moment she's marrying Guy and the next she's running all over the place and being a ninja. At times I wasn't really sure what the blazes was going on. Oh well. In the end, Guy just runs off and the Merry Men have won. Huzzah! And then Scarlet and Robin Hood finally wind up together and it ends a little something like this:\n",

Yes Will Scarlet, the most skilled knife- handling young fellow of Robin, in the traditional tales, famous for his hot temper. But he’s not actually what we think he is. He’s no lad; he’s a lass; a girl hiding her true identity in men’s cloth.\n",

She’s one of the bravest and toughest female protagonists I have ever came across, no wonder why Robin called her a worrier woman. Scarlet was Invulnerable to fear or intimidation. She faced and withstands Gisbourne with courage. She helped the people of Nottingham the best she could, she fought for justice alongside Robin, John and Much. She may have a tough exterior, but her interior was made with delicate glass just like an eighteen years old girl, which shattered with each piercing word came from Robin and melted in warm embrace of the same person. As a reader, above all as a girl I was empathetic to her pain and adopted them as mine. Sometime it was really hard for me to hold back my tears. Her feeling and affection was strong for Rob, but the ultimate sacrifice she made to save the person she loved was praise worthy.\n",

      "Hurting Scar was the best way to punish himself, and of course Rob was not very proud of that. In spite of every effort he made to deny his own feelings for Scar, I could see the warm compassionate feelings in his stormy eyes.

I liked how the author painted his character with colors of fun and sincerity in equal measure. is definitely not a love triangle but John’s growing fondness and likeness for her spiced up the story a little bit. He’s appearance throughout the whole story was remarkable. When it came to loyalty and devotion to Robin and his band, no one was fierce as him.\n",
      "was always like a brother to Scarlet, the only person Scarlet was most comfortable with. Sometime I felt sympathy for him, but he proved he doesn’t need anyone’s sympathy. In spite of having one good arm, Much has a quality of spirit and will power that enabled him to fight.\n",

Sometime untold truth buried beneath the history, we just need to dig that deep. The writing was very touching and mesmerizing that I applaud her efforts. The ending was completely unexpected and my heart skipped a bit. Series of turns and twists, secrets and actions, will leave you speechless. This book is Capable of arousing and holding the attention.\n",

      "Lovecraft's Monsters is a short story anthology of tales featuring monsters created by H.P. Lovecraft.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, H.P. Lovecraft, along with Edgar Rice Burroughs and Arthur Conan Doyle, is a writer that I'm much more interested in the works they inspired rather than their own writings. I know it's akin to liking a remake better than the original but HPL's prose has always been hard to digest for me and his character read like they were written by someone who never leaves his house. However, his Cthulhu Mythos is pretty special so I snatched this up when it appeared on Netgalley.\n",
      "\n",
      "The introduction gives a brief overview and then goes to say the stories were either commissioned or picked because they haven't appeared in many anthologies. And then the first story was a Neil Gaiman one I've seen in at least two other books. Not a good sign, although it was the one where a werewolf is going up against the Cthulhu mythos so it wasn't terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like all books of this type, the stories vary in quality and enjoyment level. The stories by Laird Barron and Joe Lansdale were both really good. Noir and Lovecraft go really well together for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Same Deep Waters as You by Brian Hodge was by far my favorite tale in the collection. The psychic star of The Animal Whisperer gets taken to an island off the coast of Washington to converse with citizens of a little place called Innsmouth, who have been imprisoned there since 1928...\n",

      "***** Only the End of the World Again by Neil Gaiman\n",
      "A bad-ass werewolf visits Innsmouth, and gets mixed up in more than he bargained for. Reminded me a bit of 'The Wicker Man,' with extra paranormal elements. Humorous without being 'light,' Gaiman's sincere love for Lovecraft shines through here.\n",
      "\n",
      "**** Bulldozer by Laird Barron\n",
      "A bad-ass Pinkerton agent travels West, in search of a circus strongman who's on the lam, suspected of multiple murders - and, more importantly, of stealing an ancient book on demonology from none other than P.T. Barnum. The premise isn't something that sounds like it'd be up my alley, but Barron really pulls it off. His Old West has a very 'Deadwood' feel to it that I enjoyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "*** Red Goat Black Goat by Nadia Bulkin\n",
      "Some kids get a nice magical nanny like Mary Poppins. And some kids get a magical nanny who's actually half nanny-goat and all terrifying. The Javanese setting here is a nice touch; though I don't know if the story is based on actual Indonesian myth as well as the Cthulhu mythos.\n",
      "\n",
      "**** The Same Deep Waters as You by Brian Hodge\n",
      "The popular TV host of 'The Animal Whisperer' is recruited by the US military and bundled off to a Guantanamo-style island, where 'enemy combatants'deemed a threat to National Security have been held secretly - for the past century. These 'mutants' were captured in a raid on Innsmouth. The TV personality's assignment? To learn to communicate with these fish-men. I had some doubts about the modern setting, but it's done well. This story does a remarkably good job of capturing Lovecraft's exact feeling toward his fish-men - a hard-to-pin-down mix of repulsion, horror, respect and sympathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "** A Quarter to Three by Kim Newman\n",
      "This one fell flat, for me. The story aims at humor, depicting a distraught pregnant teen who comes into a desolate all-night diner to meet her lover. The diner is in Innsmouth, so you can guess the reveal...\n",
      "\n",
      "** The Dappled Thing by William Browning Spencer\n",
      "A too-self-conscious steampunk story of British colonialism. An adventurer is sent to retrieve a wealthy aristocrat's wayward granddaughter from the savage jungles. The Brits' tentacled mechanical traveling machine tangles with a mysterious aquatic monster, and a narrow escape is made - or is it?\n",
      "\n",
      "*** Inelastic Collisions by Elizabeth Bear\n",
      "A couple of fallen angels (who seem a lot more like monsters) bewail their incarnate state, and seek their prey in urban pool halls... until they encounter a pool shark who may be more than he seems.\n",
      "\n",
      "** Remnants by Fred Chappell\n",
      "Lovecraft is 'cleaned up' for the 'middle-grades' in this post-apocalyptic sci-fi novella. Too long, too trite, the portrayal of the psychic autistic child was just annoying. It didn't have the 'feel' of Lovecraft's mythos at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "*** Love is Forbidden, We Croak & Howl by Caitlín R. Kiernan\n",
      "Unusual - both for this anthology and for Kiernan. It's humorous! Forbidden attraction between an Innsmouth fish-woman and an inhuman ghoul...\n",
      "\n",
      "**** The Sect of the Idiot by Thomas Ligotti\n",
      "The first few times I read short stories from Ligotti, I was actually under the impression that he was a contemporary of Lovecraft. He has that old-fashioned, circumnambulating and understated approach to horror (paired with a good vocabulary.) I enjoy it. Of all the stories in this volume, this one definitely comes the closest to resembling an actual Lovecraft story. A solitary man in a strange town... a bizarre dream, a seemingly random encounter, and of course, chthonic, alien forces.\n",

      "\n",
      "*** Waiting at the Crossroads Motel by Steve Rasnic Tem\n",
      "An abusive, nearly subhuman man, who's never known his father, is drawn by strange urges to bring his family to a remote and dilapidated motel. And then, other guests start filtering in... guests that all bear an odd, familial resemblance to one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "*** I’ve Come to Talk with you Again by Karl Edward Wagner\n",
      "A group of writers meet for their regular reunion, a pub night. One of them, the most successful, seems vigorous and preternaturally young. The others: old before their time, creaky and querulous. Some have died since their last meeting. Is there something more sinister than coincidence here?\n",
      "\n",
      "**** The Bleeding Shadow by Joe R. Lansdale\n",
      "Excellent noir horror with a 1930s (?) jazz setting. A private investigator is begged by a beautiful woman to see what's happened to her brother - a talented jazz musician but a freeloader - who's unexpectedly gone missing. The only thing she knows is that he's mailed her a deeply eerie recording. She recognizes her brother's voice, but the music is like nothing on earth. The narrator tracks him down - but there's a good reason that he'd left town.\n",

      "This anthology is an excellent homage to the monsters of Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Solid stories by some of the best authors in the business, past and present, each with a striking illustration make this a must for any fan of the Mythos.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Collections of short fiction based on the Cthulhu Mythos never get old but they can be predictable. Editor Ellen Datlow attempts to spice up the idea by featuring stories based on the monsters of H. P. Lovecraft's weird and twisted mind. Even the ardent Lovecraft fan may go mad trying to place some of the creatures, so Datlow added a neat Monster Index to keep you up on the creepies you will meet. The fiction itself tends to be uneven but there are enough gems to keep you reading. Neil Gaiman's \"Only the End of the World Again\" starts the collection and has the achievement of shining above most of the stories. It's hard to not like a story that brings Larry Talbot and Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos together. If you don't know who Larry Talbot is, you are not much of a horror fan. Another good mash-up, \"Black as the Pit, from Pole to Pole by Howard Waldrop and Steven Utley, brings Mary Shelly and Lovecraft together with the hollow world theory. I haven't seen one of Howard Waldrop's speculative mini-masterpieces for ages. It isn't \"The Ugly Chickens\" but it is still really entertaining. The third \"don't miss\" story is by the always dependable Joe R. Lansdale who gives \"The Bleeding Shadows\" a bluesy East Texas drawl. Steve Rasnic Tem's \"Waiting at the Crossroads Motel\" qualifies as one of the creepiest of the bunch. The rest range from very good to passable but none are out of place in this Lovecraft Tribute. A strong three and a half stars.\n",

      "The first one hundred pages were good, I thought I was getting back into the fascinated science fiction universe that I'd spent thousands of pages exploring with this author before. My curiosity was ramping up as I saw pieces of the past being pulled into what appeared to be an exciting new mystery and the puzzle pieces seemed to be assembling. And then...the rest of the book is a boring and totally stereotypical revolution full of comrades and cells and people I don't care about in a city I don't care about on a world I don't care about. All of my early excitement drained away into a plodding determination to keep reading because surely something interesting was coming, surely the the pieces of this huge sweeping millennias long science fiction saga were all going to fall into place and fit together, but this huge book is almost entirely a dull fantasy story with nothing original in it. The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress did revolution decades ago, that was interesting and stirring and short! What does this add to revolutions? And even the stuff about Nigel is so slight that it's practically incidental, there wasn't enough to make me care about him. There wasn't enough about any of the characters to me me care about them. The only emotion in any of it was in what happened to Laura, and that was barely a few pages here as there. It's an extremely disappointing book.\n",

      "The hard-SF universe on the outside, represented by Nigel, infiltrates the Void and what we have is a massive story of subverting the governments, dealing with another alien species set on escaping and/or destroying the Void (like Nigel).\n",

      "What we wind up getting is a humble beginning with an altruistic wedding, delightful interactions here, ramped up to a full revolution to destabilize the entire freaking population in the Void. :)\n",

      "Unique one character focus and the importance of coherence\n",
      "The reappearing characters are one of the reasons to read Hamilton´s series in chronological order, one that makes coming home to his series even more satisfying. Who knows Nigel, will love how this character evolves, acts, talks, and plans, as it´s one of the rare cases of more main focus on one protagonist, instead of many of them, as in other of Hamilton´s series.\n",

      "It strongly reminded me of the Banks concept of Special circumstances, the secret special über agency handling interventions when the prime first contact non interference policy doesn´t work anymore. Although it´s more of an ingenious one man army so close to Iron Man gone sci-fi that it´s a joy to compare. Does anyone care that these are, in reality, always the bad tycoon guys who cause all messes? Meh, whatever, their fictional counterparts just rock and save the universe.\n",

      "Expanding the mental concept\n",
      "The, also in the Void series appearing, concept of making mental abilities as strong or even stronger than technology is seen very often, Matrix, loads of sci-fi in genre hybrids, but just a few ones like Hamilton can add the extra bombast megalomaniac aspect to this concept, having written 5 novels in 2 series meandering between overlapping spheres of realities and universes.\n",

It also makes me wonder why he is the only author I know of who did this. One, who is new, lucky you, by the way, ought consider reading it in chronological order.\n",

      "\n",
      "For those of you who have never heard of Peter F. Hamilton, he is a giant within the science fiction genre, and specialist in space operas in particular. In The Abyss Beyond Dreams Hamilton returns to the Commonwealth and the universe of his acclaimed Void Trilogy with the first installment of Chronicle of the Fallers, a new two-part series. Abyss is perfect both for fans of Hamilton’s work and for new readers; the events of this novel expand on the story and setting of the Void Trilogy, but Hamilton gives enough background to make the story easy to follow for readers that are new to the Commonwealth. This impressive novel lives up to Hamilton’s reputation and gives the reader all they could ever want in a science fiction story and more: an alien landscape with magic-like properties, a fascinating and engaging plot, wonderful characterization, plenty of adventure, a dash of politics, and a story on an epic scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story takes place in the year 3326, where interplanetary travel is possible and the Commonwealth reigns. In the center of the galaxy is the Void, a place once thought to be a black hole, where the laws of physics do not always apply and magic-like mental powers are commonplace. The story follows Nigel Sheldon, one of the famous founders of the Commonwealth. When he is visited by the the Raiel, the self-appointed guardians of the Void, they convince him to journey into the Void to search for the existence of a colony of vessels that were pulled into the alien landscape and lost. But when Nigel discovers that humans are not the only life-forms to have been sucked into the Void, he realizes he must discover the secrets of the murderous alien Fallers in order to find a way to destroy the threat of the Void to the Commonwealth forever. But the fragile human society is soon forced into civil war by the relentless attacks of the Fallers, and Nigel is suddenly in danger of being killed by the very people he has come to save.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was impressed with this novel’s seamless blend of space opera, fantasy, and horror. It is a story that will appeal to a wide audience because of its amalgamation of many different story elements, rich and detailed world building, and shocking plot twists that will guarantee the reader will want to devour the next installment in the series as soon as it is released. Hamilton also does a wonderful job of tying together several different plot lines and characters despite the fact that these different POVs and situations are spread far apart in the story progression. When Hamilton does come back to a specific plot element or character, it is often to give the reader an explanation that suddenly opens up his understanding of the story in a major way. He makes sure to give the reader plenty of “Oh wow!” and “That’s why that happened!” moments that are the mark of a truly engrossing story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though this novel will be most likely be more enjoyable to the readers who have already read the Void trilogy and are familiar with the Commonwealth, Hamilton writes in a way that makes The Abyss Beyond Dreams accessible and enjoyable to new readers as well. If you do enjoy this novel, I would definitely recommend reading the rest of Hamilton’s Commonwealth novels in order to gain a greater understanding of the world building and nuances behind this story. There is some debate on whether or not this novel can be read as a standalone, and though I found that Hamilton gave plenty of background for new readers, if you do have trouble with this book I recommend giving the Void Trilogy a try. Hamilton is a really fantastic writer who has perfected the space opera into an art form, and any fan of science fiction would be terribly missing out by not giving his work a try.\n",

      "\n",
      "The women in this were absolutely absurd. Over-emotional, tantrums, hysteria, sobbing... Hamilton tried to write it off as the void affecting them but then why were only the women hysterical? And why did the remaining man stay rational? It was a huge contrast to Pushing Ice and Reynolds's extremely well written women.\n",

My eyes feasted on such programs as: “Welcome Freshmen”, “Fifteen”, “You Can’t Do That on Television”, “Salute Your Shorts”, “Roundhouse”, “Clarissa Explains It All”, “Nick Arcade”, “Wild and Crazy Kids”, “Legends of the Hidden Temple”… Need I go on? One can imagine my excitement with the release of a behind-the-scenes expose of THE channel for children in, “Slimed! An Oral History of Nickelodeon’s Golden Age” by Mathew Klickstein. The question is whether the work is a slam dunk or a gooey pie to the face…\n",
      "\n",
      "The subtitle to “Slimed!” doesn’t exaggerate when describing the book as an oral history. In fact, this should be italicized and in bold print as the format of “Slimed!” consists merely of quotes/interviews from key players involved in Nickelodeon (producers, directors, actors, animators, etc). Although Klickstein successfully included and received the cooperation from this large and eclectic group; “Slimed!” is a jumbled mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Slimed!” is organized by topic interview questions where the said individuals answered questions which were then compiled to form a strand. It would be overstating to call this a narrative, as there is no text aside from the quotes: no introduction, no background, nothing! The “Cast of Characters” (as dubbed by Klickstein), is located at the book end versus the beginning; requiring constant flipping back-and-forth. Plus, each section’s topic isn’t answered by all the cast and crew from one show but jumps from show to show with each line resulting in choppiness, confusion, and a lack of chronology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also disappointing is the subject matter, itself. One will learn about how or why Nickelodeon was created, how it got off the ground and was run, etc. Instead, expect gossipy tidbits which are mostly revolved around inter-relationships dramas versus the business end of the channel. Not to mention, each individual seems to remember events differently, causing a loss of credibility instead of a well-rounded view which was probably Klickstein’s intent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Slimed!” narrows the audience greatly due to the lack of a narrative as you have to be of a certain age to remember the shows and actors being mentioned (or to even care). The piece is meant for a general audience and is suggested for readers aged late 20s/early 30s. Despite these issues with organization and content; “Slimed!” does feature some notable blurbs which will heighten the levels of nostalgia with the target readers. It should be noted, though, that Melissa Joan Hart’s memoir was released around the same time as “Slimed!” and therefore both books contain similar “Clarissa Explains It All” tidbits.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Slimed!” improves with its ‘storytelling’ (term used loosely) and topics as the pages turn, capturing more reader attention. However, there continues to be an absence of expansion and thus interesting notes are never elaborated leaving the reader with unanswered questions and many “why’s”. Similarly, the reader doesn’t truly learn about Nickelodeon or the players involved because most of the time one is flipping to the directory to figure out who is being discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conclusion of “Slimed!” wraps up the work well in the sense that it asks the interviewees to discuss the current state of the channel and also highlight how their lives were effected/are now. Again, this doesn’t go into detail but it is interesting how these people are living today. Also included is a poem/after word by “Artie” from “Pete & Pete” which is another nostalgic highlight but the actual poem makes no sense at all (I don’t think it is trying to, though).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, “Slimed!” is a quick read (1-day) but it is hardly a book at all and it is insulting to other authors to have Klickstein be included in their bunch. He didn’t write ANYTHING. He merely recorded some interviews and compiled the answers. It is evident that Klickstein is a fan and wanted to satisfy his own fanboy excitement. The problem is that the reader barely learns anything with the exception of a few tasty, gossip bits. “Slimed!” is suggested for readers about 25-35 with deep childhood nostalgia and searching for a fast read. Otherwise, “Slimed!” can be skipped.\n",

      "EDIT: Okay, I am retroactively deducting a star from this book for the author being an ass-hat of Biblical proportions. Seems the guy gave an interview where he ranted about how Nickelodeon used to be better when it was all white people in the shows.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there any reason for the character to be white instead? No. But in crazy racist white guy world, there never has to be a reason for a character to be white. That's the default, and shows should only deviate from the default if there's a reason for it. TV shows are supposed to be about white people; that's just the way things are, and other races only exist for plot-related reasons. Indian children have no right to see characters like themselves on TV in leading roles -- that's a privilege reserved for white people.\n",

      "Yeah, well screw you Matthew Klickstein. You are a racist shit.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is jammed full of information on Nickelodeon's heyday, compiled from interviews with dozens of key players. Everything a fan of the network's classic shows could ever want to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Too bad it's so badly disorganized.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gold standard for a book like this has to be which wisely began with the founding of the network, covering the trials and tribulations of getting it financed, developing programming, hiring VJs, finding decent music videos, etc. Despite telling the story of MTV entirely through lengthy block quotes, the authors assembled a cohesive narrative that told you everything you needed to know about MTV in a manner that was easy to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, on the other hand, we have quotes piled on top of quotes with little structure. Instead of discussing individual shows one at a time, the author groups everything by loose themes and jumps from discussing one series to another at will. And because speakers are only ever identified by name, never what they did, the reader sometimes doesn't know that the subject's changed from You Can't Do That on Television to Clarissa Explains It All until somebody mentions Melissa Joan Hart.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Growing up, a lot of my time was spent watching The Adventures of Pete & Pete, Hey Dude!, and Double Dare, so I was interested in reading the background on these shows and see how they were created. However, this book is greatly disappointing. Rather than organize the book chronologically or through each show, a bunch of people are quoted, which results in a very large dinner party in which no one is heard. There is no context for the stories and the reader has to keep shuffling back to the list of characters to figure who is talking and what show he or she is referring to. Such a great opportunity ruined.\n",

      "Similarly: if you liked The Adventures of Pete & Pete, Ren & Stimpy, Rugrats, Are You Afraid of the Dark, Clarissa Explains it All, you will find it entertaining (one of the issues for me was that while I knew of these shows, I didn't watch them)\n",
      "\n",
      "The reasons I \"only\" gave it 3 stars\n",
      "** I saw this complaint in a few places ... the author doesn't give you a capsule on the people he interviewed until the end of the book. This necessitates checking the bios in the back every 2 minutes to figure out who was who\n",
      "\n",
      "** There's an element of \"what the heck are they talking about?\" on some of the issues (particularly with the cartoon shows) where there was a lot of airing of grievances and an assumption that the reader understood what was going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "** I LOVE oral histories ... but all the good ones I've read have narratives of some sort to break up the quotes and provide transitions . This one needed them and didn't have any ... it was just quote, quote, quote, quote quote. This made for some weird transitions from subject to subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, despite the complaints, I gave it a solid 3-star review. If you are my age or younger and remember Nickelodeon well, there are at least parts of this book that you'll really like.\n",

      "Normally with Ms Elkeles, you know what you're going to get. Nothing too serious, a few touches of cliche, but generally a romance that is sexy, entertaining and filled with hilarious banter. I might not be the ideal reader for this kind of novel, but I confess that I've enjoyed her books in the past and fully expected to find myself a new guilty pleasure with Wild Cards. Well, I'm not sure what happened here but this just doesn't have the compulsive readability of Elkeles' other books. I never expected fine literature, but I'd hoped for more than this.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writing of this new series takes a huge step back from the style of the other books I've enjoyed (, for one) and is an annoying example of the tells being very different from the shows. We're given the usual tells of bad boy meets good girl. Though, this time the good girl is a football player, which is a bit different. I liked that Ashtyn wasn't your typical heroine and I was intrigued by how the author would handle the storyline of a girl becoming captain of the football team and carrying out a typically male role (plus, the sexism that unfortunately tends to come with something like that). But what we're told - about Derek being a bad boy and Ashtyn being a star footballer - is nothing like the way they act. Derek is referred to as \"trouble\" and \"bad\" by the other characters but I can't for one second see why. His most nefarious deeds seem to be the sexy smiles he's always flashing at Ashtyn.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's the same with how much they supposedly like one another. All tell, no show. In fact, it happens so quickly and unnaturally that I'm not surprised there's no show - because, frankly, what was to show? There's this thing that authors seem to be doing (it happens a lot in NA) that seems to be a way around being slapped with the instalove label, but it actually isn't much better. While they're not exactly instantly in love, they are instantly obsessed, instantly pining, instantly imagining futures together and/or instantly unable to imagine their lives without the other. It's so strange. The characters go so quickly from getting a glimpse of one another for the first time to becoming so obsessed with everything the other person does. Even if this is a realistic depiction of some teen relationships, there's no fun or tension in reading about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The characters in this were, for me, particularly bad. Derek is literally described by Ashtyn as being completely free of flaws or blemishes... O_o ??? But... flaws and blemishes are what make characters interesting and well-rounded, they make them human and unique, they're the kind of things that make us care about them and laugh with them and cry for them. Flawless characters are bad characters. One-dimensional paper dolls. I knew fairly early into this book that I hadn't found a new favourite and it was mostly because of that line. I was already finding my interest waning when the cheesy language and cliches started rolling in.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to say: pet names just aren't hot. Not for me, anyway. And I think \"sugar pie\" has to be my least favourite yet. Honestly, I would not find it sexy if a man called me that. At best, I would laugh. Then came Ashtyn's coyness: \"I want to look in his eyes... only because the colour is so pretty, of course!\" (or something like that). I like romance when it's done well or at least done in an entertaining way but I think I need to decide to make this my last time with this author. The books seem to get worse the more I read. Whatever I'm looking for, it clearly isn't here.\n",

      "I did really like both characters, Ashtyn for her drive and sincerity, and Derek for his big heart and protective tendencies, but I did have some issues with both of them.

The roles reversed by the second half of the book, and then Derek was ticking me off for pushing Ashtyn away when he clearly had strong feelings for her.\n",

      "Looking for a really quick, hot read that you won't be able to put down and may even get you to shed a tear or two? Do you like to read about cowboys? M/F/M Menages? Really sweet characters who start out as friends and then become lovers? Give \"Rough Stock\" by Cat Johnson a try. Even though it was a menage book, and had its erotic moments, it was still a really sweet read, and not a total sexfest as you might expect. The characters were well drawn and believable, there were a few curve balls in the plot, the romance was hot, and there was a pretty believable HEA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically the story is that April Carson lives on a successful horse ranch in Oklahoma, and her father hires a couple of young boys to help out with the stock. Clay Harris and Mason Smith are all of thirteen when they start working on the Carson ranch, and it's not long before they become best buddies with young April. Clay and Mason are talented naturals around horses, and each hopes to make it as rodeo riders. During their 18th year, the boys start to take notice of April as a woman, and not just as a buddy. April's feelings for Clay and Mason are developing too, and a near tragedy the night of the high school prom brings the three of them together in ways they've never dreamed of. (Okay, maybe they've fantasized about it happening, but never believed it could.) After a lot of worrying about feelings getting hurt and possible jealousies occurring, and with April insistence that she could never choose between the two, the three best friends decide to have fun for the summer and see where this new, exciting, forbidden relationship takes them.\n",
      "\n",
      "After their summer of love, the three go their separate ways. Mason enlists in the Army, Clay tries his hand at the rodeo circuit, and April goes away to college at NYU. Years go by and although Clay and Mason continue to keep in touch, April gradually drifts away from the relationship. This results in some hurt feelings and assumptions about April being made by Clay and Mason. Until one day near tragedy brings the three best friends back together again. Mason is still hurt over (what he thinks of as) April's rejection of him. A big secret is finally revealed and it helps to mend old wounds. But will Clay, Mason and April pick up where they left off and try to make a go at a life together, or will they let the fear of \"what will everyone think\" stop them?\n",
      "\n",
      "This book breezed by so fast, before I knew it, I was done. Although almost half the book took place during their teenage years (and I'm not one for teen romance) and clearly the three friends had some growing up to do, it was very well written and their first time 'together' was pretty hot. The three characters definitely had their own quirks and differences: Clay (with his light hair and eyes) had the 'sunnier', optimistic disposition, and Mason (dark hair and eyes) was definitely darker and more pessimistic. And April, even with her tendency to blush over everything, certainly wasn't shy about going after what she wanted. And she never once wavered over who she wanted--she wanted BOTH. So even though these friends knew what they wanted at 18, they still needed to do a lot of living and maturing before they could handle all the problems a menage relationship would bring. By the end of the book I felt the characters did enough growing that maybe they could pull it off and have a HEA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually a menage book tends to get very explicit, but I didn't feel that way about this one. It was plenty sexy and had it's erotic moments, but there was nothing really kinky or over-the-top. And Clay and Mason always treated April with a lot of respect and concern for her feelings--there were really no uber alpha moments. So if you're on the fence about reading a menage type romance, this would be a good one to try to see if it's to your liking. All in all, plenty easy to recommend--4 1/2 stars.\n",

April is their bosses daughter and both of the guys best female friend. They guys are just starting to 'notice' April at the end of their senior year in high school. After a bad prom night, they discover that April is attacked to both of them and whats to be with both of them...unfortunalely they end up going their seperate ways. After Clay has a bad rodeo accident, Mason comes home on leave from the Army and April returns from New York...they end up rediscovering what they had in their younger years and finally decide what they all three really want.\n",

      "Crown Prince Dramok Clajak knows he should get serious about clanning with his long-time mentor, Egilka, but he's having too much fun being the playboy prince to settle down with the introspective Imdiko, and besides, he's not sure that Egilka sees him as anything but a young and impulsive boy. Egilka has guarded his heart from falling too hard for the Prince, but Clajak's playful exuberance wins Egilka over, and soon they've formalized their bond. However, as they begin their clan life together, they come under pressure to clan their third member, but haven't found anyone compatible....at least until they encounter Nobeck Bevau, who is everything that Clajak and Egilka could want. Bevau's reluctant to get too involved with Clan Clajak. He's a rare dual-natured Nobek..one carrying Imdiko traits, and Bevau knows he won't be welcomed by the Imperial Family. However, when tragedy strikes, Clajak and Egilka both realize how much they've come to rely on Bevau's care and support, and are determined to do whatever it takes to win him over.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's so easy to fall in love with these guys! Clajak's smart and savvy, but doesn't take life too seriously -- there's too much fun waiting out there to get too worried about being a real adult. Poor Clajak -- he has so much going for him, but he's so insecure! When he's forced to confront a terrible reality, his reactions are so very real and profound that you want to cry for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Egilka is perfect for Clajak. He's older, but his quiet confidence and calm reserve balance Clajak's playful impulses. Not to be too maudlin about it....he's the wind beneath Clajak's wings. Clajak can soar because he knows that Egilka will catch him if he falls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of his dual nature, Bevau's accustomed to doubts about his ability to defend and protect those he serves. Rather than face eventual rejection, he just keeps from getting too attached...he's willing to have fun, but nothing more. As a result, it's easy to sympathize when Clajak and Egilka mount a full court press to break down the barriers to his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The characters are terrific, the story has compelling emotional impact, and there's enough suspense and action to keep you turning the pages. Oh...and did I mention the incendiary sex? Yes -- lots and lots of torrid, kinky, but oh so fun M/M shenanigans. Best of all...there's just a lot of heart...:)\n",

      "Of all the Kalquor books, this one was somewhat of a disappointment for me. There was very little plot to the book except the two princes wanting a certain Nobek as clanmate. Other than that, the book was about these three seeing who could get the upper hand on who (sexually) and plotting to get the upper hand. Tracy’s Kalquor books always have a lot of sex but this one was centered around sex as - a Lot of it. As an aside, the model on the front cover depicting (I believe) the Imdiko is perfect. The scowl matches perfectly to what was described in the book - and the model is gorgeous.\n",

      "IMHO the weakest of the bunch but that's not to say it's not good. It is. The others are just great. Enjoyable - and good to see Clajak getting his clan together.\n",

      "Robert Foster's The Complete Guide to Middle Earth: From The Hobbit to the Silmarillion will give you just that, a comprehensive compilation of the people, places, events, etc as created by J.R.R.

      "Though encyclopedic in nature, reads more like a dictionary (which means you don't actually it) with its alphabetical listing and relatively short entries.

However, there is something called \"Tengwar,\" which apparently is a writing system. So in the end you'll get there, and this little annoyance isn't the book's fault.

Maybe in another one of Cairo's books will answer this question. Seeing how most of his books are connected in one way or another. Overall this book was an amazing read.\n",

      "Well I'll be damn Cairo!!! Got me in here sounding like Big Booty cause you did me right goddammit!!! I loved this book from beginning to end and didn't want to put it down. So what exactly happens when you do all you can to break the one woman you claim had your heart all while on her road to retribution?! Jasper had to learn the hard way just how ruthless Pasha could truly be. Big Booty had me a little skeptical about her for a minute. I swear Pasha was on a mission and stopped at nothing to ensure those who wronged her felt some of the pain and humiliation they caused her. Now with Felecia messy ass, that fool deserved what she got. She let all her up frustration cause Pasha to really show a different side of herself. Once learning she played a role in some of the things Pasha confided in her with only proved that Felecia didn't care about anybody but her own selfish ass. One by one names were being striked off the list. Now Jah was a shocker but damn Big Booty and Darius did him dirty! My how the tables quickly turned for Legend. Things surely ain't sweet when you're on the opposite side of revenge. I so loved Stax!!! He was a real thorough dude that had Pasha's best interest at heart. Learning about his status but how low key he was, made me like him furthermore. Lamar and Mel both showed their loyalty and stayed down and ready for whatever. Who would've ever thought there would be another side to Big Booty?! It took a while but Pasha brought it out of her but I swear their incident had me rolling!!! That sisterly matchup was giving me life! And the showdown begins. Oooh Jasper got what should've been done long ago. He wasn't ready but he not only got a glimpse of the ruthless chick he brought out of Pasha, but also what it feels like to be betrayed by the ones you love and trust. Aww!!! Pasha deserved her happily ever after and dude surely is the right one to experience it with. This just goes to show you that no matter how much one continues to take or put up with, be ready for everything that scorned one dishes out once they've reached their breaking point. Everyone reaches that point but some are more ruthless than others!!! Great series Cairo!!!\n",

      "Blargh. Any book which has to have a 5 page intro list of \"casts of characters\", all the way from the mains to the hunting hounds, is immediately suspect. Then another long list follows of foxhunting terms.\n",
      "I immediately felt alienated-as if the author was telling me upfront just how much I didn't know and how I probably wouldn't understand the book anyways.\n",
      "50 pages into the actual novel, I gave up. The characters are uninteresting and the plot drags. This is the first book I have picked up to read and not finished in a long, long time.\n",

      "Der 6. Band der Reihe um Sister Jane und ihren Jagdverein in Virginia. Diesmal für mich ein deutlich schwächerer Teil. Zum einen hat mir die Mordinszenierung nicht zugesagt. Tatsächlich lese ich ungerne Krimis, die Bücher von Rita Mae Brown bilden neben Agatha Christie und den Romanen um Sherlock Holmes eine Ausnahme, da ich die Atmospähre so heimelig finde und gerne dem entschleunigten Kleinstadtleben in Virginia mit all seinen Eigentümlichkeiten folge. Dieser Mord war für mich leider \"over the top\" und passte in das Bild nicht wirklich hinein. Außerdem geht es in diesem Band um Themen wie die Praktikabilität von Monogamie, die Notwendigkeit der Polygamie und Ehebruch. Ich persönlich bin ja der Meinung wenn es um Mono- oder Polygamie geht, soll jeder machen wie er mag, solange man dabei respektvoll mit seinen Partnern umgeht. Die Autorin hat in diesem Fall aber Polygamie und Ehebruch bzw. Affären der Eheleute außerhalb der Ehe in einen Topf geworfen und als akzeptabel hingestellt. Finde ich problematisch, die Meinung bezüglich des Letzteren teile ich nicht, so ein Verhalten finde ich respektlos gegenüber dem/der Partner/-in.\n",

      "As much as I love Rita Mae Brown and Sneaky Pie Brown's Harry Harristeen books, I have to admit this book disappointed me. It did not capture my attention. I know there are several in this series so I will try one more and hope it was just this book, but I wouldn't recommend this.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I grabbed this as an audio book to pass the time on a nine hour drive. It was the perfect length, and the right blend of cheesy and engaging. I hadn't realized that it was the sixth book in a series, but it didn't feel like I had missed much. The main character was interesting and complex, and worth hanging a mystery around. The mystery itself was decent, though there were a few too many red herrings for my taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "My main complaint is the talking animals. I'm fine with talking animals in a children's book, or in a book in which there is a reason for the animals to talk. This book was going along with its third person narrator and established protagonist when all of a sudden the hunting hounds were speaking to each other and the foxes were complaining about human obtuseness and all of the foxes and crows and owls had names and personalities. This isn't to say that they don't have personalities - my dog certainly does - but their perspective on the story wasn't any more useful to me than his would be. It wasn't necessary, and I found it irritating.\n",
      "\n",
      "My other complaint has to do with the shifting perspective. Almost the entire book is told in a third person limited fashion with \"Sister\" Jane being the only person whose thoughts we're privy to. Then there's one chapter (I think it was a chapter - hard to remember, since it was audio) that revolves around a married couple's private conversation. It's narrated in a similar voice but without Jane present, which seems like cheating to me. And of course there are the sudden unnecessary shifts to hound-perspective and fox-perspective.\n",

      "Putting the 'Dick' after Philip K.. Philip K. Dick-jokes? I don't know. I came to this book both as a fan of Brockway's writing for Cracked, and of science fiction in general. I really, really enjoyed this book, from the setting and premise, through the characters that make the story, to the style and humour with which it's done. With subjects like nano-technology and drugs that mess with time, it would be all to easy for an author to fall back on cheap deus-ex resolutions for every conflict, but I'm pleased to say that that doesn't really happen here. Everything feels consistent and fair, carried along by a good sense of self-awareness from both the characters within the world, and Brockway himself.\n",
      "One thing in particular that I'd like to point out is the excellent female characters here. I found both Zippy and QC to be enjoyable, funny, and interesting to read due to their personalities and attitudes. It feels like a silly thing to praise, but I really want to highlight and applaud this.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have a Kindle or a pair of reading gloves and are at all interested in the idea of a chaotic adventure through the slums of a nano-built dystopian future with a mixed bag of lovable junkies and psychopaths, I highly recommend that you read this book.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Recently reread this book, still gets a five star from me but with a better understanding of the book's strengths. Chief among them is the masterful work in establishing the setting: a colossal building nearly alien in its construction yet aggressively human in how people interact with it. No future tech is taken for granted, every aspect is worked through the lens of being a part of everyday life for the public and it makes for a weirder and better setting as a result. The author does a great job working in exposition naturally, which is good because there's a lot of it. If, like me, you love to be told minor details about how a world functions this is to the book's credit and if you don't love that, maybe skip this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The characters are also a major strength. I'm a sucker for a character who has a clear want but whose flaws prevent them from attaining those wants and just about everyone fits the bill in some way. Motivations are clear and rational but everyone's worldview comes in clear through their actions. Sci fi books can fall prey to characters acting in service of the plot rather than the plot arising from the characters and this book is firmly in the latter category.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the world and characters this strong, the rest of the book kind of just falls into place. It's natural, it's comfortable, it's goofy, and something about it is just refreshing. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "In my review of This Book is Full of Spiders I mention that David Wong somehow makes absurd things work within the context of the story. Brockway hasn't quite hit Wong's level of talent in this area. And I honestly think it may be the setting of Rx lacks grounding in the mundane world we find in Wong's books. Every element of these characters' lives is bizarre. Perhaps they respond in recognizably human ways (including accepting a lot of the most bizarre stuff as simply part of their lives). But as a reader I struggle to find enough familiar hooks to hang my attention on so that I can identify with the characters and get sucked into the story. By the time the plot gets going I'm not quite ready to accept drug induced time shifted bilocation — pretty much the lynchpin of the premise — offered without explanation. I'm a bit more willing to accept other fantastic elements of the story like nanobots 'cos they have been established in pop culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this story fell into a sort of uncanny valley. Were it expanded a bit with the time travelling drugs explained and the setting established a bit more deeply then it could have worked really well. Instead the audience is thrown into the action and we've just gotta accept a lot of story elements on faith. This can work well too. For example, this could have been a 30 page story called that would have been one of the greatest things ever written.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Rx is one of the most in depth science fiction novels that I've read in a while. The author went great lengths to explain how every bit of nano-technology and drug worked in the small world of the Four Posts. Despite it all, I never really grasped the concept about how the gas really worked in transporting people to different time lines. Nevertheless, the beginning and middle of the novel was fantastic despite the occasional area were things started to make no sense at all. What really brought me down was the abrupt ending to the whole story. It left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth even though I do enjoy open endings to stories.\n",
      "In the end, Brockway tells a great story and I look forward to his next book.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "It's been a year since I've read it, and I can't get it out of my head. I'm not a fan of excessive in-world languages and slang, which make stories almost impossible to follow. In this case, we're dealing with a society so different than our own, that the slang made the story doubly hard to follow at first. But it kept drawing me in, and it's such a rich world that I can't seem to forget it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because Robert Brockway is a Cracked author, I've seen some reviewers comparing him to David Wong. While 'John Dies at the End' is a fun read, it didn't really stay with me. It doesn't haunt me at all. If I were asked to select which book is destined to be a classic, it would be'RX'. It's that kind of book.\n",

      "“Anything he can do, I can do better.\n",
      "At least that was what Cassie Bucknell thought before she pinned on Ben Wilder’s badge and took to patrolling the streets of Cactus Creek, Texas. Cassie has been in love with Ben since primer school, but Ben treats her like a little sister. When they are picked to swap jobs for a month as part of the annual Cactus Creek Challenge in their Texas hometown, the schoolhouse is thrown into an uproar, the jail becomes a temporary bank vault, and Cassie and Ben square off in a battle of wills that becomes a battle for their hearts.”\n",

      "While the plot of this book is fun (albeit unrealistic, of course), I wasn’t the biggest fan of Ben’s attitude towards Cassie for the majority of the book. I wouldn’t quite call it belittling, but he did talk negatively about her lessons and her being a sheriff for the month. He later felt bad about such comments, but never really apologized. All while Cassie has a major crush on him. Their bickering didn’t feel like they really liked each other most of the times, so I found it hard to believe they could work it out. Jenny & Carl weren’t the best couple either, but not the worse I’ve read. I’m not really one for reading two love lines in one book, personally. Others may enjoy this book more, but I don’t think it’s for me anymore.\n",

      "Romantic comedy meets the Wild West. Such a fun read! I mean, how can you possibly resist reading sentences like this one:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He almost petted her on the head since she looked so cute and disgruntled, but he figured she'd take to that about as well as a rattlesnake to having his teeth brushed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously, this book needs to be read just for the clever word choice that's guaranteed to generate a chuckle, never mind the impossible situations Cassie and Ben find themselves in! Plus there's a second romance brewing in the heart of Cactus Creek and those poor souls are just as challenged as Cassie and Ben. It's a wonder everything works out so well! That's thanks to the cunning brilliance of the author. She's created a fast-paced plot with plenty of action, not to mention a bevy of notorious secondary characters, that all conspired to keep me turning pages, grinning right to the very end. Sweet perfection.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Reviews for this book were popping up and people were saying how fun this book was so I decided that I need to check it out for myself. I love a good, fun romance.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took me a little while to get into this book. It jumps between four main characters and at first I found myself a little annoyed that there were so many people. I wanted to just focus on the one couple or the other. Not both. From the blurb, it sounds like it is just one couple, but it isn't. It took awhile for me to settle in and know the characters enough that I cared about them all but it did happen. I became invested in each one of them. Things start out a little slowly but the momentum builds and by the end things are really rolling along.\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed Cassie and her inner turmoil the most. She is trying so hard to get Ben to realize that she is a woman and not a kid anymore. Ben is so dense. It's all very amusing. I enjoyed the dialogue and the sparks between all the main characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought the premise of the book was creative and different. The characters switch jobs for a month and Ben becomes the school teacher and Cassie becomes the sheriff. The other couple switch also and he becomes a baker and she runs the livery. It's all very comical and I enjoyed this book a whole bunch. I'll be on the lookout for the next book in this series by this author.\n",

      "Content: Clean. Christian fiction.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "What a fun read! I LOVED the adventure and in MANY ways I LOVED the secondary plot even more than the main plot mentioned in the book description. For me there's a whole other secret story wrapped up within these pages that was way more entertaining and interesting to me than just Ben and Cassie's story mentioned on the cover. The only thing that knocked a star off for me was that in the first half or just over half of the book I longed for more prayer and connection with The Lord. It seemed as soon as I REALLY started lamenting the lack of prayer to the point of wondering if this could truly be labeled Christian Fiction instead of just a clean read BOOM! the characters started praying. It was a great relief when Erica started weaving in more Faith moments.\n",

      "Genre: Christian western fiction\n",
      "Format: Kindle\n",
      "Timeframe: March to April 1888\n",
      "Location: Cactus Creek Texas\n",
      "Main Characters:\n",
      "Cassie Bucknell: 19 year old school teacher\n",

      ": Bakery owner\n",

      "Recently I read . It was a sweet book so I decided to look into another book by Erica Vetsch. has Obadiah Wilder’s youngest son as the main character, all grown up and now the sheriff of Cactus Creek.\n",
      "\n",
      "The town has an unusual way to raise funds for certain needs that come up. This year there was a need for a town pump and school books. Names are submitted, and the people whose names are drawn have to switch jobs for a month while town folk add money to a jar for whoever is doing a great job and whomever they believe should win. This year they mixed it up a bit. Two women and two men are involved in the challenge. The kicker was the two men had to switch with the two women and visa versa. A teacher became sheriff, a baker became a livery worker, a sheriff became a teacher and a livery owner became the baker.\n",
      "\n",
      "The women had very serious and dangerous positions but were determined to do the best they could. The livery owner turned baker was clueless and could only make biscuits, while the sheriff was clueless about children, grammar and (gasp!) deportment and poetry.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was amusing, had a bit of a romance and some very serious situations as the town bad guys (3 brothers) made life very hard for all four contestants. There is no way on earth women would have changed places with livery workers and sheriffs in 1888, but the story was still creative and fun.\n",

      "As a basic, surface-level look at Stonewall and its historical importance, this is fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "As narrative nonfiction, however, it's not terribly compelling. And as a factual account, it leaves out a lot of important individuals (including trans folks and people of color) and generally embraces an upbeat, \"Gay Inc\" tone which I found kind of insulting to the intended teen audience. Teens (especially the teens who are most likely to pick up this book) are aware of and able to discuss thorny subjects like institutional oppression and violent vs. nonviolent resistance, yet this book fails to really address those issues. While it's appropriate and important to celebrate the hard-won progress that has been made since Stonewall, young people should be trusted with a deeper look.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended for teen readers looking for a quick, generic look at the fight for LGBTQ rights in the U.S.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Overall, this book was enjoyable, well-written, and a good introduction to anyone who wants to learn more about the beginnings of the gay rights movement. (Including me, who picked up this book because I was thinking \"I'm gay and I want to be more of a leader in the LGBTQ community, but all I know about Stonewall is what I read on the wikipedia page. I should probably fix that.\")\n",
      "\n",
      "But I felt like this book overwhelmingly focused on gay men who (I assume) were cisgender, and I wish more attention had been given to lesbians and trans people and their involvement in Stonewall and the movement overall. I mean, they were occasionally mentioned, but if you look at the index, you can see how out of balance it was, and it would've been nice if the author could have made a little more effort to even it out.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "\"The spirit that emerged outside a Mafia-run bar in 1969 became the pulse of the gay community and inspired not just an annual parade but ways to express gay pride in individual lives. Stonewall happens every day.\"\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This was generally well-crafted and fairly well researched however, I felt it had a few problems. I found some of the dated vocabulary (which I believe was intentional) disconcerting and frankly uncomfortable. Additionally, I think that it might be excluding some aspects of the event-i.e. I was hoping to find more information about the roles of transgender people and people of color. I'd love to hear opinions from reviewers with the specialized historical knowledge that I sadly lack.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Excellent and enjoyable!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is excellent. It is an easy to read, educational perspective of the Stonewall riots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recognised as a key galvanising moment in the struggle for gay liberation, the Stonewall riots initiated a fresh stage in the political movement for gay rights in the US. At the time of the riots there was an existing movement for gay rights and Stonewall served to galvanise this movement and strengthen it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The riots led to a fresh wave of gay activism at community levels and laid new seeds of activism that nurtured and inspired many people, and which also led to a strong activism in the Aids movement and beyond to the present day.\n",
      "The establishment of gay pride marches is also a lasting legacy from Stonewall. One hopes that the activism which the riots gave birth to will continue to grow and develop until there is justice for LGBT people all over the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a good book to read and suitable for young people. It is well illustrated and the narrative is engaging and a pleasure to read. It isn't a 'dry history' book and would make a very good addition to school libraries. It was enjoyable and informative at the same time and emotional. It sets the scene and enables the reader to understand the social context of the time and shows how the activism inspired by Stonewall matured into the activism seen in the Aids movement and the present day activism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book also shows how far gay rights have come in global northern countries. From the days when gay people were harassed by police, closeted at work and denied their civil liberties, to a time of change in the present day where gay people are allowed to marry, is a long transformation process but a fascinating one.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is much to learn from this history about compassion and vision and the hope of a more just and inclusive society. It is also an inspirational book which tells the stories of courageous men and women who seized the opportunity to stand up for themselves. It shows that change is always possible and that we don't have to tolerate bullying, discrimination, human rights abuses and a denial of our rights. These are lessons for all of us whether straight or gay and this book with it's narrative is a good place to begin to reflect on that.\n",

The nice things about these books is they are good for what they are designed for -- reading in the bathroom. The format also makes it easy to skip things you don't care about. I'll likely be getting another bathroom reader soon.\n",

      "As usual, everything is again falling apart. The black witches are still managing to kidnap hundreds upon hundreds of humans for their blood ritual for Lilith. It seems like the majority of the responsibility for solving this has fallen on Mona’s shoulders. I felt bad for her, actually. She does figure out the key to ending Lilith but accomplishing it is not going to be easy. There is someone they need to find so Rose, Caleb, Derek, Sofia, Mona, Kiev, and ten others from their island go looking. They go from one realm to another in their search. And in doing so, they find themselves in one dangerous situation after another. They have to go to the merfolk’s realm and these are NOT friendly merfolk at all! Time is not on their side as they flounder to find a way to stop the black witches.\n",

      "We again, though, see the love between our beloved characters and the way they support, fight alongside, and care for one another. I have often thought during the many horrible situations they have found themselves in throughout this series, that it is this love that always brings them out on top over evil every time. Good wins over evil, right?\n",

      "So this book is the end of Rose and Caleb’s story. When the group does make it back to The Shade, Rose realizes that her eighteenth birthday is the very next day. She and Caleb have a very special way to celebrate her birthday which brings some much needed happiness to their island. But this is also a bittersweet birthday since it is the first time ever she has spent it away from her twin, Ben.\n",

      "I’ve said it before but over sixteen books, I have so grown to love these characters. Book seventeen, A Wind of Change, comes out on August 30. Bella Forrest says to prepare for a new hero to emerge. I am so excited to see what she has in store for us next. Ben’s situation has taken a turn for the worse so I am thinking we will get more of him. I am also still very intrigued with these dragons, especially their prince, Theon. They didn’t play much a part in this book but I hope Bella has more in store for us with them.\n",

      "So I will close by again saying how much I have been enjoying this series. Bella Forrest finds a new and unique way with each and every book to keep us on the edge of our seat with crazy suspense and at the same time, sighing with the sweetness of love as our characters find their happily ever afters. I can’t wait to see where this will go next.\n",

      "This is such magic. Estes works with fairy tales, folk tales, and Jungian archetypes...and listening to her feels almost like being in a dream. She's immersed herself in Mexican and Hungarian storytelling and traditions of healing. When I listen to her introduction, retelling and analysis of a story I don't always remember the details afterwards. It's really much like a dream...while listening everything is so sharp and poweful and real...it feels like I could never forget...but afterwards, a lovely feeling remains...but it's hard to recall discrete details. I love both this collection and the Theatre of the Imagination 2. In this collection I remember loving Bluebeard and The Ugly Duckling. In volume 2 The Fisherman's Wife was a favorite. On the Sounds True website you can listen to excerpts from several of her works. I did read Women Who Run With The Wolves...but I think the magic of Estes storytelling really comes through in her audio recordings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh! Somewhere she talked about thinking about what your favorite fairytale or story was as a child...and that that story probably has a special meaning/message for you. So it was especially cool to listen to her interpretations of the fairytales that were most memorable to me as a kid.\n",

      "Sometimes these classic sci-fi books are very hit-and-miss. And sometimes these BBC-like audio drama productions are hit-and-miss. But this one, from the Big Finish (technically is this book: The Invisible Man), was just wonderful! The audio players along with music and sound effects were great and I look forward to reading (listening to) more like it!\n",

      "==============\n",
      "First off: this is NOT an audiobook, this in an audio-drama. The distinction that this is more akin to a play, or a movie, than to a book. There are no long passages of descriptive narration. And this being up the second point: this is an adaptation. As the original story is a novella, this is clearly not just someone reading the novella, this has a cast of actors portraying the characters and interaction with one another. Any “narration” is cleverly handled by one character setting the stage for another character. My third disclaimer, if you will, is that I’m a big fan of H.G. Wells (yes, I know he had his faults, but I do love his fictions) and that leaves me a bit biased on his work and adaptations of his work. And the fourth thing I feel I need to point out: I’ve become a rather avid listener to Big Finish. While I started with some of their brilliant Doctor Who audio-adventures, I’ve since become a nearly obsessed of all their productions. Some are certainly better than others, but I’ve never been completely disappointed with any of them. So, I was pretty sure I was going to enjoy this. I didn’t. I it!\n",
      "The classic novella of is a brilliant depiction of the descent of a man into the psychological realization that he could get away with just about anything. While most film adaptations of this story focus on the sensational aspects of an invisible person, the real strength of the original has little to do with that particular aspect. Instead, the very human aspects that outline what a person could be capable of if you remove the consequences of one’s actions are the true strengths of the novella. When you remove those consequences, just what would a person do? What would a person attempt? How far down would a person descend? This is the stuff that makes the narrative so powerful, and the aspects that resonate so strongly even today. Why so many people miss this is surprising to say the least. But Big Finish has not. delivers a magnificent performance and, if my information is correct, this was actually his last performance. While there might have been more fitting or more poetic final roles, his turn as the titular character was nothing short of just another award winning quality performance. Clearly he gave all his focus and talent to every role he had, with his talent he could have just come in a read his dialogue and left it at that. And it probably would have been good. Instead he delivered pathos and gravitas just as he always did. My thanks to everyone at Big Finish for this amazing gift: wedding a classic story with a classical actor in a first class production. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n",

      "The Invisible Man was actor John Hurt’s final performance before his death in January of 2017, and released a month later to quite positive reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I’ve never read H.G. Wells’ novel, browsing through some summaries suggests to me that Jonathan Barnes’ adaptation of “The Invisible Man” is a very faithful rendition. It begins with the appearance of a heavily cloaked and bandaged individual at the Coach and Horses Inn in Iping and the curiosity he arouses, eventually culminating with his revealing himself (or rather, not revealing himself) as invisible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reaction to this revelation is one of horror and fear, as Griffin (our invisible man’s name) engages in a bit of a crime spree, and brutalizing a man named Thomas Marvel into to assisting him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeking help Griffin ends up at the door of an old university colleague named Kemp, to whom he relates the story of how he discovered invisibility. From there the story proceeds toward his eventual, tragic end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the novel, this adaptation is presented as a bit of a frame story, structured as Kemp and Marvel sharing what they each were told about Griffin and their separate experiences with him. Although this is a full-cast audio, the framing structure allows for a bit of narration where needed, but the narration never pulls the listener out of the action as can sometimes happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironically, the most gripping part of the audio is the scene where Griffin explains to Kemp the science behind invisibility and his experiments with it. Of course, the science here is utter nonsense, and one would expect long exposition to be the most boring part of a story, but Hurt sells it with a believable and fascinated horror of what he achieves when he first attempts to render a cat invisible.\n",
      "\n",
      "John Hurt gives a good performance, and is at his best when he gives full voice to Griffin’s madness. The adaptation also does a great job communicating an atmosphere of horror in the narrative. Invisibility isn’t a lark, and Griffin’s new-found power isn’t used for playful pranks. He descends into petty theft and murder, and his conscience is as absent as the face behind his bandages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Griffin doesn’t attempt to hide his existence as one might expect, rather he uses it as a means of terrorizing the populace with the knowledge that there is, indeed, an invisible man around — and a murderous one at that. In his mind he has elevated himself above mere humans to a status more like a god — and why should a god be subject to human laws and rules?\n",
      "\n",
      "One expects such a tale to end with a cautionary note, and Griffin’s fate is probably all that’s needed to properly convey a warning: an invisible man cannot forever hide from the invisible boundaries of society’s moral code.\n",

      "This is a powerful novel written in verse. It's beautifully told and extremely compelling, but also vividly brutal and oftentimes completely heart breaking. The verse form gives this heavy and at times depressing tale surprising lightness. However, while supremely readable and - thanks to its form - quick to devour, it's also very substantial and loaded with feelings, reflections and meaning.\n",

      "This book taught me a lot and opened up my eyes to a world full of social injustice, hurt, pain, hunger and abuse. I knew, of course, about the horrific working conditions of the immigrants at the beginning of 19th century. I have read about the sweatshops and child workers and mercilessly shattered dreams of those who came to America hoping for a fair shot at a better life for their families and themselves. Sure, I was aware of that. But reading about this in history books and then experiencing it almost first-hand through the eyes of one of the most courageous, most remarkable, and most inspiring women in all history, well, it's two different things.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was.. I want to say stunned, speechless and moved to tears, but these words seem too weak to describe how this book made me feel. I have read this novel through tears. I couldn't help it, it spoke to me at so many different levels. I felt so sad for Clara. I cried for Isabelle and Ricco. I was enraged at Clara's father and brothers, frustrated by their ignorance, cruelty and laziness so easily excused by tradition and religion. I wanted to slap some sense into the majority of men depicted in this story. All of them so entitled, so infuriating, so much more important than women and children. At the same time, I couldn't help but respect and admire Clara's unbreakable will, dedication, determination and strength. This girl stood alone against the whole world and she won. She didn't break and she didn't bend, she did the bending, the carving and the molding. Every time the world forced her to her knees and beat her down with fists and words, she picked herself up and fought on. Her fierceness and courage inspired others and, ultimately, changed the world. She was a truly incredible person and she deserves to be remembered.\n",

      "Melanie Crowder's novel is an achingly beautiful and unforgettable tale about one girl who had the audacity to stand up for herself and demand equal rights. A girl who dared to dream, who didn't let the world stomp her into the ground. I can't tell you how much I loved this book, but I really hope you'll make space on your shelves and reading lists for it - you won't regret.\n",

      "I don't know why the author chose to do this as a novel in verse - it distracted me from the plot (which focuses on an important part of history that girls should know about) and caused a DNF. I ran this ARC past a few students and they were, like me, interested in the topic but the verse? It felt like a gimmick not a necessary device.\n",

      "Living with her mother, father and three brothers in a shtetl in Russia, young Clara Lemlich's great desire is to go to school and get an education. But in her strict Orthodox Jewish family, education is limited to her brothers, who will follow in the footsteps of their father, praying and studying the Torah. But Clara has learned to read Russian against her father's wishes, and even after he destroys her few hard won books, she doesn't give up.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the pogrom of 1903 against the Jews in nearby shtetls, the Lemlichs decide to emigrate to the United States. It is a long, harrowing trip, but eventually they arrive in New York City and make their way to a small dingy apartment on the Lower East Side. Day after day, her mother goes out looking for work, while her husband and sons spend their times praying and studying. Finally, her father decides that Clara shall be the one who goes out to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding a job in a sweatshop making shirtwaists at $6.00 a week, she brings home the family's only income. The work is harsh, under grueling circumstances, with row upon row of women and children sewing in a locked room, only allowed to go to the restroom twice a day despite the long hours. And at the end of the day, the girls and women are inappropriately patted down to make sure they haven't stolen anything. But Clara also discovers public libraries and the free school, and her hope of going to school revived.\n",
      "\n",
      "After getting fired from her first job, her second job pays less and the workdays are longer. More harsh conditions and more abuse from the sweatshop owners, foreman. Once day, Clara hears the word union and, after learning what it means, decides the women she works with in the garment industry also need a union to represent them, just as the men, who are treated differently, have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little does Clara realize what forming a union will involve. Her dream to go to school and become a doctor is given up in her fight for better working conditions for the women in the garment industry. To that end, she is spit on, locked out of jobs that she needs, she's beaten repeatedly by thugs and by the police, she's jailed and hospitalized, but she never stops, never gives up. To say that Clara was a young woman who had a definite streak of defiance and a very strong sense of what is right and what is wrong, is to say the least about her. And she succeeds!\n",
      "\n",
      "Audacity is a imagine fictional portrayal of the early life of Clara Lemlich. Written in beautiful free verse, it is the story of a small, but fearless, and yes, audacious fighter. Told from Clara's point of view in the first person, the reader is privy to her hopes, dreams, thoughts, fears, especially telling is her anger at her father for denying her an education, for not working when the family is so destitute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Free verse novels can look deceptively simple, and they are wonderful enticements for reluctant readers, but make no mistake, the content is not so much complicated as it is far more thought provoking than you might at first think it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my favorite books from 2013 is Brave Girl: Clara and the Shirtwaist Makers' Strike of 1909 (which happens to be the end point of Audacity), a picture book for older readers, and as I read Audacity, I had flashes of the illustration from this book. So although Audacity is a book meant for teens, it could be nicely paired with Brave Girl.\n",

      "Visually, this book is top-notch. Levin illustrates her points with an enormous photographic display of celebrity examples from classic cinema to rappers. In fact, there's very little text to follow, which is my only real complaint. Fashion books are generally slammed by reviewers because they feature too much red-carpet and designer focus and not enough casual clothing, but what's the point of a fashion book if not to help levitate you into an interest in high fashion & bring a little glamour to your jeans days?\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from the photos, it's a pretty basic book, with the traditional \"pick your celebrity style\" (classic, boho, preppy, edgy) and follow along. The fashion is definitely geared towards 20s and 30s and current trends. This is a good pick for a casual browse for women of all ages, and deserves further inspection from a younger woman with a good clothing budget.\n",
      "Review 2\n",

      "Another nicely organized style book - lots of celebrity photos, well laid-out so easy & fun to read. The section on Fashion Personalities was was helpful to identify personal style.\n",

      "I started reading this book as if it was an anthology, so I was less than thrilled when I finished the 1st story and there were some unsolved businesses - not only related to the overall story arc but to the H/h's HEA too. Somewhere around the 2nd story, I realized Running Wild was more like a 3-part book instead of a traditional anthology. The 3 short stories were strongly connected and there was a continuous flow tying them together. Each story focused on a different couple working their way to their HEA, but the 1st 2 stories closed with a somewhat \"partial\" HEA and it was necessary to read the 3rd story to get full closure. That's probably why I thought the 3rd story was the weakest of the bunch, there was no room to develop the couple 's relationship and tie all the loose ends at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though this wasn't a traditional anthology, it had the same problems that make me wary of them: there wasn't enough character development to make me care for the H/h and their falling-in-love was too rushed. All the 3 heroes were very alpha, protective, loving, and very similar to each other. One could swap them and never know the difference - that's where a better character development would come in handy. As for the heroines, they were more distinguishable and each had a distinct personality. My favorite was Robin, the heroine in the 2nd story - which happened to be my favorite story too.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the love scenes, Ms. McCarty can write some long ones and so she did here, but I found myself skimming through some of them. They just didn't engage my attention, probably because I wasn't feeling too connected to the heroes. That's not good when I'm reading romantica novels.\n",
      "\n",
      "All things considered, this was only an OK read for me. I miss the author who wrote the 1st 2 books in the series.\n",

      "This is three stories of extremely alpha werewolves and how they found their mates which happen to be sisters. I really enjoyed this one and if the star system would work right, would have given it a 4.5. The sex was off the charts. I thought the ending was a bit abrupt which why I didn't give it a 5.\n",
      "Great book!\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Sarah McCarty's anthology, Running Wild is a fun, sexy and fascinating look into the Carmichael Pack. Donovan and Kelon are the Pack Protectors and Wyatt is the future Alpha. None of them are looking for mates, and in fact, have pretty much lost hope for finding them. You know what they say, as soon as you stop looking, that's when it finds you. Unfortunately, their mates come into these werewolves' lives at the worst possible moment. For Donovan and Kelon are sworn to defend their Pack and to uphold Pack Law, which denies the existence of human mates and Wyatt is being tested as the future Alpha and any sign of weakness could mean both his and his mate's death. All three werewolves refuse to give in to tradition however and vow to follow their mates into a new future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Donovan's story starts with him tracking down Wyatt. He needs to get the future Alpha to come home and take over the Pack for his dying father. At a bar he meets Lisa Delaney just as she beats the snot of the guy who hurt her younger sister. Coming to her aid, his wolf recognizes her as his mate. Unsure of how to proceed, he only plans to see her safely home, until he presses her against his truck and starts down a path he can't turn back from. Lisa is a pretty stubborn woman. She accepts Donovan as a werewolf but for right now, can't bear to see him shift. She's been taking care of her sister for so long and when Donovan shows up, she's only too happy to lean on him and use him to help her forget her troubles. Donovan is a pretty dominant wolf and in finding his mate, demands her submission. Apparently the female wolves are submissive to the males so that the male's natural dominance doesn't rear it's ugly head and hurt them. Lisa is human though and finds too much fun in teasing and taunting him. Their bedroom scenes were hot and spicy without being over the top. Donovan was aggressive without being bullying, but when push came to shove, he was a big softy around her. He can't even discipline her in accordance with proper female Pack behavior, even though Lisa wouldn't mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelon's story starts when he joins his twin brother and his new human mate. Donovan asks for his help in protecting his mate and her sister from the guys Lisa bashed in that bar. Kelon is a pretty lonely wolf who hasn't found his mate yet, so he comes down to help his brother kick butt, never expecting to fall for Lisa's sister, Robin. Unfortunately, Robin is dying from her failing kidney transplant. She doesn't have much time left and so when Kelon steps into her life, she grabs onto her chance to finally know passion. The danger surrounding her and Lisa seems a little more personal and marked than the wounded pride of the guys from the bar. Thinking it better to split the women up, Kelon takes Robin into the mountains for protection. While in their comfy hidey hole, Robin tells Kelon that she's dying, and that she wants a short term affair. He's just found his mate and he doesn't care that she doesn't have a lot of time left. He's just grateful for the time they do have, so he doesn't waste time in marking her and bonding with her. He's determined that whenever she goes, he's going to follow. Kelon and Lisa were a good, well rounded couple. She was accepting of her fate and Kelon didn't waste time arguing with the pros and cons of mating with a human. Both of them got right down to business. Kelon is also a pretty dominant wolf, and even though Robin is fragile and soft, she's no sickly female who shrinks at the sight of an aggressive male. When she disobeys one of Kelon's orders and almost gets herself killed, she demands that he punish her. Her noisy discipline brings about an outraged Lisa, but when she gets a glimpse of her sisters 'discipline' she can only wonder why her mate hasn't 'disciplined' her yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wyatt's story starts with Lisa and Robin's older sister Heather coming for a visit. She stubbornly refuses to believe that her younger sister's boyfriends are werewolves. She denies this all the way until she gets to the Carmichael compound, where Donovan and Kelon head to see how Wyatt is adjusting as the future Alpha. He isn't doing so good. He's constantly being challenged by the men he grew up with and he refuses to kill any of them. He's always been at odds with his father and the Pack tradition and the last thing he needs is to catch the scent of his mate in Heather Delaney. He knows the Pack will never accept her, but he can't stop himself from marking her as his. Heather has always tried to be in control of her life and now having Wyatt take charge is both a welcomed relief and a marked annoyance. Being the future Alpha and dominant to his bones, Wyatt has his hands full in getting Heather to submit to him. When he faces off yet another challenger however, Heather steps in and protects him as no female wolf would do. She faces down the Pack and Wyatt realizes he can never leave her side. He sets out for a new future, and with his mate and closest friends behind him, Wyatt determines new traditions and a safe haven for his Pack.\n",

      "Dear and Glorious Physician chronicles the life of St. Luke the Physician, starting when he is a ten-year-old child, a Greek slave in the Roman province of Syria. Despite his ostensibly lowly rank, Lucanus (as he is then called) grows up in a happy, stable environment with both of his biological parents. His master is a kind if austere man who allows the lad to be friends with his own sickly daughter, Rubria. That winter a great, bright star appears in the heavens overhead, which fascinates Lucanus, who was always somewhat otherworldly even as a child but becomes steadily more ethereal from that point forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucanus is in for a rough adolescence. He falls in puppy love with Rubria, but she succumbs to her sickness, grieving him deeply. He decides to train as a physician, and becomes locally renowned as a healer, but is unable to save Rubria’s mother from dying in childbirth (although he did save the infant, which was no small feat). His father, whom he never liked much, drowns not long after. Lucanus begins to feel that life is arbitrary and God is cruel. This hatred for the way things are is all that drives him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He goes to Alexandria to further his medical training. Meanwhile his master, Diodorus, remarries—to Lucanus’ mother, Iris.\n",
      "\n",
      "While in Egypt Lucanus meets another girl, a young Jewish aristocrat named Sara (whose name should be spelled with an H, by the way). The attraction between them—emotional, physical, and spiritual—is instant and powerful, but Lucanus is too angry with the world to allow himself to truly love Sara, or accept her belief in a loving God who watches over all. His mother and step-family have moved to Rome, and he joins them there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rome is both the crown jewel and the cesspit of the Western world at the moment. Nowhere else would you find more art, more education, more commerce—and nowhere else would you find such apathy, such madness, such depravity and such decay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucanus is an established doctor by now, and the step-son of a loyal Roman soldier. With a solid reputation for himself and a good family background, he is sought as the personal physician to Emperor Tiberius. The young man is also a great athlete and very handsome—with the fair hair, blue eyes, and height so coveted by the Greco-Romans—and the wicked empress, Julia, wants to make him her next conquest. She gets him drunk at a party and almost has her way with him, but he evades her and flees the imperial city. Her favorites, having displeased her, tend to wind up dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in the Near East, Lucanus makes a travelling companion, a man from deep in Africa named Ramus who has come to seek the Messiah, and has sworn an oath of silence until he finds Him. For years these two friends wander the Mediterranean coast, Lucanus healing everyone who seeks him, his Nubian friend ever looking out for the One born beneath that Star all those years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Greece the two men suffer violence and Ramus is blinded, but when Lucanus weeps over the man his eyes are miraculously restored. Not long after, Ramus strikes off alone to seek the Messiah. He has heard rumors of a man named Yeshua in Judaea.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all his Roman enemies dead, Lucanus returns to the Eternal City, where he meets again with his darling Sara, who is dying of tuberculosis (if memory serves). She wants to marry him, so her last years may be brightened by the man she loves and possibly a child. But Lucanus cannot make this jump, although he assures her that he loves her. He sails East again, and they exchange letters until her death. His step-brother has taken ill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucanus finds that his step-brother got sick after participating in the crucifixion of one Jesus of Nazareth, a young Jew executed for supposedly fomenting rebellion. He heals his brother, but both men are convinced that the illness was supernatural in origin and journey across the small country in search of more information about Jesus. The more they hear, the more assured they become of the man’s divinity, and soon both are welcomed among His followers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book ends with Lucanus, alone this time, interviewing the Virgin Mary about her Son, in the first of many sessions that will eventually be written down as the Gospel of Luke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caldwell’s gift for description is beyond compare. As much as I wish for an intelligent film or television adaptation of this magnificent tome, it would almost be redundant. Such is her way of setting a scene that you can already see, hear, smell, and touch it. Not the smallest flower in the garden, not the most distant birdsong, not the briefest gleam of sunset against a sea wave escapes her. Her research—reportedly including thousands of books—is clear, and her reputed mystical experiences would also explain a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The characters emerge as real, too: Luke, Sara, Diodorus, Iris, Keptah, and Ramus escapes me especially. Even those who seem a bit too pretty and perfect at first—such as our hero, whose golden hair, sapphire eyes, and perfect features never go unremarked upon—have vivid personalities and intricate internal monologues. Luke’s arc is long and agonizing, and one wishes at first for a happier ending, but the more time I’ve had to process the story, I think it’s ending is perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are too many brilliant scenes to list them all. Some of the best were the sickening slave market scene sequence in Antioch, Julia’s orgy in Rome—where Caldwell so well describes Lucanus’ drunken stupor that my own vision started to blur, and the last quiet tableaux, where Luke is both awed by Mary and reminded of his own mother.\n",

      "\n",
      "There are a handful of graphic medical scenes, including one where a woman dies in childbirth. Very hard to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "A teenaged Lucanus is molested by slave traders, who remark on his beauty and tell him that some pederast or cougar back in Rome would pay a great deal for him. He seeks refuge in a temple and escapes this fate. Later on, a gay soldier makes a mild pass at him and gets rebuffed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Julia shows up to her party in a hypersexed parody of a Minoan priestess’ garb, complete with exposed nipples. She and her ladies lean suggestively on Lucanus and every other man they can find, and they spread a rumor about a rival lady experimenting with bisexuality. The slaves at this party are forced to serve the guests nude, and later others are made to don satyr and nymph outfits and perform a foul mythological burlesque, portraying a mass rape. A plastered Lucanus wakes up to the rapacious older woman straddling him and kissing him all over. Disgusted, he shoves her back onto her lounging attendants and flees the scene. Date rape, aided with alcohol. It happens to men too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that this is the classical world, we also see some nudity in non-sexual contexts. Lucanus meets two of Julia’s other boy-toys practicing wrestling in the buff, and proceeds to embarrass them both with his sweet kung-fu skills. (This really happened. Supposedly he was trained by a travelling monk from Cathay whom he met in Alexandria).\n",
      "\n",
      "Napoleon Dynamite approves:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As previously stated, nothing sexual about this scene, but it’s a little awkward that they’re just hanging out doing martial arts in their birthday suits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing to worry about.\n",
      "\n",
      "That one time Lucanus gets hammered is about it, but it’s written so vividly that I felt drunk just reading it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some will feel uncomfortable that a few of the stories about Jesus at the end of the book are not sourced in the Gospel. Caldwell drew on the visions of Catholic saints and medieval legends for extra material.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there is the very awkward subplot involving a black man seeking Jesus because he wants the \"curse of Ham\" lifted. Oh dear. Remember it was written in 1958.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, an outstanding book for adults and older teens of any or no faith. Like all the best historical fiction, it draws you back into its era and breathes life into people long dead, and places long since fallen into ruin. It may also give you a different perspective on God, and the problem of death. An underrated classic; highly recommended.\n",

      "This book is rated as Taylor Caldwell's greatest novel. She covers the basic facts of the life of St Luke...born a Greek - Lucanus... and trained in medicine to become a famous physician who travelled all over healing the sick with the background of the Roman Empire. Later in the book he becomes deeply interested in Christianity and although he had never met Jesus, he moves around those who knew him including his Mother and Pontius Pilate to find out all he can, eventually embracing Christianity and writing his Gospel according to St Luke. The author visited The Holy Land to meticulously research the historical facts. The result is a detailed, imaginative and absorbing portrait of Luke's background, his love story, his suffering, his travels and interesting details about what in those days was known as 'The White Sickness' I found this book to be a most powerful read many years ago and have had deep satisfaction in reading it once more so many years later....exciting, extremely interesting, immensely moving and for me personally unforgettable. You do not have to be a Christian to enjoy this brilliant book in it's own right. I recommend it highly\n",

      "I read this first in the summer of 1966- my Mom had gotten it out of the library & my best friends were on vacation so I started reading it out of boredom. This is NOT a kids book BTW! The story stuck in my sub-conscience & when I joined The International Order of St Luke I remembered it & decided to re-read it.\n",
      "This is a \"historical novel\" about St Luke or Lucanus as he was called in life. St Luke (like St Paul)never saw Jesus. He was a Greek physician who as a convert decided to write the history of the Lord he worshiped. The author read extensively about St Luke before she wrote this book & there is a nifty bibliography in the back. The story suffers from the lack of modern biblical scholarship but is a wonderful read none the less.\n",
      "The part where a centurion relates what it was like for him at the crucifixion was very moving.\n",
      "An oldy but a goody!\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is probably the best book I have ever read. It is incredibly humbling to read. My favorite part is reading of Luke's childhood. His innocent devotion to God convicts and exhorts us to do the same. This book changed the way I viewed God and the way I relate to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taylor Caldwell can just flat out write. Her sentences are packed with imagery. Each word is measured for maximum power. Intelligent? Why yes she is. This fact smacks you in the face. I had to look up much of the Greek mythological references and some of her vocabulary as well. Give the book a read. You won't regret it.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The plotting in this novel is leisurely by postmodern standards, and Taylor Caldwell's prose sometimes veers toward purple, with each Antiochan, Alexandrian, and Roman sunset seemingly more beautiful than the one before it, and scented gardens hosting conversations between principal characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite those flaws, \"Dear and Glorious Physician\" is -- like \"Quo Vadis\" -- a novel for the ages, full of lush description, virtuous friendship, and dark nights of the soul. Its confident portrayal of first-century life and politics in the Roman Empire notes sights, sounds, and smells throughout. Caldwell's affection for Saint Luke is palpable, but the hagiography here rises above the merely sentimental to become memorable. Like any good doctor, even in \"primitive\" times, Luke is no mere pill-pusher. I also like that while Caldwell's language is painterly, her point of view is compassionate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caldwell shows a deft understanding of power politics. A letter from Tiberius (Caesar) to Lucanus is unexpectedly poignant, and a dinner hosted by Pontius Pilate lingers in memory as a textbook example of high-level imperial politicking at its most subtle and dangerous.\n",

      "I liked the story line in this book. In fact, it makes me want to get ready for the apocalypse now. My daughter and friends think I'm going crazy because I want to get a gun and safe now. The only problem I had with this book and the reason that I gave it 3 stars is because it had too much detail. For example the chicken wire that they were making out of construction wire. I didn't really see any relevance of it to the story line. This was just one example. I thought the author was going to go somewhere with the story by putting some of the details in and he never did. All in all it was a good book. It just could have been better.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I finished the trilogy, and they are great books. The big turn-off for me, though, was the excessive usage of two words: snickered and winked. The last word was used about 60 times in the trilogy, and snickered was used about half that. I mean, really, who winks all the time when they talk. And all the characters, virtually, in the book? So it just really ruined the books for me. I gave them four stars, though, because the story itself is good; the series, Days of Elijah, is my favorite thus far, a great trilogy.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is one of the best series in this genre I've found. It's by one of the only two authors I consistently stick with through series (A. American being the other). The author did good in \"The Economic Collapse Chronicles\" trilogy, I thoroughly enjoyed them, but in my opinion he really found his own voice and his unique twist in the genre with this series. It will also be of interest to anyone interested in fiction related to the end times from a Biblical perspective (which isn't to say it's preachy, or that I think this is how everything will work out exactly. I don't think the series was intended to be a Biblical study on the end times, it's a dystopian/EOTWAWKI novel with Biblical themes). I would also add, I see some people bad mouthing the ending. I couldn't disagree more. This was the perfect summary to the trilogy, and I couldn't think of a way to end it better. It brought tears to my eyes, which isn't easy for a book to do. Big thumbs up.\n",
      "Edit note: I've seen some reviewers complaining about conspiracy theories playing in to the book, which I find a little confusing. Granted, if you go in viewing this as an author telling you how the world actually works, I suppose I wouldn't agree with some of it. It's a book of fiction though, and to hold it to the standard of verifiable fact seems stringent at best. If this was a work of non-fiction, and the author was saying everything in the book was true, I would disagree, but in the world of fiction it's an engaging and creative book.\n",

      "I actually read the Elijah trilogy first, but as soon as I finished that, I came back to this series to see how it all began. What an eye opening experience. Of course it is a work of fiction; however, the storyline tracks pretty closely to the warnings in the bible. If you are a living, breathing human being with half a brain, you need to see where our current world attitudes are leading us. Of course, this may not happen in our lifetime, but what if it did? just think about it.\n",

Major players such as Richard's older brother, Ned (i.e. future Edward IV), are revealed as are the monk-like, insane King Harry (Henry VI), as well as his wife, Margerite Anjou . . and let us not forget Richard Neville, the Kingmaker, who at one point during his life, held two different English kings captive. During this section, Ned eventually prevails for the Yorks and becomes King Edward IV. Immediately, he has a clash of wills with his cousin, Richard Neville, and this sets up the scenario for . . .\n",

      "where Edward IV takes the throne and immediately unsettles everyone by marrying into the Woodville family, taking Elizabeth as his queen. Unfortunately for everyone, the Queen has a poor personality compared to her ravishing beauty, which creates a number of conflicts. Richard, who is heaped with honors, is not comfortable in court nor are the Neville Family, as well as many other allies. Edward IV keeps them all from killing each other and also puts up with more Lancastrian attempts to seize the throne, as well as an eventual civil war with his Neville cousins, and his very antagonist brother, George, Duke of Clarence. George also makes life hell for Richard's love interest, Ann Neville, but, in the end, Ann and Richard are married. Continuing friction grows on all sides as Ann sees that Richard is overlooking the flaws of his brother, Edward IV.\n",

His ailing health and his methods to contain a very sensitive secret force him to not only slay mad King Harry but his brother, George, as well. Of course, other reasons are used but that's another story. In the end though, Edward IV's lifestyle catches up with him, leaving his kingdom in an upheaval. Richard III is appointed as the protectorate of the realm until Edward's son comes of age, but, in truth, the queen and her people do not trust him. Civil war is averted when Richard captures the heir to the throne but even then, things are going badly. Richard loses his one blood son and his allies begin to turn on him. Worse,\n",
      "In the end, Richard loses his wife, feels he is cursed and takes a number of risky measures when a distant Lancastrian pretender to the throne (i.e. future Tudor dynasty) challenges him on the battlefield. Through betrayal and circumstances, Richard III is slain and the Plantaganet line dies out with him.\n",

      "Unusual that a first book is written well enough to be comparable or better than later books but there you have it. Penman's writing strengths are in her vivid descriptions, her real and varied characters, her build up of conflict and conclusions and, of course, let us not forget that her love stories are pretty good, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is sterling silver quality, so read it right away. Fans of George Martin's A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE should know a good chunk of this historical period influenced him greatly (per some online interviews GRRM did).\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Some historical spoilers in this review\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow. It's not often historical fiction drastically changes my view of what actually happened in history. Change my perspective? Yes. But have me questioning whether the commonly-held view of what happened is incorrect? Not so much. Here Penman makes a very compelling case for Richard III's innocence.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now really look forward to reading Penman's Afterwords, where she admits the limitations of her research, explains why she told the story the way she did, and lays out the evidence for or against certain ideas that have trickled down through the centuries. In her Afterword for this book, she stacks up the available evidence and shows some quite tremendous gaps in logic if we are to continue believing Richard III committed all the crimes he is charged with by history. I felt quite disturbed after finishing , and quite convinced that a loyal brother and good man was deliberately disparaged by his enemies. Fuck Henry Tudor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I'm not sure how widely this is known around the world outside of Britain and small circles of Shakespeare fans, but Richard III has been repeatedly portrayed as a grotesque villain. Historical fact has been distorted to portray him as born under a bad sign and hunchbacked (this was regarded as a sign of a corrupt soul in Europe at the time, though no contemporary accounts of Richard's appearance note a disfigurement other than a mild scoliosis). He is seen as a man who murdered his brother's children and seized the crown for himself. It's funny, though, how such a view grew in popularity under the man who defeated him-- Henry VII.\n",
      "\n",
      "The disappearance - and assumed murder - of the is a mystery that has never been solved, but the popular opinion is that Richard III had them killed to place himself on the throne. As Penman shows, however, this actually makes no sense. Richard III was crowned king while the princes were still very much alive. He was crowned because their parents' marriage was deemed bigamous. He gained nothing from their deaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "So who did have motive? Well, the man looking to overthrow Richard and legitimize his own claim to the throne. Henry Tudor. Who had opportunity? Lord Buckingham-- the man who appointed the guards in charge of watching the boys and the man who later betrayed Richard and fought for Henry.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's go back. Let's argue Richard have had motive because he wanted to remove any chance of an uprising from the delegitimatized youngsters. What, then, of his track record, his personality? Contemporary accounts portray a man steadfast and loyal to his brother Edward, a man loved by the people he oversaw in Yorkshire, a man who had never sought lands and personal gains, a man who had introduced legal reform, founding the so that poor people could obtain legal representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm very moved and unnerved by this book, in case you couldn't tell. Penman convinced me with her account, and I then went to do some more outside reading on Richard to get a balanced view of the facts. I know they say \"history is written by the victors\", but I was quite shook to have such a stark reminder of it here.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not just a 900-page debate on Richard's guilt, though. It's an epic life story, that follows young Richard through unbelievable horrors and loss, through political backstabbing and betrayals, and then an older Richard through the deaths of virtually everyone he held dear. Penman seems to suggest that when Richard III rode out into battle against Henry Tudor at Bosworth field, he was going out to die.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will likely never know exactly what happened more than 500 years ago, but whether Richard was guilty or not, this book shows one thing for certain: the evidence against him was minimal, and arguably nonexistent. No jury worth their salt would have been able to convict him. Yet the masses have again and again. A disquieting thought.\n",

      "\"Richard was utterly surrounded by Stanley soldiers, hemmed in on all sides. He’d lost his axe, was lashing out with his sword, gripping it with both hands and swinging in like a scythe as more and more men fought with each other to get close enough to strike him, beating against his armour, with mace and halberd In a frenzy of fear and rage, White Surrey was going up again and Francis saw a pike thrust go into the animal’s unprotected belly. The stallion screamed in agony and crashed heavily to earth, dragging Richard down, too. Stanley’s men closed in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Writing historical fiction about a dynastic struggle, the Wars of the Roses, that’s outcome is well known is a risky business. I’m sure that any reader who would pick up this mighty tome, that chronicles the life of Richard III, would know the ending that history dictates. Indeed, the author had more work to do because of this; she had to take a well know ending and make it interesting, and effectively breathe new life into it. A twelve hundred page novel is a rather large reading investment, nobody wants to get halfway through and abandon it, so this book had to be marvellous from the beginning; it had to be splendid, and it was. It really was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The novel starts with a seven year old Richard and ends with his defeat at the field of Bosworth; it is an entire chronicle of his life. At the beginning a very young Richard has just received news that his father, Richard Duke of York, has been defeated in battle; his head has been cut off and decorated with a paper crown by Margret of Anjou the wife of King Henry VI. This is a low point for the house of York as Lancaster temporarily triumphs over its foe. Edward, Earl of March, promptly picks up the torch dropped by his farther and carries on the struggle, except this time it’s about more than just power: he wants revenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "This leads to another chapter in the wars of the roses. Richard’s soldering life, and later his kingship, is filled with dynastic battles that attempt to establish and reassert his house, York, as the rulers of England over the house of Lancaster. From this early on Richard’s fate is asserted; he will naturally follow his eldest brother, Edward IV, to revenge upon the defeat of his father and the dishonour committed against his body.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Richard admires his brother; he looks up to him and respects him .He is fiercely loyal to him unlike George, the middle York brother, who is jealous of Edward being the first son. George, Duke of Clarence, is the favourite of his mother, and to make thing worse he loves Richard. This leaves Richard in the middle of sibling rivalry. This is asserted in just the first chapter and asserts the strained relationship between the brothers of York, and superbly foreshadows the eventual rivalries and betrayals that occur later on in the novel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The novelist is deeply loyal to the house of York: she portrays Richard III as a noble king rather than Shakespeare’s hunchbacked villain. Certainly, Richard has been presented as a man of honour and adherent to the code of chivalry , but he is not without his flaws. He is somewhat naïve and rash to make decisions, which the novelist translates to his political blunders made in his kingship, such as trusting the traitorous Duke of Buckingham and executing the loyal Will Hastings.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is often referred to, by his mother, as the only son of York with a conscience. Indeed, Penman’s Richard would have been incapable of murdering his brother’s sons, the princes in the tower, because he is just too good. Whether he did or not is for the historians to argue about, but I love this novelist interpretation of him: I too would like to think he did not kill his nephews and that the Duke of Buckingham was responsible.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I said at the beginning of my review, the ending of this book is well known. It is obvious that a novel chronicling his life must end at the field of Bosworth. Consequently, the author had to create a Richard that was compelling enough to make the reader want to reach the ending of this massive volume. And she did. She really did. Penman’s envisioning of Richard is that of a tragic character who was honourable and just, but just made a series of bad political moves that, consequently, ended in betrayal and his own demise. This resulted in a death that was dramtic and emotional\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I've become hooked on Richard III. We all know what he's accused of, but until recently, I've never given much thought to his defence. After reading various accounts of him and his contemporaries, I've realised that history, based on Tudor propaganda, could have very badly betrayed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sunne In Splendour covers his entire life from the age of about 7. In a 900 page book, the first third read like an increasingly interesting history lesson, but then the more personal story-telling side kicked in and it became engrossing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author has clearly done an amazing amount of detailed research into Richard's life. Whilst I suspect she over-romanticises him at times, she reasons well. She portrays him as a loyal man, a trusted brother, a beloved husband and a skilled leader on the battlefield. From what I've read elsewhere, this seems a very believable view of him. Her account of the missing princes mystery, the key point for his portrayal in history, is both logical and believable.\n",
      "\n",
      "She brings Richard to life so vividly, and I was moved by his death, I mourned him. I actually feel very riled that history may have got him horribly wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the best historical fiction book I've read to date; a fascinating, detailed and thought-provoking look at one of Englands most controversial men. I am most definitely on his side!\n",

      "Feew, that was one hell of a read. I started reading this before I started filmschool and that was maybe a mistake. Some chapters were easy, but others were harder to understand without a little background. So after a few months of studying film in all its glory, it was a little easier to get through it.\n",

      "Brown has found a way to mix art and tech together in a way that allows the reader to easily absorb a very technical field. I have many of the cinematography books on the market and I've found this one to be the most interesting and easy to read. What I like is that Brown will give you a lot of heavy technical info if you desire, but also real life practical on set anecdotes and protocols as well as art history and theory. I really enjoyed the color theory chapter with examples from The Natural. It feels like a quality book as the pages are filled with glossy photos and charts. My one caveat is that some of the photos are really too small to properly absorb. You get almost thumbnail size photos for a lot of the pictures. It would be nice if they were bigger. There is a lot of information packed into this tome. There are also quotes and tidbits taken from various cinematographers and filmmakers. I highly recommend this for anyone interested in cinematography or film-making in general.\n",

      "By far the best book on filmmaking I've read so far.\n",
      "It gives a nice and easy introduction for people completely unfamiliar with the field but also isn't afraid to dive into some more complex technical aspects of cinematography.\n",
      "The only critiques I have are:\n",
      "1. spelling errors/missing words that I discovered a lot more frequently than I would hope in a third edition\n",
      "2. there are frequent references to a website made for the book that I don't have access to because they only printed the access codes in the older editions\n",
      "3. repetiton, I know this book isn't meant to be read back to back but still, if I have to read one more time that colors aren't printed on test cards at 100% saturation because it's technically impossible, I'll have a breakdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can recommend this book to anyone interested in cinematography, even if you allready know some basics, you will probably still learn a few new things.\n",
      "I'm definitely going to have look at the other books written by Blain Brown.\n",

      "Otherwise, look some place else. Shallow rehashing of old mindless stereotypes. Of course the light is important in cinematography, if there was only a dark screen it would have been a radio play. Of course X is relevant, but that important? No.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This book provides a broad overview of the technical aspects of cinematography, and it seems to be reliable, but it needs to be edited. Often the same information is repeated two or more times in one paragraph or series of pages, and sometimes it is phrased differently enough, or far enough after the initial statement, to make one wonder whether they are intended to describe the same thing or different cases entirely. In addition, references in the text to diagrams or pictures sometimes use the wrong identifying number. Lastly, while I wasn't looking for some stylistic masterpiece, the writing is pretty dull. On the whole, the book is much more tedious and confusing than it should be.\n",

      "Some great funny humorous time spent reading this book. Though, admittedly, there were a few aspects that I either didn’t ‘get’ or felt were a little repetitive (some of which corresponded to stereotypes – like, do all lesbians actually spend all their time deconstructing the patriarchal society while munching on all organic vegetarian tofu “pizza” while drinking ‘lite’ beer? I kind of got the impression that they do from the many many haiku’s dealing with those subject matters. Yes? Oh. Okay.)\n",

      "Re: didn’t get - the ‘lesbian sex is or isn’t this way’ I got, the ‘if lesbian porn was accurate’ I didn’t get (I get the idea, I didn’t understand the haiku directed toward that issue). Ooooh, I misread the section heading. Now I get it. I thought it was ‘if porn was real’ or maybe ‘if lesbian porn was real’, which has a different connotation in my mind than ‘if lesbian porn was accurate.’ Vaguely different. That or the paragraph saying that much of the poetry was based on real porn. Made me think I was going to read porn parody – as in . . . I don’t know, awkward sex? Something like that. Which is maybe what I got. Maybe I was just tired during that section? No matter. Example below.\n",

      "Note: This review may contain some small spoilers. However I don't believe that they will in any way harm your reading experience of Tomorrow Land if you still choose to read it after you have read this review.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the worst book that I have ever read. No Joke. I mean worse than Carrier of the Mark. I hope that this will be a short review as I feel that I have already wasted enough of my life on Tomorrow Land. There was only one thing in the book that I found to be at all engaging. This was Chase/Chris's addiction which was portrayed somewhat realistically. Although this peaked my interest one or two times it did not follow through enough to be a redeeming quality against the rest of the book.\n",
      "The cover sums up a lot of what is wrong with this book. On the cover Peyton has lights coming out of her fingers. In the book she has razors instead. Tomorrow Land is littered with inconsistencies. They are all over the place. Here, let me list just a few:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Peyton's best friends name. It is constantly switching between Avery and Erin. Chris, his brother and their friends names all change but that is because they have given each other nick names in their post apocalyptic lives. Avery/Erin is just an accident in the writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Peyton's razors are four inches in one part and four centimeters in another.\n",
      "\n",
      "* The characters personalities are very inconsistent. mari Mancusi switches them up whenever it would benefit the story. one example of this is how Peyton wants nothing to do with the children on one page and then says that she loves them and they're like family to her on the next. This happens with all the characters all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Chase/Chris has silky smooth hair even though there is no running water in this zombie filled post apocalyptic life. How? How is that?\n",
      "\n",
      "* Peyton muses about how she has very little experience with kissing while she is making out with Chase/Chris (which is a gross scene by the way) and then thinks back to how she used to make out with her exboyfriend all the time a couple chapters later.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Peyton tells us that all the stores were closing due to running out of stock from people stocking up and rioting yet Chase/Chris and his group live in a fully stocked Wal-Mart. Really?\n",
      "\n",
      "*In one part of the book, Chase/Chris comes across a group of people that are \"savages dressed in Armani\" yet just minutes before we are given a description of one of the men from this group who is filthy in torn up dirty jeans and a grungy, filthy shirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind that these are only the ones that bugged me the most but there are a ton more throughout the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think that this book was ever proof read let alone saw an editor. There were so many typos and parts that made no sense at all. Tomorrow Land could have really benefited from being checked and edited.\n",
      "The dialog was often super cheesy and unrealistic. It just didn't flow. The entire book didn't flow. There were far too many things going on at once which could have made the book exciting but unfortunately was done in a way which just made it feel cramped and confused.\n",
      "I could not stand the characters. Not a single one of them was likable. They were all pretty obnoxious and stereotypical, not to mention extremely one dimensional.\n",
      "There are a ton of references to things from our time. Everything from the Kardashians reality show to Mad Max and the Thunderdome are mentioned. This book is set in the future. All of these references are meant to pull the reader in yet being as there are very little pop culture references from their own time adds to the feeling of the story being contrived and unrealistic. It just didn't work!\n",
      "At one part where life before the apocalypse is being remembered Chase/chris recalls the time that he met Peyton's dad for the first time, immediately after playing basketball with Peyton. He tells her dad that he stinks and then proceeds to sniff his armpit and make a face in front of him. Seriously? Who does that? I am sure as hell not going to sniff my armpit and talk about how much I smell in front of the person that I am in love with's dad. especially while I am trying to impress this person that I'm in love with being as it is the first time i am hanging out with them as well! God, that part pissed me off!\n",
      "The whole story is too convenient. The first person that Peyton sees after leaving the shelter is-guess who?- Chase/chris. She sees him right away, when almost the entire world is dead or transformed into zombies and Chase/Chris had left town to live in the woods. But lo and behold he is within a mile of her when she gets out of her bunker and she stumbles right into him. The same thing happens with her dad at the end. He is just there. no problems finding him, no zombies or other people in the way. He is just *poof* there. Hooray!\n",
      "It had become apparent that this was not going to be a new favorite of mine pretty quickly, however I was hoping that the action sequences would be a little bit of a saving grace. I mean fighting with zombies has got to be kick ass, right? Wrong. The action was weak. I was left very unsatisfied after every zombie run in.\n",
      "This entire book was absolute crap. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. If you choose to give it a go, don't come crying to me because I will only say I told you so.\n",

      "Yup, the first 1/3 of the book was quite annoying but unexpectedly, the story picked up its pace after that and I was quite entertained by the progression. But then, it ended worse than it started. For the last hundred pages, I actually didn't care anymore whether the two protagonists, Chase and Peyton would survived the zombie apocalypse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Truth be told, I'm currently majoring in Microbiology and I was fairly impressed by the author's knowledge about the possible properties of epidemic plaque. The zombies in this book were depicted as having originally caused by mutated HIV vaccine and the trigger was the infectious super-Flu. Factually, HIV does mutate at a high frequency and flu is indeed very infectious without prior immunity. So, kudos to the author for getting her facts right :)\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, here comes the actual review.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must say that the cover literally represents the story itself in one glance. Here we got our Razor Girl, Peyton Anderson with super-enhanced cybernetics courtesy of her father. She was on a mission to search for his dad after four years being trapped in her basement. Again, due to her father orders. After her mom decided to commit suicide, she went for her journey but unexpectedly, she encountered her ex-boyfriend, Chase and the story built up from there.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was kind of confusing because we got two parallel stories set at different time, one in the past, once in the present narrated in alternating chapters and this trend actually persisted until the end of the book! I swallowed my pride to say this (because I don't really like Everneath), but is a prime example of how a book with parallel stories should be written. It's interesting to have a flashback going on but it should only lasted for about half of the book, then the two stories should converge, otherwise we got two disjointed plotlines which actually left me detached with what's going on in the present because the knowledge I need i.e. what happened in the past was told right at the end of the book!\n",
      "\n",
      "I had several rolling eyes moments at the start of the book when the author started to refer to popular culture (hate to use the word culture here) such as Twilight, the Kardashians and the Knight of the Living Dead etc. Dear author, I'm sorry but I didn't find those as cool. And seriously, there's no need to name every high tech device with the 'i' at the front, e.g. iComm. cough *apple* cough. Seriously, the author could be more creative than that. The author also depicted the old Chase/Chris obsession over Peyton as quite sexual in my opinion. Some reviewers think that this Chris guy is cute or whatever, but I think he was just plain creepy stalkerish type of guy. So, when towards the end, Chase and Peyton did declare their love, I found it hard to appreciate the love as well...love and not lust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to the middle part of the book, I actually thought I was lucky I didn't drop this book quarter-way because this part was quite well-written. Peyton and Chase became increasingly likable and inspiring characters and\n",

      "I was really disappointed with this one, guys. I was hoping that it would take an innovate approach to the end of the world and romance, but alas, it’s like so many other YA dystopian romance books/dystopian chick lit. Mancusi could have done so much more than what she actually did do with this basic idea of finding one’s true love after the apocalypse has actually happened – and she didn’t. I wish I could recommend this one, guys, but I can’t.\n",

      "It’s almost as if Mancusi was using a checklist here when it comes to what I now call dystopian chick-lit in the YA genre. The first chapters were very slow moving and it was hard to not keep my mind from wandering elsewhere, and I just remembering sighing a whole lot. There were a lot of jokes about “oldies” and talk about the old-fashioned internet, but I felt the world constructed within the first few chapters didn’t feel very stable or original. Virtual reality? Also check. It felt like a lot of older sci-fi tropes all thrown together to try to create a world where an apocalypse felt more likely than not, and I just couldn’t get into it no matter how hard I tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn’t finish this one – I’ll openly admit that. I got to page 90 and finally threw up my hands. The pace was far too slow, any arc executions that were there were very muddled and hard to determined and, quite frankly, it badly, badly, badly needed another draft and copy edit because there were mistakes everywhere (even for an ARC).\n",
      "\n",
      "And then there’s the boy meets girl and then the apocalypse part happens – I’m sorry, that storyline just can’t cut it anymore. Dystopia has flooded the market so much that you really need to do something special to stand out, and Mancusi just didn’t do it this time. I liked her earlier work (“Gamer Girl” was awesome and I really enjoyed it) so I was hoping for something far more than I got. To say I was disappointed was an understatement.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, guys, I’d skip this one. Read a really awesome YA dystopian book like “Divergent”, “Masque of the Red Death”, “The Hunger Games”, “Legend”, “Matched”, or “Across the Universe” instead. Don’t waste your time here. I wish I could get the few hours I did spend in this sad little world back.\n",

      "I'm getting a little tired of dystopian/post-apocalyptic novels. The plot always sounds great, but 9 times out of 10 the author fails to deliver. I can count on one hand the number of books in this genre that were amazing. Yet I continue to read these books. I think I might be a masochist. Certainly, anyone who reads this book has to be.\n",

      "-The characters are stereotypical. You can find either one of them in a 2cent romance novel at your local Walmart. They are not dynamic or special in any way.\n",
      "-The beginning was difficult to get into. Oh sure the first line is actually pretty great, but it's not until later on in the book that it actually starts to get interesting. The problem is how long it takes to get to the good part. I can read a good book in a few hours. It took me a week to get halfway through this book. There were times when I actually dreaded picking it up again, but I did because I wanted to know what happened.\n",
      "-The tone of writing is off somehow. I can't really put my finger on it, but it's just annoying for some reason. Melodramatic and over the top writing.\n",
      "-The ending, which I won't spoil, was rushed. It was almost like a deus ex machina. It seemed the author got tired of writing and wanted to tie everything up in a neat little bow without going to the effort of doing the work. And after forcing myself to read through the terrible beginning, I was a little ticked off with the sloppy ending.\n",
      "-The pacing of the entire book was off. It jumped back and forth so much, I'm surprised I didn't get whiplash.\n",
      "-If you're going to write a book with zombies, you're going to have to find a way to distinguish them and your book from all the other books out there with zombies. Or at the very least, make it interesting. I felt like it was a rehash of Night of the Living Dead, and not in a good way.\n",

      "Es posible que no sea lo mejor de Bolaño. Sin embargo, el atractivo y el encanto con el que el autor dota a su personaje, Auxilio Lacouture, convirtieron la lectura para mí en puro gozo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Auxilio es el precioso homenaje que Bolaño hace a Alcira Soust Scaffo, poeta uruguaya que sobrevivió a la ocupación por el ejército mejicano de la Ciudad Universitaria gracias a que pudo esconderse en los baños de la UNAM y permanecer en ellos durante doce días con sus doce noches hasta ser rescatada medio muerta.\n",
      "\n",
      "Este suceso ignominioso de la historia mexicana es el centro sobre el que gravita todo el “delirio aterrorizado” que es la novela, tal y como tan acertadamente la califica Rodrigo Fresán, aunque lo que la hace inolvidable es la voz de Auxilio, la libertad que de ella emana, su delicioso juego con las palabras que es una verdadera fiesta del lenguaje que me trajo a la mente no pocas veces la genial y exuberante novela de Fernando del Paso, Palinuro de México, la cual también tiene como eje central la masacre de la Plaza de Tlatelolco, pero sobre todo me la recordó por párrafos como este:\n",
      "Desde esos lavabos, Auxilio anda pendiente de cado sonido, de cada sombra, intentando exorcizar el horror con esa luna que se refleja en las baldosas y le permite leer poemas de Pedro Garfias, con esa luna que salta de baldosa en baldosa y las derrite “hasta abrir un boquete por donde pasan imágenes, películas que hablan de nosotros y de nuestras lecturas y del futuro rápido como la luz y que no veremos”. Auxilio recuerda, reinventa y recrea un pasado, un presente y un futuro, sin atenerse a ningún orden, sin trama a la que ceñirse, sin tema que no pueda tocarse, sin poeta, real o ficticio, que no pueda imaginar, sin encuentro en bares, calles y salones que no pueda producirse. Auxilio siente y expresa un amor profundo por la poesía y por los poetas y ella misma se convierte en poeta en el recuerdo de personas y episodios, de esas personas y episodios que no deben caer en el olvido, porque hay una responsabilidad del recuerdo, una obligación contra el olvido que entierra a personas y episodios, que, como los libros, son presas fáciles del polvo. Lo exige toda una generación de poetas y no poetas que asistieron al final del sueño revolucionario.\n",
      "Y hay que agradecerle y mucho a Bolaño la creación de esta voz encantadora que cuenta, esta Auxilio tan cercana a la Maga de Cortázar que siente pero no sabe, que ignora el porqué de la tristeza que desprende un simple florero pero es capaz de sentir el infierno que se encierra en su boca y llorar y casi desmayarse. Asidua a las mil tertulias de poetas es incapaz de entender el glílico que allí se habla, abierta a todos para los que siempre tiene cien palabras o mil, vagabunda por el DF convertida en murciélago o duende. Auxilio la testigo, Auxilio la memoria, Auxilio visionaria del futuro y visionaria también del pasado, Auxilio madre de la poesía mexicana, Auxilio la que se nutre de literatura hasta quedar desdentada y triste, la poseedora de la poesía, del canto que protege, del canto que es nuestro amuleto.\n",

      "The student youth of Mexico raised their fists in protest during the summer and fall of 1968, marching against the government towards the violent climax of the Tlatelolco Massacre on October 2nd. ¹ Student demonstrations were organized in response to the killings of several students by the police called in to repress a fight between gang members of two rival schools—the Mexican National Autonomous University (UNAM) and National Politechnical Institute (IPN)—and were further aggravated by the upcoming summer Olympics taking place in Mexico City. The Olympic Committee, headed by an American, chose Mexico as the first third-world country to host an Olympic event, and protestors saw this as an attempt to portray Mexico as a country stabilized by American support and financial backing. Protestors took to the streets shouting ‘’ Roberto Bolaño’s slim, yet satisfying, has as its centerpiece the Mexican army occupation of UNAM, using the violent event as a nucleus around which narrator Auxilio Lacouture’s life events orbit. Finding herself trapped in the UNAM bathroom during the occupation, a subtle yet monumental act of resistance, Auxilio becomes unstuck in time, narrating events both past, present and future, yet always returning to the moonlight reflecting off the tiles of the lonely bathroom floor. Through pure poetic ecstasy, Bolaño uses Auxilio’s beautiful mind and perspective to brilliantly juxtapose seemingly disparate elements in order to paint a unified and emotionally charged portrait of the struggles, sorrows and strife of the Latin American people.\n",

      "‘ Auxilio says on the opening page, ‘’ Drifting in extreme poverty through the streets of Mexico City like so many others, Auxilio is a glorious soul that finds odd jobs at the university to earn her keep while spending her nights in drunken sublimity with the young Mexican poets, such as the authors alter-ego, Arturo Belano, caring for them as a mother while being shamelessly enraptured by their poetry. Auxilio has a rare gift of seeing the events of the world, past and future, unfold before her eyes, unlocked during her isolation in the UNAM bathroom, but with this gift comes great costs. It would be easy to dismiss her as crazy, a woman missing teeth (‘’) and crying at the words of people half her age before leaving the bars without paying, yet that would be a grave misunderstanding and would deny oneself an illuminating look into her heart and soul.\n",
      "I like to believe that one of the many gifts of literature is to cultivate a more open-minded view and to learn acceptance of others. Auxilio must face the horrors of history, of existence, in a way others cannot, and must travel to the vicious depths of her soul that most minds form a wall to protect themselves from having to journey into. Like a snake that unhinges its jaw to swallow a large meal, Auxilio must unhinge her mind—at least by the common socially accepted, or clinical, standards²in order to swallow such enormous thoughts and burdensome truths. She witnesses the pains and poverty of others, and is charged with the task of putting it all together to witness the birth of History and document it across the ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bolaño possessed an incredible gift for organizing seemingly unrelated events into a unified message. Auxilio’s skipping across time bears witness to many different characters and subtly probes into their hearts, making almost feel like a collection of short stories, with them all orbiting around one narrator. Yet, somehow through the juxtaposition, Bolaño manages to make each story mesh, creating a space between each idea where the reader’s mind will occupy and abstractly connect each element, each theme, into one larger, all-encompassing image. These are stories of poverty, resilience, heartbreak, rebellion, bravery and even an investigation into the story of and . The conflict between students and government is also juxtaposed with the overthrowing of Allende in Chile, in which Belano plays a role. While no connection is never made overt, the themes of conflict and revolution are enough to give the reader a sense of the violence haunting Bolaño . What is most impressive and satisfying, however, is the way Bolaño orchestrates a world where literature is of the utmost importance, giving meaning and validation to the lives of those who give meaning through its application to the sights and sounds of the horror show of History playing out around them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much in the ways Auxilio binds the lives of those around her into one common, driving force, serves to bind together the oeuvre of its author. As is the elaboration of the final story in , expands on Auxilio’s small, but unforgettable account in . While may be a minor work, it plays a key role in the Bolaño universe, expanding on the themes that constitute the life-giving roots of his work. The idea that violence plagues Latin America through all eternity is glimpsed, even connecting itself to his magnum opus through a hallucinatory passage as Auxilio follows Belano towards a potentially deadly confrontation:\n",
      "This intertextuality is one of the many reasons that it is hard to go long without returning to the poetic pages of a Bolaño book, creating a world that seems to come alive through repeat characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Short, yet overflowing with passages of sheer beauty reminiscent of Bolaño’s prose poems that are sure to drain your pen dry underlining each gem, is a wonderful trip through horrific and melancholy events. Auxilio may only play a small role in the uprisings, yet her small role forever transfixes her into mythological magnitude in history, becoming a beacon of hope and a symbol of fortitude for the weak and weary to seek comfort and redemption. The final pages are the most haunting, culminating all the sorrows and struggles into a song of revolution that will live on regardless of the body count at the oppressive hands of both the army and history. Similarly, while Bolaño may have passed, his voice lives on. It is certainly a voice worth listening to.\n",

      "²As discussed in Machado De Assis’ , we are all uniquely wired (or, perhaps, uniquely weird), and who is really to say what constitutes sanity. Understandably there must be clinical standards, I’m not here to disparage the psychological community in any way, however, Auxilio is a wonderful literary example of how we often write off others without truly attempting to understand them and see the world through their eyes. By dismissing her as crazy, you lose the opportunity to unlock the world and learn through her. Laziness is similar, and often dismissing someone as lazy is actually the lazy way out; even what appears as laziness is a highly complex set of emotions and actions that offer deeper insights into a person. Not that this is a universal law, but hopefully you get the point. I’m moralizing now, which makes me extraordinarily uncomfortable, so I’ll conclude by reiterating that literature, and characters like Auxilio, plead that we try harder to understand and accept one another instead of casting one another aside through negatively connotative dismissals.\n",

      "Amulet focuses on one of the minor characters in The Savage Detectives, Uruguayan poet Auxilio Lacouture, 'the mother of all young Mexican poets'. When the army invades the campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 1968, Auxilio happens to be in the women's toilets, and fearing she might face arrest or worse, she ends up hiding in the bathroom for thirteen days, drinking tap water and chewing scraps of toilet paper to survive. She soon starts hallucinating, and this slim novel (only 120-odd pages), is the record of her meandering mind, shifting from memories to prophecies in Bolaño's distinctive style - inventive, quirky and entertaining. The picaresque episodes are strewn with mantra-like repetitions and occasionally go over the top - but just at the point where I was ready to berate Bolaño for self-indulgence, he brought everything together in a moving finale, a real tour de force. Highly recommended.\n",

      "Just a moment while I’m trying to dry myself after this dive into a sea of words. A sea in which you’re in and which is in you at the same time. A sea sometimes calm (but never too calm) and other times swirling with fluctuating intensity, roaring and crashing, never allowing even a glimpse of land. Reading Amulet is like taking a nauseous, dreamy ride on a rollercoaster with a bottle of vodka in your hand. The narrator calls herself the mother of Mexican poetry. To me, she is a symbol of many things which I dare not name. She finds herself trapped in a bathroom stall during the army occupation of the Mexican National Autonomous University and there she starts recollecting moments from the past as well as the future. Memories float and grow around her like a cocoon which protects and nourishes all that's heroic and worth saving in this rapidly changing world. Mesmerizing and rousing at the same time, this little book begs for a re-read. As a matter of fact, it begs to be taken out of the shelf every once in a while for a quick read through random pages. I wonder what this will feel like.\n",

      "Damn. This book started out so good. First chapter in gives us Haden, disgraced son of King Ren of the Underrealm. Haden gets chosen by the Oracle to complete a quest in the Overrealm, much to the disdain of his twin (asshole) brother as well as his father. His quest? To bring back a Boon, a girl. Not just any girl. A very important one. One that is the key to saving the Underrealm. A Cypher. In other words, the fate of Haden's world rests on his shoulders and if he cannot complete his task he's pretty much shit out of luck. Dear daddy will probably kill him and brother will take over the throne. Haden is somewhat egotistical, but at the same time vulnerable. I knew he'd be my cuppa.\n",
      "How. Fucking. Awesome. Underlords and mythology? This was like book porn. Complete with unicorn rainbows.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I met Daphne and the book went to hell in a hand basket. Literally. Daphne is the chick that Haden is supposed to bring back to the Underrealm. She started out ok. Lives in a small town, mom is a bit overbearing and doesn't really allow her to leave the town. For anything. Ever.\n",
      "Of course she isn't a happy camper about being stuck in this tiny town and wishes to venture out into the wild blue yonder. Why? Because she can sing. Not only can she sing, she is really really really really great at it. Really. Like American Idol great. Uh-huh. Fuck, yeh. She also had this slightly odd talent of reading people in tones. Yes, people give off musical tones only she can hear and that helps her learn what type of person that individual is. She can also do this with trees and animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anywhoo, about five seconds after meeting Daphne, we learn what a moron and a half she is. Her dear old deadbeat dad whom she hasn't seen in years pops by. Not only does he pop by, but he says he now has custody of her! What?!?!! Oh yes. Some judge has given him custody of his daughter he hasn't given a shit about for the majority of her life. What does Daphne do? Does she:\n",
      "\n",
      "A) Tell dad to fuck off.\n",
      "B) Leave with her mom and get a good lawyer.\n",
      "C) Both A&B\n",
      "Or\n",
      "D) Abandon her mom and go off with a man she doesn't even know.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is............. D!!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Why does she go? Well, dear old dad is a rock star and he has bought a rock star like house in a extremely wealthy area. This area is complete with a super wealthy private school that, guess what? Has a super wealthy music program! And he managed to get her in! The name of this utopia is Olympus Hills.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Off our super special singer goes and, in the meantime, Haden also magically appears in Olympus Hills because the gate to the Underrealm coincidentally exists there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it's Haden's job to convince Daphne to go with him to the Underrealm. Not to go into long boring details (because then you may as well read the damn book), the whole relationship is just meh. The romance is non-existent. We have the typical electricity cracklings when they touch and such. Haden gets more and more like a puppy dog which was disappointing. Daphne is just like an emotionless vessel, and really boring. Maybe I've gotten spoiled lately with all the kick ass heroines I've been reading, but she's a snooze fest.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's one action scene in the whole book pretty much. The rest is hearing about Daphne's musical talent and Haden swooning over her voice. If you know a bit about the mythology, it's easy to figure out the connections. The one thing that makes no sense at all is why Daphne's mom? We meet her for all of two minutes and are given no reasons why she bore this incredibly important child. It's spoon feeding and we should just swallow it. Nope. Not this chick. Sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book was also filled with incredibly obvious plot twists. I saw every single one of them coming. From Daphne's dad having made a deal with the devil so to speak, to the missing Boon aka sister of Daphne's friend. What started out as such a potentially awesome book, became YA predictability. I refuse to use the excuse that it's just YA and I should take it as such. No. I've read many YA books that are balls to the wall fucktabulous.\n",

      "وماذا حدث لعهودي؟\n",
      "قرأت الرواية في أقل من ٢٤ ساعة، ولم أقرأ من قبل عملا بهذا الحجم في هذه المدة من قبل، قرأتها وأنا في وضع سيء جدا للقراءة؛ مرافقة لوالدتي في المستشفى حيث لا تمر ساعة دون كومة من المقاطعات.\n",

      "ثمة موهبة هنا، وثمة اجتهاد أيضا حتى يأتي لنا المؤلف بهذه الرواية المسبوكة بشكل ممتاز.\n",
      "التجريب في الشكل لافت حقا ومقنع، اللغة سلسلة وغير متكلفة بلاغيا وهذا أمر مناسب للقالب، وتيرة الأحداث مناسبة وهناك مفاجآت صغيرة بين الفينة والأخرى (مثلا أن تكتشف لاحقا أن المدققة خولة راشد المذكور اسمها على الغلاف الداخلي \"للترجمة\" هي أخت عيسى/هوزيه، أو كشف معنى حرفي MM في وشم ميرلا، أو معرفة حقيقة تشولينغ)، والرواية معبأة بالمعلومات التي من الواضح أن الكاتب تجشم الكثير ليجمعها ويضعها في هذه الصورة.\n",
      "\n",
      "القصة العامة بحد ذاتها قد تبدو مبتذلة للوهلة الأولى، طفل يولد لأب خليجي وخادمة فلبينية. لو سمعت هذا، ستتوقع تلقائيا رواية فضائحية سطحية، لكن الكاتب تمكن من تطويع هذه الحكاية ليضرب على أوتار حساسة، وليقطع أوتارا أُخَر!\n",

      "أولى خطايا مجتمع عائلة (الطّاروف) وهي العائلة الّتي ينتمي إليها (راشد) والده للبطل، أنّ هذه العائلة لا تقبل بأن تتزوّج من عائلةٍ أخرى، أو تُزوّج بناتها إلاّ حسب تقاليد صارمة: (قبل أن تقع في الحبّ يجب أن تختار الفتاة الّتي تُحبّها. الرواية ص 37)، تقاليد قد تجرّ الويلات على الأطراف جميعها، فمثلاً راشد نفسه الّذي أحبّ فتاةً في الجامعة لم تقبل أمّه (غنيمة) أن تُزوّجه إيّاها ربّما لأنّ عائلة هذه الفتاة ليست بمستوى عائلة (الطّاروف) مِمّا اضطرّ (راشد) المُثقّف والواعي والقارئ أن ينحو بعاطفته تُجاه خادمةٍ لم يكنْ لها من ميزةٍ – كما تذكر الرّواية – إلاّ أنّها أجادت الإصغاء إليه. هذه الخطيئة لم تتوقّف هنا، بل أدّت إلى طرد الأمّ الفلبّينيّة، واضطرار (راشد) الزّواج من (إيمان) الّتي لم يعرفها ولم يُحبّها، وأنجبتْ له (خولة) الّتي كانت هي الأخرى ضحيّة هذه التقاليد، ومحكومة بقوانين العائلة الظّالمة، فلم تستطع – مثلاً – أن تُساعد أخاها البطل على الاندِماج في العائلة الممتدّة، واستسلمتْ أخيرًا للأعراف الّتي هي أقوى منها، وهربتْ باتّجاه عائلة أمّها، وأمّها (إيمان) تخلّت عن بيت الطّاروف، وتزوّجت بآخر ونسيتْ فيمن نسيتْ حتّى ابنتها (خولة) هذه!!!\n",

      "- الأوّل: حينَ مات (ميندوزا) ماتت بعده بأسبوع (إينانغ تشولينغ)، وطوال الرّواية من أوّلها حتّى صفحة 176 ظللنا نظنّ أنّ (إينانغ) ما هي إلاّ امرأةٌ طيّبة عند بعضهم، وساحِرة عند آخرين كان النّاس يُشفِقون علها أحيانًا بوضع بعض أطباق الطّعام أمام باب غرفتها دون أن يدخلوا الغرفة إمّا خوفًا أو تطيُّرًا، ولم يَدُرْ في خَلَدنا البتّة المُفاجأت الّتي صُعِقنا بها في نهاية هذه المرأة، فأوّل المفاجآت أن جدار غرفة (إينانغ) ظلّ طيّ الكتمان حتّى ماتت، وحينَ دخل بعض الجيران غرفتها رأوا صور الجدّ (ميندوزا) تزيّن هذه الجدران بأشكال مختلفة، وأوحى لنا الكاتب أنّ (ميندوزا) الجدّ الّذي خدم في سِلك العسكريّة له مُعجَبات ومن ضمنهنّ (إينانغ)، وهذا ما وقَر في ذهن (ميرلا) أيضًا، ولكنّ المفاجأة الّتي أطلقتْها (آيدا) كانت صاعقة؛ إذ تبيّن أنّ (إينانغ تشولينغ) هي أمّه لـ (ميندوزا)، وحينها لن تستطيع أن تُمسِكَ العبرات الذّارِفات من عينِك وأنتَ تتخيّل مدى قساوة الابن الّذي عزل أمّه في غرفةٍ لا يراها فيها أحدٌ ولا ترى أحدًا طوال هذه السّنين وكيفَ كتم عن الجميع تقريبًا خبر أنّه هذه العجوز الّتي تُزدَرى هذا الازدِراء هي أمّه. غير أنّ المفاجأة الأكبر ستكون حينَ يسأل البطل خالته (أيدا): (تلك العجوز والدة ميندوزا... من يكون والده) فيأتي الجواب الصّافِع: (ليس له أب...) وكأنّ الجواب يريد أن يُذكّر البطل بأنّه لا أب له، وإن كان في الحقيقة موجودًا إلاّ أنّه أبٌ غائبٌ أو مقتولٌ أو مفقودٌ أو سمّه ما شِئت.\n",

      "- الثّالث: أنّ الكاتب أوحى لنا عبر صفحات طويلة في الثّلث الأخير من الرّواية أنّ (ميرلا) غابت عن الوجود فترةً طويلة، وانقطعتْ رسائلها، وووقعْنا في وَهْم أنّها انتحرتْ، وجاء الكاتب لنا بقصّة (إبراهيم سلام) الّذي يُترجم أخبار الفلبّينيّن من العربيّة إلى الفلبّينيّة، ورمى بين أيدينا بخبر فتاة فلبّينيّة تنتحر، فينصرف الذّهن إلى أنّها (ميرلا)، وتموت بالفعل (ميرلا) من ناحية الظّهور في هذا الثّ��ث الأخير من الرّواية، إلاّ أنّها تعود للظّهور بشكلٍ مُفاجِئ وصاعِق في النّهاية، وهي تنعم بالدّفء والأمان مع زوجها وابنهما، فيقول على لسان البطل: (سأترك ورقتي الأخيرة هذه لأتفرّغ لمشاهدة وجه صغيري المطمئنّ في نومه بين ذراعيّ أمّه) (الرّواية ص396).\n",

      "Review 1\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I have never read a book by John Warley. This book is associated with, \"Story River Books,\" and the editor at large is Pat Conroy. There were many times in this book when I certainly believed passages were written or heavily edited by Pat Conroy, he has a very specific southern voice that is in this novel. If you like Pat Conroy novels I do believe you would enjoy this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story begins in 1978, When Elizabeth, wife of Coleman Carter seriously decides she wants to adopt a child from Korea. She is already determined to get her husband to agree, but unlike Elizabeth who is not from the south, Coleman was born and raised a southern in Charleston, SC, and his heritage runs deep. His family is set in their ways of southern traditional values and yes they at times tend to exclude people not so much outwardly but within their societies in which they have been ingrained for many years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes it is difficult to determine just what this novel is going to be about and is about, but at the heart of it is Coleman coming to terms with the quiet racism and not so quiet racism that has always existed in his southern city of Charleston. This book meanders about from Elizabeth's perspective, to Coleman's to Hana who took care of Soo Yun, the Korean baby who was left on the doorstep of the orphanage, to the Vietnamese restaurant owner, to the various people Coleman comes in contact with. We never get to hear from Allie (born Soo Yun). 80% of this book is about Coleman dealing with raising his daughter just fine until she is excluded from an event which he, his father and his grandfather attended, and to attend you must be born of the blood of the ancestors. People who are adopted are excluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story gets a bit long in places, and there are parts that could have been eliminated, but not so much that it was overly irritating. I did enjoy hearing the voice of Pat Conroy. I found it refreshing to read about racism not in overtly way, but rather how it so often really does occur, quietly. This is a story about traditions and the feeling of knowing you are among an elite group of people but of course that can't happen unless you are excluding others, because well then you might not be that special if just anyone can attend.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Readers under the scuppernong vine are about to claim the discovery of the next great Southern Writer. I just finished John Warley’s A Southern Girl.I thoroughly enjoyed reading how the Coleman Carters take on challenges to their comfortable family life and Southern culture that come with the addition of an adopted daughter from South Korea. John Warley triumphs in telling the story with tact and well placed humor. How Southern is that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Warley describes his characters and events with a very sharp pen. For example, in an early chapter a very reluctant Jong Sim is taking her infant to an orphanage for adoption in Seoul, Korea. Warley's voice for Jong Sim is very believable and “sweet”. John, a former college athlete, is a tough man. The vivid gentleness he uses to describe this scene shows he is also an accomplished word smith. Right away I was pulling for something outstanding to happen for this young babe. Well, life is just not that easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Warley is especially adept at creating interesting well developed characters in this his seminal work. One of my many favorites is Margarite Huger. Margarite’s deceased son was Colman’s best friend. In an inner story scene filled with subtle emotion and joy Colman tells Margarite about his and Philip’s adventures in San Miguel, Mexico. This is a coming of age story for two young men filled with the sights, sounds, colors, dogs, and roosters of Mexico---and oh yes one very beautiful young woman! This, is one of many, scenes in the subplot that John Warley applies meaningfully to the big story. If I could tell you any more I would be writing the book myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main environment for A Southern Girl is Charleston, SC. You will see that Warly knows this story world as a home he loves, a home he eagerly returns to from Virginia. However, soon after returning he vividly shows Colman searching for moral courage to support his daughter in the comfortable environment of lifelong friends. Colman learns that some of his beloved traditional Charleston institutions are devoted to sacred cows with questionable norms that result in sower milk. Coleman says he does not like confrontation but I ask you to decide on this when you meet him.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I really wanted to love \"A Southern Girl\" because my husband recommended it and appreciated it. Unfortunately, I found the writing to be ponderous, the storyline plodding and uneven, and the characters often unlikable. The first part of the novel, using the points of view of Allie's birth mother, her orphanage nurse Hana, and her adoptive parents Elizabeth and Coleman, was good reading. The book lost steam midway through when Coleman's voice took over. I found the journey to Korea and Vietnam interesting, but the novel's climax and resolution was predictable. Seriously. If you want to read a great book about Charleston either past or present, read ANYTHING by Pat Conroy or \"The Invention of Wings\". \"A Southern Girl\" pales in comparison.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "So much to applaud about this book. Stories with Charleston as the centerpiece always are appealing. The cultural aspects are not surprising if you are from the south. The journey to Korea was the reality check needed for the son of the south attorney. I loved all the characters even the ones with \"warts\". This author impresses and will read more.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I really wanted to love this book, as Pat Conroy recommended it. Written similarly to Conroy's style, it started out so promising. But, as other reviewers stated, it seemed like two stories, and became meandering and slow, so that I was ready for it to end.\n",

      "OMG it was so hard for me to read this entire story. I really didn't like it and if it had been any longer, I wouldn't have been able to finish.\n",
      "At first Luc and Logan were ok guys. Way too alpha and dominating but then when they got so mean and cruel to Cassie, that did it for me and I couldn't stand them. What friction' jerks. And if they called Cassie \"sugar\" one more time, gah.\n",
      "This story was so disjointed and confusing at times but I chalked some of that up to not having read the previous books which btw, I Will Not be doing.\n",
      "I didn't really care for Cassie either. One minute she was helpless and crying and the next she was wonder woman and could take care of herself.\n",
      "I like BDSM stories but I gotta say the dominating and spanking were over the top.\n",
      "This story and I think whole series is not my cuppa.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I seem to be in the minority on not caring much for this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cassie swung wildly between being smart enough to handle herself and being TSTL. And one minute she was too emotionally damaged to function then in the next she was screaming out her orgasm. Agh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her doms did little to help her stay balanced in the midst of chaos. First the guys don't believe her, lock her up and threaten her. Then they coerce her into signing a submission contract with them. Yep. That is a great way to get your D's relationship rolling. Does all of this upset our darling heroine? Apparently not. Apology accepted boys - let's get it on! It left my head spinning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The menage sex scenes were nice (who doesn't like to read about perfect people having perfect sex?) but they did little to distract me from the yo-yo emotional state of all the characters.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The plot thickens\n",
      "\n",
      "The danger to the Ramsey clan continues and this time is Cassie, the hot but sweet profiler Luc and Logan have taken a liking to. Her dark past and the secrets it ties in with the on going danger means you have a hot and steamy page Turner.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Out of the three books in this series that I have read, this one is my favorite. I loved the human dynamics between Cassie, Luc and Logan and the drama and suspense was even higher in this book. I had times I cried for Cassie and wanted to shoot Luc and Logan, along with the other men in this series and then those twins would turn around and I found I was fighting just as hard as Cassie was to not forgive them. Those two men were hard to be mad at for very long.\n",
      "From the synopsis you can tell Cassie didn’t have an easy road in life. What you don’t know is that she is one strong, kick butt woman who knows how to defend herself. She put those twins, Luc and Logan through hell before she allowed them in her heart. With the guilt she felt over the deaths of her father and other family members she shut herself off from people. The secrets she carried were weighing heavy on her already but when the memories started coming back she fought between her sanity and doing what she needed to do so the evil would be brought to justice. This is where Luc and Logan enter the picture with the Dom mentality of conquering the world and the woman they want, they were sure they were just what Cassie needed. If Cassie gives in and becomes their sub will they allow her to still pursue the men who raped and tortured her and killed her family or will they expect her to give that mission over to them as she stays in the kitchen wearing a dress, no underwear and baking cookies.\n",
      "The twins are proficient in hunting down the bad guys and protecting their women. With a military background and a dominant attitude there is no monster that can’t be killed, but what do they do with the woman they love who is also trained to take down the monsters…..unless she is curled up in a fetal position having a panic attack from the sudden flashbacks. They are going to have to find a balance with this woman, one that will allow them to protect her yet build the trust in her so they can take care of her when she breaks. As far as the Dom/Sub relationship this was also going to be tricky. Her hard limits are long and include the basics of restraints and blindfolds. Vowing to find the men who hurt her and destroyed her sexual freedom they also decided to bring her back to life. They wanted her to find peace and freedom, even medicine and therapy hadn’t been able to make a dent in her walls, but they were sure their love and affection could.\n",
      "The author did a wonderful job with balancing the personalities of all three characters. Logan and Luc were as different as night in day in the personality category. What one didn’t have an ounce of the other carried the full dosage. Logan was fun and witty, loving and expressive. Luc was shut off, straight faced and serious. Cassie was a great balance of both and easily flowed with the man she was with. She found a way to adapt to her two men, keeping each of them just as they are and finding that she had what they both needed to blend into a very happy threesome. Cassie’s story hooked me from the beginning. I was stressing through most of the book wanting her to find her answers, for her wisdom and survival attitude to shine and show those men that a woman could defend herself. I also loved those moments she crumbled into the men’s arms and just let them love her.\n",
      "I am in love with this series and I can hardly wait to read Zane’s story. There is an underlying connection of suspense throughout this series bringing each book together and making it a great story. Addison and Jenna are back to their crazy ways and I am finding I adore them more with each book, now they have added a few other women into their circle so the drama should only increase with Zane’s book.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I started by reading the first one in the series and I love them more and more. It seems like the more I read the more I want them. I've seen the next book and can't wait to read it. It looks like a great and exciting read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cassie Edwards has been hiding a part of herself since she was seventeen years old. She's had plenty of people that asked her what happened when she was abducted for two days. It is more than she wants to tell anyone. She stays away and they can't understand that she is protecting everyone. She was told to never tell anyone and she broke that promise to her dad. That night her father was killed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Logan and Luc Ramsey are identical twins and do everything together. They also have their own language. These two have one of the greatest jobs around. They run Club Mystique along with their three brothers. Now this isn't your normal club, in this one you get to experiment and let the guy be in charge of all your passions. You can only let go as long as you trust your partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book has some M/F/M love scenes. Alright they have it all the way through the book,this is a book about BDSM. It is so hard not to say much because it is such an exciting book. I will let you on a little secret. Someone in the book loves to eat strawberry ice cream with spinach. Just thinking about eating that together makes me sick.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author did a wonderful job with the story and the characters. I love watching them all together. You seen how much all three wanted each other but everyone fought it but Logan. He knew that she was the woman for them and he didn't mind the pact of them breaking the 32 year rule. You could just fell the emotions of all three and it really makes you really hot. Just thinking about being in the middle of two strong guys like that makes me wish I could really try it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is really close to real life. You have a couple, plus one more trying to figure out how to be themselves and the person that they are meant to be. Yes they make some bad decisions and they have some problems trusting each other. But at the end they are there for each other and the love they share is there for everyone to see. This book is more than just hot sex. There is some suspense and a problem that needs to be solved before someone else Cassie loves ends up dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will leave you with the words I said. This is a great book with an amazing author that really knows how to write a story. As you read you feel all the emotions that each character is feeling and you wonder what will happen next. Now I'm on to the next book in this great series. Don't just take my word for it, give it a chance.\n",

      "Review 1\n",
      "==============\n",
      "What if Sister Carrie were black? ish? Harlem Renaissance author Jessie Redmon Fauset reminds me of no one more than Theodore Dreiser. Both are concerned with single women trying to make it on their own terms, and neither is particularly skilled at writing. Dreiser is better - more powerful in the end, less susceptible to Victorian plot twists, and less moralistic - but this is good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weird to say moralistic, given that Plum Bun advertises its lack of moral in the title, but the title is a lie: there are morals galore here, about pride in ancestry and the importance of family and proper behavior and what have you, and they're not subtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe I should be comparing her to Jane Austen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passing, which is where a light-skinned black person decides to define herself as white, was of vivid interest to the Harlem Renaissance writers. It shows up in Nella Larsen's terrific the best treatment of it; it's also covered satirically in George Schuyler's and awkwardly in actual life. We don't talk about it so much anymore. Both black and white people find it...what, gauche? I don't know. The last time I heard about passing was when Rachel Dolezal tried a reverse pass. (That's the woman who was head of the NAACP until her Caucasian parents released a statement like, hey, btw, let's make Thanksgiving awkward.) Given its frequent discussion a century ago, I would assume that many black people made this decision at some point previous, and now it's in the past, their families have been white for generations. Suck it racists, I guess?\n",
      "\n",
      "We're still stuck on the idea that a drop of black blood makes one black, which is sortof weird and ugly. What if a person of mixed race, like Barack Obama, just declared that he was white? Why shouldn't he? The very definition of passing sucks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, that's what is about. Fauset, who had siblings who could pass, is against it. Her protagonist, Angela Murray,\n",
      "This is all handled adequately well.\n",
      "\n",
      "is at its best, though, describing loneliness. Here too there may be autobiographical elements: like Angela, Fauset moved alone to Harlem, and the poignancy of her description of loneliness in New York City feels very real. I loved these parts of the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "They're not enough to make me love the whole thing, which totters into Victorian melodrama at a certain point and then proceeds to drown in it. Angela's sister Virginia\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "E.B. White opens with what could be the epigram to this book:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Angela uses the privacy to reinvent herself, but she ends up realizing that you can't have one without the other. The book is about that choice: both or neither.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Overly erudite. Corny ending. Nothing much really happens in the book. In short, I enjoyed it!! An anthropological treasure. Its like a time capsule with this young, black, female author struggling for attention and respect both as a woman and as a negro. I am not describing the plot of the book, I'm stating my perception of how the author came across to me in the telling of the story. The story itself was not that complex. A coming of age story of a young woman in the 1920s who attempted to pass and found out she'd rather be who she was. Her journey was the story. Simply fascinating.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Written at the height of the Harlem Renaissance, this is one of those novels that isn't nearly as widely read as it should be. Fauset's novel is so readable as to often seem casual, but the heart of the story is a detailing of psychology related to racism, sexism, and the question/process of \"passing\". By focusing on a young African American girl who wants nothing more than to be a free woman and artist, Fauset tracks her young protragonist through Philadelphia and then New York with a constant eye toward the politics of her life. Because the focus of the novel is on the personal psychology of characters, as opposed to larger politics affecting society, the book and protagonist might come across as deceptively simple, or even selfish. Instead, the novel works to provide a picture of simple, and even realistic, survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, Fauset's subtitle, \"a novel without a moral\", is both important and careful. As prolific and involved as Fauset was during the Harlem Renaissance, there's no question that this work is never without thought, but it is also incredibly engaging and readable, maybe so much so that its very readability has allowed it to be overlooked when we look back at the serious literature of its time. Plum Bun: A Novel WIthout a Moral is, though, a pointed critique of anyone who would attempt to call \"passing\" a simple matter of morality, pride, or confidence--it is a serious work of fiction, worth reading and considering, that sheds real light onto race and gender politics of the early twentieth century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simply, this may be a book you haven't heard of...but it shouldn't be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely recommended.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "1929. The Harlem Renaissance: the high-swinging days of Langston Hughes, Richard Wright and Zora Neale Hurston. These names produced some of the most recognizable and justifiable literature in the 20th century. Stories of jazz, sexuality and freedom bloomed from the minds of these poets and novelists.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a time when ideas pollinized the cities’ streets, very few names could be spotted on the radar and could be etched into time. Writers like Jessie Redmon Fauset published their works and passed on as if they were the racially passing characters in which they wrote. The protagonist in Plum Bun, Angela Murray, realizes that she can pass for white. Throughout the novel, this proves itself as an advantage and a disadvantage. Fauset creates a character who in some capacity is both static and dynamic. She characterizes Angela as a conflicted, naïve woman who will never understand what it is to be true to oneself.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This book feels so modern and fresh that, if it wasn't for the cool-girl-from-the-1920's writing style, I'd say it was published today. The characters are all amazingly layered, their relationships compelling, and the whole narrative had a movie-like aspect to it that it makes me sad that we're unlikely to see an adaptation any time soon. The last third of the book also had the twists and turns you'd see in a Brazilian telenovela, which is delightful considering\n",
      "the love interest is a half-Brazilian man, and by the end I was grinning so much that I even felt a little bit silly. Loved it!\n",

That being said, upon a bit of research, it's clear that the author fully believes in the Celestine Prophecy, and has dedicated his life to it. The way the book itself reads, however, is a bit lackluster. It always felt as if it was leading up to some grand reveal, some climax, only for it to fall short at every turn.\n",

      "As we grow into adults and look back over our childhood years, we may discover things from our past that are like a lion ready to pounce and open old wounds. Omegia Keeys has had many detrimental experiences throughout her life that they sit upon her like a lion ready to attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Omegia Keeys grew up with a house full of siblings in a single parent home. As a child, her mother was a truck driver and not home much, so she relied on her siblings to take care of her. As she grew older, she took care of herself. Omegia was not a child who sought out trouble but trouble and heartache always seemed to find her. She had a passion for running track and excelled to become a potential Olympic contender, but gave it all up because her past continued to show its ugly head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not being able to get past two rapes and molestation, Omegia took to drinking. When she learned that she was pregnant, for the second time in her life, Omegia didn't want to keep the baby but knew she could not put him up for adoption. When she gave birth, Omegia had a difficult time bonding with her son, due to his conception, but later began to love him dearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rise and Fall of a Track Star\" was emotionally written. You could almost feel the pain and anger that Omegia Keeys experienced. This book could be used as a self-help book for victims of rape, molestation, or those who simply experienced some of the pain that Omegia went through. She had a troubled past, although at one point in her life she was on top of the world. I must say though, she closed many people out of her life and missed out on times of healing. To talk is to heal just as needing to be heard is to heal. This book is a reminder that it is important for parents to have an open relationship with their children just as children should have an open relationship with their parents, even if they have to scream to the rooftop to be heard.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Does anyone listen when a child is saying that he or she has been victimized? Does the child fear telling someone? Or should the child keep it bottled inside? In Rise and Fall of a Track Star by Omegia Keeys readers will learn about one situation where the child had no choice. Omegia Keeys was raised by a strong woman who did her best to provide for her seven children. Omegia is the youngest and came along eight years after her older siblings. She is a bright student with a love for track because running gave her the freedom she needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day Omegia’s bright light starts to dim after someone she knew assaults her. Omegia tries to deal with her emotions through alcohol. When Omegia finds out she is pregnant her whole life changes because every day she is reminded of her assault. Omegia continues to turn to track as a relief mechanism that helps control her emotions and to forget the negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rise and Fall of a Track Star is about a teenager struggling to move past her assault and controlling her emotions. As a teenage mother, I can relate to the emotional experience the author endured. I applaud this author for sharing her personal and private information in hopes of helping others. This book is a testimony that you can rise above alcoholism, peer pressure and disappointment. I recommend this book to others.\n",

      "Rise and Fall of a Track Star by Omegia Keeys was definitely not what I was expecting. This title will have you feeling so many emotions as you flip through the pages. I give her credit for putting it all out there like she did.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There were times I was angry at her mother, then at her friends, because really? How could friends do that to you? In the end though, I was left with a strong respect for Omegia and her Mother, feeling sorry for all this woman and child had to endure yet amazed at the strength she portrayed through it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are not touched by this story, then you are just completely heartless. Instead of her experiences breaking her, she found the strength to survive. Kudos Omegia! There are several messages involved in her story, the one that stands out for me is to never let your dreams die. This is a very fast paced, intriguing story that you will find you can't put it down until you are finished just to see how it all ends. She holds nothing back and I can only imagine how hard it was to write it all down, then bare it for the world to see. I highly recommend Rise and Fall of a Track Star, giving it 5 lattes!\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I recently had a chance to read a very deep and heartfelt story, “Rise and Fall of a Track Star“. It was a look inside the life of, Author Omegia Keeys, a woman who endured a life of struggles and pain from abuse, trust issues, depression and teen-age pregnancy, growing up. She was able to put away most of what she was going through on track. Running track was an escape for her and where she rose to star status only to walk away from it all later. While some of us who may have gone through similar things in life, choose to stay silent, she has taken the step to speak out and share her story with the world. This takes and shows a woman with courage who is able to reach in to pull out that inner strength. Not only has sharing her story helped her to become stronger but this story, I’m sure, will help the many other’s going through similar things in their lives. I applaud her and wish her continued strength.\n",

      "This book contains two of Hubbard's pulp Westerns, Come and Get It from the October, 1938 issue of Western Story Magazine and the titular story from the March, 1937 issue of All Western Magazine. Both tales feature young men who claim their rightful fortunes against terrific odds with perseverance and courage and determination. I thought Cattle King for a Day was the better of the two since Come and Get It intentionally misleads the reader (or perhaps just withholds necessary information) into drawing the wrong conclusion right up to the end. They're both good, standard pulp Western fare.\n",

      "Wendy Ewald is a renown photographer with over forty years of experience capturing women, children, and families in their communities. She has traveled to over ten countries, in which her images tell a thousand stories, capturing the identity and culture of many groups of people. Her book The Best Part Of Me integrates collaboration and self love, as children write about their favorite body part directly on the photos Ewald has taken. This immediately caught and held my attention, as it adds value to the sentiment of the book. Ewalds experience in photography allows her images to be a subtle background or prop, where the reader immediately sees the children’s words, but the picture slowly pulls our attention. The images ultimately add depth to the children’s poems. Ewald encourages children to love themself and their flaws. One of my favorite pages talked about the scars on a girl's knees, the design of the scar and how it reminds the child of summer time, probably the season in which she fell and got the scar. Her book encourages out of the box thinking and because it is written by children for children, most children can relate to the words and images shown. Most importantly, Ewald shows the drastic diversity of each individual person and what they value.\n",

      "\"What is the best part of you?\", and presents their answers in this sometimes funny, sometimes moving, deeply personal book that includes striking black-and-white photographs taken by the author. Ideal for parents and teacher to use to discuss body image, self-esteem, and diversity with children.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Enjoyed reading this photographic picture book. Kids selected one part of their body they liked best then wrote about it. Lots of lesson plans out there. Makes for a great get to know you writing activity. Easily differentiated. Ss can go beyond the obvious uses of the body part.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This book is beyond cool. It's the coolEST (book that blends photography, pride in body-image, and narrative poetry, that is). I was first introduced to \"The Best Part of Me\" during my summer with the Oklahoma Writing Project when a teacher colleague modeled how she used the book with her 5th graders. I immediately incorporated the text into my syllabus for the fall semester, eagerly anticipating collaborating on this creative composition with my pre-service teaching students.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy Ewald's book is special, and the premise seems so simple. As per the cover, \"children talk about their bodies in pictures and words.\" The pages follow a pattern: black and white photograph of a child's favorite feature (nose, teeth, eyes, etc.) followed by their poetic ode to their \"best part.\" The book is not simple though; the message is incredibly strong. These self-portraits are powerful revelations about pride, individuality, culture, relationships, expression, and exercises in creative candidness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward post-summer to reading the book with my class of educators, slowly pausing together to absorb the details in each students' special photograph, and laughing with the kids' sweet and clever narratives (\"Sometimes I can move my teeth. Sometimes my gramma can move her teeth too.\"). My students and I each took our own photos and wrote odes to the best parts of us (cue laughter about making sure everything stayed G-rated), and shared them on a particularly special night in class. We laughed, smiled, and got teary as journeys with insecurities, pride in familial features, and quirky takes on our compositions were showcased. We talked teaching moments and how else this book could be used - What would characters in a novel say was the best part of them? What if we looked for non-physical attributes? What would our best personality traits be? What is the best gift we can share with others? What is the best thing I want to try? The possibilities for this text are huge!\n",
      "\n",
      "The last line of the poem on the last page of \"The Best Part of Me\" reads: \"These beautiful things are mine.\" This book reminds us to celebrate our students, celebrate each other, and celebrate ourselves. What is the best part of you?\n",

      "I enjoyed learning more about Susan Anthony, Margaret Sanger, and Betty Friedan in this well written and well documented book. We owe a huge thanks to them for tirelessly and bravely revolting against the thinking, attitudes, and laws of their day. Even more action is needed to bring full equality to women and to have fully equal partnerships with men, but we wouldn't be anywhere near as close to that today without their work. Their work should be included in every American History textbook.\n",

      "The book was a hard read, primarily because of the animosity and push back that these women had to deal with in order to give a voice to women and allow us to be seen. We are not second class. We are not property. We are not a means to an end (simply relegated as child bearers/carers). We are not a footnote in history.\n",
      "Do I agree with all of the approaches to get to where we are right now? No, but change is messy and I am thankful for those who forge the unpopular path to fight for our rights.\n",

      "An excellent overview of the history of three feminist icons and the times they impacted and lived in. While it’s certainly not super in-depth, in terms of both the women and the history, it provides a great basis that I realized I was lacking! It is engaging to read, though the final section is a bit ho-hum as it was written thirty years ago now. I found this book in the young adult section of the library and Archer is heralded as a non-fiction author for young people, but I would never have guessed that this book was intended for young audiences!\n",

      "The book, Break Point, is a historical romance set in the two years before the official start of WWII. The story follows the lives of two female amateur tennis players and the struggles they must face in this unsettled time. If you are a sports fan book will definitely appeal to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mieke von Bismark is the number one female tennis player in the world. She doesn’t need to turn pro, she is German royalty. She is a countess and a fierce competitor. Winning is her top priority on the court and nothing else matters more. Mieke’s life is altered when she becomes noticed by the furor, Adolf Hitler. In Hitler’s mind, her wins on the court, are a testament to her superior Aryan breeding. The problem for Mieke is that she is a lesbian in a time that that could land you in a concentration camp. The Nazi’s have spoken and she is forced to win in order to keep her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen Wheeler is other protagonist to this story. She is the number two female tennis player. She is on the precipice of turning pro, the only thing she needs to do is sign the contract. That is until Agent Lanier of the FBI shows up at her door. The FBI needs more information as to why a tennis player is meeting with Hitler. They force Helen into finding out why, using the past as their leverage. Helen and Meike used to be partners on the court and off.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought this book was a well written tale. I enjoyed to sports influence to a history romance novel. I thought both characters were interesting, and I enjoyed seeing their perspective of life in the late 1930’s. Sports based novels tend to give too much info on the game. Yolanda Wallace did a good job of not making the book too much about the actual sport, and its nuances. I will say the love story was good, but it didn’t ring my bell. If you had a strong past with a former lover, who suddenly broke up with you, I feel like the tension would be stronger. I just didn’t feel any true romance based emotions between these two characters. Overall, this a good quality read.\n",

      "\n",
      "The story took place in the 1930's just right before the brink of the second world war, and centers around the German top tennis player Meike and her top American contender Helen. Meike and Helen has known each other from the tennis circle and were briefly involved. Each left the relationship for a different reason and with a different perception despite how they feel about each other. Imagine reading rest of the story, when love, betrayal, war, patriotism and playing for your life all got throw into the mix - you get a book that you can't put down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading the book kind of reminds me of the 1936 Olympics and the histories and politics of it. For a book that writes about that period, I think this one has done a great job in portraying the fear of living under Nazism, while having characters you can still relate to. I absolutely loved Meike's courage and her loyalty to those she cared about. I had hoped to have more glimpse of Meike and Helen's life together, but I guess all in all, I'm still very happy with the ending. I'm going to put this book on my re-read shelf.\n",

      "Sports-themed lesfic is not my usual reading choice, mainly because I've always felt that sports action is much better watched than read. But this is book is set in pre-WWII Nazi Germany, a turbulent historical period that always lends itself to good storytelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen (American) and Meike (German) are amateur tennis players who meet regularly on and off court, in major tournaments around the world, and in bed. Meike's desire to concentrate on her singles career makes her dump Helen as both a doubles partner (for strategic reasons since Helen is a major rival) and lover. Meanwhile, Hitler wants to use Meike, who is physically a perfect model of the German aristocrat, for propaganda in furtherance of his dream of Aryan supremacy. Helen, on the other hand, sees herself being forcibly recruited by the US government to spy on Meike.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main characters, Helen and Meike are inspired by a couple of real tennis greats of that era, and the 'greatest tennis game ever' played. The author's attempt to fictionalize the characters and the events that transpired are moderately successful, though sometimes believability was stretched too thin for comfort. Those times, it felt like the author was trying to place the characters in certain situations in order to fit the narrative, but the set-ups were not always believable or logical. E.g.\n",

      "I was almost ready to write this off by the 60% mark but what totally saved it for me is the final third act, which saw some furious action and lots of drama on and off court. And of course, the greatest game ever played. In summary, totally get this if you're a lesfic fan who likes some intrigue, some danger, some loving, and some awesome tennis!\n",

The near constant anxiety as I worried endlessly for Meike's life was almost too intense. It was interesting to see Helen grow and so painful to see what Meike was put through but when they were together it was such a relief! In the end it all worked out the way it was suppose to but darn if Ms Wallace didn't make me work for it!\n",

      "Prometheus: The Art of the Film is a nice movie visual companion. A large landscape hardcover with 192 pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not the usual art book where you'll see lots of concept art. Rather, the content consist of film stills, photographs, storyboards and of course the concept art.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are more photos than concept art, not that it's bad thing. The photos are great actually, showing detailed look at the interiors of Prometheus, some of the sets built such as the Prometheus landing leg, the Pyramid, the head statue, the chamber with the Ampules, sculpted alien props and the landscape photos that were turned into alien environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept art featured are mainly the finalized versions. There aren't many variations for any particular design. For example, there's only one exterior design of Prometheus, a handful of designs for spacesuit, aliens, etc. That's perhaps the downside of this so called art book. I do like the concept art style and rendition which goes really well together with the photos to give the book a very singular unified look.\n",
      "\n",
      "The commentary talks about the important scenes and locations. Those are interesting as they explain the design. The book doesn't dissect the story so whatever you find ambiguous in the movie will still be more or less ambiguous after reading the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I consider this as more of a production design book. It's not an art book in the strictest sense as there aren't a lot of drawn art. However, I would still recommend it because it's packed with visuals all the way.\n",

      "To say I am a fan of Ridley Scott is like saying that I am a fan of breathing or being alive; it’s just sorta a given. As a filmmaker, he’s one of my idols; as a storyteller, he’s one of the masters. In short, the man can do almost no wrong in my eyes. So when the fine folks at Titan Books released PROMETHEUS: THE ART OF THE FILM, I knew it was going to be a must-have for me. And the book does not disappoint in the least. It is an excellent behind-the-scenes look at the concept art that inspired and helped shape Scott’s recent reentry into science-fiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve seen the film, then you already know how rife the imagery is with astute precision and detail. Scott is very meticulous with how his sets and props look, and this is always evident onscreen. This book takes you beyond the film, and shows you the detail that was put into every little piece of what you see in the movie.\n",
      "\n",
      "The photos in PROMETHEUS: THE ART OF THE FILM are breathtaking and the concept art is staggeringly good. It is always amazing to see how close the finished onscreen product can resemble the concept art, and this book gives you plenty of examples. From hand-drawn images to full-fleshed computer animation, there’s something for every science-fiction and/or art fan here.\n",
      "\n",
      "One aspect of the book that I thoroughly enjoy is the written descriptions of what each picture is and why it is important. We get to learn many things about the film, including the reasoning behind certain events and even the functionality of some of the set pieces. This gives an air of intrigue to several items that I completely missed when I watched the film itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book itself is a very nice hardback edition with large pages and beautiful graphics. Collector’s of film memorabilia will want to snatch this one up as soon as possible, as well fans of the film and just science-fiction fans in general. This book will make a welcome addition to your library and even be a great conversation-started on your coffee table. Give it a look today.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This book has been sitting on my to buy list for a while and then as is often the case an opportunity comes along for my to buy it and boy am I glad I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book is lavishly printed on high quality paper in landscape format with many of the images running over both pages - but unlike many books which use this format - the binding is strong enough for it to be opened out fully.\n",
      "The subject covers off all aspects of the film from location and vehicles to characters and aliens there is nothing the book does not however briefly touch upon. There are also enlightening comments about the process, the contributors and even the film making which all lends towards and openness and honesty about the coverage some books struggle or even completely lack.\n",
      "As a result this is a book I will go back to time and time again and enjoy reading all over again.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "An absolute must have for any fans. Whilst not going into too much detail on the making of the film, it gives a nice overview of the complete production, with stunning artwork from concept to completed sets. A great companion to the film.\n",

      "I bought this book because I hoped to find information about the log cabin at 2401 Laurel Canyon Boulevard, the house where Tom Mix apparently lived for a while and where, according to reports, he buried his horse, Tony, in the grounds. Alas, there was no such mention of the log cabin and scant entries for Tom Mix. Still, the book makes pleasant reading if you like stories about old Hollywood and has some wonderful photographs. I dip into it whenever I'm lounging in the living room and always find something new. It would make an excellent Christmas present for Hollywood buffs.\n",

      "Another YA series bites the dust...\n",
      "\n",
      "I was never too much into \"Blue Bloods\" series, but at least first two books were easy to read. This third one took a lot of effort to finish. It probably had a lot to do with the fact that the only thing I was attracted to in Cruz's books was the vampire lore. If in the beginning the lore seemed fresh and original to me, I am now fairly certain Cruz makes stuff up as she goes, without big picture of her world in mind, and this is why I am constantly confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are supposedly 400 Blue Bloods in the entire world, but some of them I understand were destroyed and consumed by Silver Bloods in Rome centuries ago, so how many are actually left? Enough to populate half of the Duchesne school (and those are only kids), have whole families of them in Texas, Italy, Japan, Brazil, NYC, etc., then there are Venators and their teams, Blue Bloods who refuse to reincarnate (like Lawrence) and lets don't forget, 90% of the models are Blue Bloods too. Where does it end? What are the limits of this world?\n",
      "\n",
      "The lore gets invented along the way just to explain some random events without ever being mentioned later on: apparently now vamps can morph into animals and even fog, but then why does Mimi have to follow her brother/bondmate in her black Bentley; vamps can cross states in minutes, then why do Schyler and Jack have their meetings in Manhattan where everybody knows them and they don't even bother to fog themselves up or something; vampires live on blood, but spend thousands of dollars on meals they apparently don't have any taste for; vampires can devour books within seconds and yet they fret over passing their school exams.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know, I must be nitpicking and there is some kind of convoluted explanation for each and every question of mine, but I guess I simply don't care about the books any more and not inspired to dig any deeper into the lore. There is only so much interest I can have for fallen angels whose aspirations in their immortal lives are limited to parties, pilates, cellulite treatments and modeling.\n",

      "I feel a little guilty rating this book only three stars - technically three and a half, rounded down to three.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've read every book in Alan Lewrie series. I've followed the man's life from his humble beginnings as a teenage ne'er-do-well who is basically press ganged into the Royal Navy during the American Revolution. I've grown to genuinely like the man, which is a huge compliment to the author. I was eager to read the next chapter in Lewrie's life. So why only three stars?\n",
      "\n",
      "The book feels transitional to me. Lewrie and the HMS Reliant begin the story in the Caribbean, return to London, jaunt down to Cape Town, and then wind up in Argentina. In each place Lewrie spends a little time, has some mild adventures, but nothing really critical happens to him in any given place. The highest drama takes place at the end - a naval battle with a Spanish Frigate off the coast of South America where he gets injured. But even that didn't really feel critical to the story. At the end of the story I felt like this book was a device for transitioning Alan from one place and move him back to Europe. I think the book needed a villain for Lewrie to struggle against. For example, his nemesis, Choundas, from the earlier stories. Choundas is dead now, but maybe Alan needs a new foe?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line, if you've read the earlier books, you will enjoy this one. I did. But in terms of a stand alone story, Hostile Shores was weaker than some of the other Lewrie stories.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Good ol' reliable Dewey and his alter-ego Alan! A \"rollicking good read\" as they like to say. Alan is definitely maturing; his ram-catting is more notional, now, than before; it's his First Mate who does the dirty every chance he gets. Spoiler: We lose a beloved cat in this book. The author's regard for, and understanding of, felines, is notable, and, to this reader, endearing.\n",
      "I very much appreciate history-telling in this manner, populated with \"acquaintances\" but absolutely plotted around real events and, to a good extent, actual historical figures. This makes the history much more memorable to me. In this book we have bits of South American history I don't think I ever heard: the Brits trying to acquire their own colony, and failing.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "From success to failure!\n",
      "\n",
      "In this further tale of Alan Lewrie's we find him invoked in the successful retaking of the Cape and the father more unsuccessful taking of part of Argentina. The tale has some romance and lots more blood and thunder, with Lewrie's at some odds with his Commodore, Home Popham, who is definitely a glory Hunter and at the end our hero is left with a serious perhaps career ending wound. A very good tale and we'll worth five stars\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",

      "An interesting sequel, with many elements and the style that characterize Hitchikers #1, possibly the funniest book I’ve ever read. Many funny moments and absurd genialities of a tragically comic universe like only Douglas can deliver. Unfortunately, for various reasons, this sequel didn’t really cut it. Maybe the surprise was lost, maybe the humor didn’t nail it like the first time. Maybe the first book set a too high standard, impossible to reach.\n",

      "So much in such a short work\n",
      "Including time manipulation, end of time, relativity of death and afterlife, monetarization of the end of the universe, human evolution and what may have influenced it, madness resulting from the insight of humankinds´ unimportance concerning the cosmic scale, etc., Adams covers a large range of topics in a small number of pages and mixes it with fabulous character description, dialogues, and weird protagonist premises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Searching for the hidden meanings\n",
      "Dissecting satire is no fun, but a difficult and highly subjective endeavor and it seems to me as if Adams has packed even more innuendos about grievances into it than in the first, more light-hearted part of his legendary series. Not dark, but a bit more in the grey area, typical growing a beard style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe the best part\n",
      "It´s very difficult to choose the best part of the series, but I would prefer this one because it needs no further explanation and goes directly into different plots and the epic ending gives deep insights into human cultural evolution and lets one ask the question whose weirdo descendants we might be.\n",

      "The universe is a joke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even before I was shown the meaning of life in a dream at 17 (then promptly forgot it because I thought I smelled pancakes), I knew this to be true--and yet, I have always felt a need to search for the truth, that nebulous, ill-treated creature. Adams has always been, to me, to be a welcome companion in that journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between the search for meaning and the recognition that it's all a joke in poor taste lies Douglas Adams, and, luckily for us, he doesn't seem to mind if you lie there with him. He's a tall guy, but he'll make room.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all his crazed unpredictability, Adams is a powerful rationalist. His humor comes from his attempts to really think through all the things we take for granted. It turns out it takes little more than a moment's questioning to burst our preconceptions at the seams, yet rarely does this stop us from treating the most ludicrous things as if they were perfectly reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is no surprise that famed atheist Richard Dawkins found a friend and ally in Adams. What is surprising is that people often fail to see the rather consistent and reasonable philosophy laid out by Adams' quips and absurdities. His approach is much more personable (and less embittered) than Dawkins', which is why I think of Adams as a better face for rational materialism (which is a polite was of saying 'atheism').\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading his books, it's not hard to see that Dawkins is tired of arguing with uninformed idiots who can't even recognize when a point has actually been made. Adams' humanism, however, stretched much further than the contention between those who believe, and those who don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "We see it from his protagonists, who are not elitist intellectuals--they're not even especially bright--but damn it, they're trying. By showing a universe that makes no sense and having his characters constantly question it, Adams is subtly hinting that this is the natural human state, and the fact that we laugh and sympathize shows that it must be true.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's all a joke, it's all ridiculous. The absurdists might find this depressing, but they're just a bunch of narcissists, anyhow. Demnading the world make sense and give you purpose is rather self centered when it already contains toasted paninis, attractive people in bathing suits, and Euler's Identity. I say let's sit down at the bar with the rabbi, the priest, and the frog and try to get a song going. Or at least recognize that it's okay to laugh at ourselves now and again. It's not the end of the world.\n",

      "This book will be lapped up by those who caught this sit-com either first time around on BBC TV; or the later repeats on “Yesterday”. Long may those repeats continue! Roy Clarke’s witty scripts were pretty flawless. He tapped into a very good-natured British humour that laughed together with the characters; so very different to many of today’s writers whose sense of so-called ‘humour’ sadly seeks to reduce, embarrass, humiliate and isolate by applying the scourge of political correctness.\n",

It was the ultimate “What If” sitcom. The whole family sat together, laughing and hooting with mirth.\n",

      "Though I knew that had been a remarkably long-lived comedy; I hadn’t realised that mean’t a whopping 295 thirty-minute episodes over the course of 37 years between 1973 and 2010 (for more information see ).\n",
      "\n",
      "So Andrew Vine’s book came to me as a wonderful opportunity not only to relive past pleasures in watching this superb situational comedy, but to also discover and learn more about the team and talents that came together to script and to make this very imaginative and creative off the wall show; and how success breeds problems which need solutions; the most obvious of which was the entirely natural process of the natural ageing and natural death of many of its actors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vine makes no mention of just how profitable , was (or continues to be) to the BBC and to the residents of Holmfirth; but for a show that at Christmas 1981 garnered seventeen million viewers; compared to the fourteen million for the much hyped TV premiere of , the wine must have indeed been sweet. I remember being on a (church)-bellringing outing many years ago, in and around Holmfirth, the Yorkshire town in which much of the filming took place. Sid and Ivy’s café was located near the church. As we pulled the bells off (their stays) for a course of Cambridge Surprise Major, I half expected Ivy to race over to give us a right telling off; bad for business … putting customers off their tea …!\n",
      "\n",
      "To write a detailed book about such an incredibly successful British national institution which crossed all class boundaries, as was and did; must have been as a daunting prospect; however Andrew Vine has firmly grasped the challenge and has achieved an excellent result; one that will delight both the ‘anoraks’ and those readers who are familiar with this sitcom. To the show’s fans, aspiring TV screenwriters or directors, this book will be invaluable. To all others, this book may prove bafflingly culturally unintelligible unless and until watched on-screen. Don’t miss it!\n",

      "OK, so I admit it - I have never really been \"on trend\". When my sister was pogo-ing to Hong Kong Gardens by Souxsie and the Banshees and kick-dancing to Into The Valley by the Skids, I was upstairs in my bedroom, singing along to the jazz-styled harmonies of Manhattan Transfer. While everyone I know has a smart-phone of some description, mine doesn't even have a camera, (although when I had my dog, I found it has a very handy torch built in to the end - just the right thickness to hold in my hand with his lead, as my other was occupied with a walking stick!) And now I have another terrible secret... I actually ! Right up to the end, it never failed to give me at least one or two laugh out loud moments every episode; although there was a short period, after Bill Owen's death, when they dragged his son, (whose acting abilities made Dev look like an Oscar contender,) in with some sub-Spit-the-dog puppet, where I lost faith a little and stopped watching until it picked up again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time Howard said to Marina, \"I think we've cracked it this time,\" I knew I was in for a laugh. The choreographed coffee-drinking of the ladies and Thora Hird’s admonishments to Glenda to “Drink your coffee!” every time some tame and innocent double entendre about Barry’s bedroom prowess cropped up made me chuckle many times I saw them. So, for me, this book was perfection to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Full of lines from the series, (obviously some of the best ones, but what great lines!) reminiscences from cast members and background stories of who got along with who and who didn’t, as well as plenty of background detail as to how the series came about and developed behind the scenes, it was a joy from start to finish. And the later chapters, detailing the death of Bill Owen and the subsequent deaths of other, well-loved cast members, literally had me in tears. It was also interesting to read how it was due to be scrapped earlier, but due to Brand-gate and allegations of ageism, it was reprieved for a final couple of series and it was good to be reminded just what a popular programme it was in its heyday. One year, the BBC had spent a fortune on obtaining the rights to screen at Christmas and another fortune trailing it as that year’s big Christmas event. The viewing figures for the Christmas special those of the epic film! Although I miss the laughs it gave me, I think it went at the right time. Frank Thornton is now dead and the programme couldn’t risk the demise of Peter Sallis – a programme predicated on one last great hurrah wouldn’t have been able to withstand that final reminder of our collective mortality!\n",
      "\n",
      "However, one amusing theme throughout the book made me take a note to myself – however famous you might become, (hardly likely,) write an autobiography. It doesn’t matter how nice a person you think that you are, there will always be someone to pop up to say, “He wasn’t like ; he was a !” With possibly the exception of Kathy Staff, quotes from various cast members autobiographies, making out how lovely they were, were trashed by other cast members. (Kathy, it seems, was the exception, loved by all – heartening to read for those of us who loved her both as the formidable Nora Batty and Miss Luke from .)\n",
      "\n",
      "If you weren’t a fan of the programme, (why not?) then clearly don’t bother with this book. In fact, you won’t even be reading this review, why would you? But if, like me, you laughed contentedly, every time Thora Hird shouted, “Wes-lay!” and only just made it with a sheet of newspaper between his oily hand and the doorframe, then this book will be essential reading and a joy from start to finish!\n",

      "I admit I have not been a fan of the show, but my husband is, and I have sat through many episodes and their endless repeats on Sky TV. I found this book absorbing to read, telling the story of what inspired the comedy, its location, the casting, the skill of the script writing, and the production itself - what worked and what didn't, all interspersed with lines from the script. The author is not afraid to give an opinion on the actor foibles - Bill Owen seeing himself as the show's star, Brian Wilde tricky to work with in his initial series, Michael Aldridge, a kind, team player, Thora Hird, always wanting to talk - but these criticisms written in a gentle manner. The illnesses and deaths of key characters hit the long serving production team hard and are movingly told. Some chapters are wordy and I did skim through them, but overall I found this an impressive, rounded account of one of the nation's favourite situation comedies. It was truly an inside story, and made me more sympathetic towards the show.\n",

      "What a great tribute to a joyous comedy. A great insight into the making of Last of the Summer Wine. This tells about the foibles, clashes of personalities and friendships behind the scenes of this long lasting comedy series. Well crafted and easy to read, it is a refreshing piece of nostalgia for me. Long live Compo, Cleggy & Foggy, plus all the others who made the show so memorable, so many who are no longer with us!\n",

      "A gem of pop math exposition, harking back to the days when the notion of a broadly literate lay readership was taken seriously (I guess it still is, but more narrowly). I can understand why this one has been published and republished in successive editions. Reid, though not a mathematician herself, is a terrific expositor. She has an eye for the interesting detail and a gift for explaining it. For the budding young mathematician, this book's a delight. For anyone who thinks math's a bore, I challenge them not to find something at which to marvel in it.\n",

      "Ik had een editie van 1965. Het taalgebruik doet archaïsch aan, maar het stoort niet, integendeel, zeker in de passage waar beschreven wordt hoe een wiskundige die een jaar van zijn leven besteedde om uit te vissen of een bepaald getal een priemgetal was of niet, aanwezig was toen een 'elektronische rekenmachine' dit vraagstuk op een minuutje oploste, lijkt het alsof je terug geworpen wordt in de tijd. Verder kwam ik een passage tegen waarin verteld wordt hoe Euler een voortbrengende functie vond om te bepalen op hoeveel manieren een getal geschreven kan worden als de som van natuurlijke getallen: een vraagstuk dat in de lijst van voorkomt, waarop ik mijn tanden stuk beet. Een vlot geschreven boekje dat ik aan iedereen die een beetje interesse in wiskunde heeft, kan aanbevelen.\n",

      "This is an interesting little book. The content at the beginning is a little simplistic and I was worried that nothing in the book would be challenging or new to me. However, as the chapters progress the mathematics discussed gets more complex and more interesting. And the final chapter on infinity is excellent.\n",
      "One complaint I have about the book is that the organization is strange. The book is organized by chapters on each digit starting 0, 1, 2, etc. before ending with e and infinity (aleph sub zero). However, each chapter is not really about the digit. The chapter on '2' is actually about binary, '3' is about primes, '6' is about Mersenne numbers, '7' Fermat numbers, '9' congruence (modular arithmetic), etc.\n",

      "Wilson and co-author Hill present a breezy overview of conspiracy thinking that is concise and entertaining even if it is not comprehensive. A novice to the world of conspiracy, I enjoyed starting with an entry and following the cross-references around the book. The JFK assassination, UFOs, organized religion, the Council on Foreign Relations, the plan to genetically engineer a flying elephant--it's all here. Even if you, like me, believe that conspiracy enthusiasts are out to lunch, you may find something here to give you pause. For me, it was the suspicious information regarding the US currency and Constitution.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This book is an encyclopedia, and if you don't like reading encyclopedias you won't like it. In the Age of Wikipedia, EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL can seem a bit quaint. It's also a bit dated; 20 years old now, Wilson's book spends a bit too much time talking about conspiracy theories which were very much on our collective minds in the 90s, but which don't make a whole lot of press or sense now. The most obvious example of this is repressed memory therapy, which Wilson clearly finds not just laughable but outright dangerous, traumatizing as it does individuals and their families. There are multiple entries in various facets of this practice, as well as AIDS conspiracies that are not even remotely plausible today, when we have made so much amazing progress (at least in the US) treating the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that said, Wilson is still a cultural treasure and even something as seemingly dry as an encyclopedia is actually quite funny, thanks to his voice. EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL also does the two things encyclopedias are best at doing: educating, and prompting one's curiosity. I read it with my web browser handy so I could look up the people and places he name-drops, just to get a 2016 update on them. And I have many notes; elements of this book which will get worked into other projects of my own.\n",

      "For someone who has literally grown up on tomes of encyclopaedias, this was reminder of all the moments spent on a lazy afternoon on a balcony, trying to decipher the various questions buzzing in my head. On to the book, this was my first Robert Anton Wilson book and I was surprised to see the utter wit and sass that had been incorporated into the writing, making it not only an informative but an enjoyable read too. If you are looking for a Wikipedia kind of a book, with lengthy details, this book isn't for you. Written in a true encyclopaedia format, the topics are organised alphabetically and proper references given as footnotes for further, detailed study. I had to read this one slowly, to understand so many things casually mentioned which made it feel like a research project on its own! Hauling more books by the author soon!\n",

      "\"Just below the grim tranquillity Mellas had learned to display, he cursed with boiling intensity the ambitious men who used him and his troops to further their careers. He cursed the air wing for not trying to get any choppers in through the clouds. He cursed the diplomats arguing about round and square tables. He cursed the South Vietnamese making money off the black market. He cursed the people back home gorging themselves in front of their televisions. Then he cursed God. Then there was no one else to blame and he cursed himself for thinking God would give a shit\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2nd Lieutenant Mellas, an Ivy League graduate, finds himself in Vietnam commanding a platoon. The officers have been thinned out so severely that the Company Commander is a 1st Lieutenant and the Executive Officer is a 2nd Lieutenant. Both positions are normally held by much more senior officers. He has Corporals that have survived a couple of tours in the jungle and at the tender age of 19 are now crusty veterans. He is 22 and being asked to fight a war with babies in fatigues. He worships bush Marines decked out with non-regulation mustaches, dreadlocks, and boots so scuffed they are white. His head is spinning with desires for medals and proving his courage under fire. He is beset by doubts about his abilities, and yet wants to do more than just survive. He wants to be successful.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As the chapters flip by we really get to see Mellas evolve as a person. As he sheds his state side training and becomes a real marine leader I actually started to like him. More important his men started to respect him. As he experiences more combat and loses men he starts to understand the politics of the war. That change from being concerned about his own future to understanding the futility of the circumstances in Vietnam is a shattering experience for him. Colonel Mulvaney his Regimental Commander expresses his own jaded views about the war.\n",

      "The cynicism was certainly understandable when success is measured in body counts, blood trails, and probable kills.

      "The tension between the splibs (black combatants) and the chucks (white combatants)usually became a bigger issue during down times between combat missions. Marlantes, I felt, told both sides of the race issue with an even hand. He even took us into the decision making sessions of the officers further up the chain, giving the reader a view of the pressures they were receiving and the unorthodox ways they were forced to measure success. Objectives were not clear even higher up the chain of command. The pain, the misery, the waste that are endemic in all wars was even harder to withstand in Vietnam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helicopters were the life blood of this war and when they couldn't fly for several days food, water, and ammunition became scarce and boys were left to die. It was hard at times for me to read about the circumstances and the unrealistic expectations we had for combat troops in Vietnam coupled with the haphazard supply lines we had in place to give them the basics of what they needed to even do their job. At one point in time the troops go eight days without food and are expected to withstand an enemy assault.\n",

They were not treated with the honor and the dignity befitting warriors returning from a war that many worked very hard to avoid and were frankly smart to do so. The combat soldiers in Vietnam could not win the war. They could not win battles like the Battle of Normandy or the Battle of the Bulge. They did not return to America knowing that they made the world a safer place. They took the same risks as the soldiers of world war two with so much less to be gained.\n",

He was awarded the Navy Cross, the Bronze Star, two Navy Commendation Medals for valor, two Purple Hearts, and ten air medals, so he wasn't in the rear somewhere as part of the supply train. I feel like I know much, much more about the Vietnam war than what I have gleaned from other novels or histories. Marlantes takes you into the elephant grass, with leeches hanging from your legs, and jungle rot oozing pus from the cuts on your hands. If you didn't question our objectives in Vietnam and more recently our objectives in Afghanistan and Iraq you will after reading this book. We have to know that when we are sacrificing our kids that it is for the right reasons. They are not and never should be just numbers on a board. Highly Recommended!\n",

      "Grim. Heartbreaking. There were sections of this book that, honest to God, were difficult to read. If you cannot read war novels, don’t even pick it up. If you are made uncomfortable by vivid descriptions of suffering and of overwhelming human endurance, do not read this book. If out of touch and passionless bureaucratic polices that result in needless hurt anger you, then stay far away. If brilliantly illustrated characterizations of incompetent, careerist, wannabe politician, couldn’t-lead-a-trip-to-the-zoo overpaid and over privileged senior governmental “leaders” makes you want to drop off the grid and go live in a cabin in the woods – well, you get the point. This book inspires strong emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "With imagery that reminds me of the writing of Peter Matthiessen, and with brutally honest and realistically complex characterizations that would make Jonathan Franzen proud, author Karl Marlantes has crafted a fictional novel that breathes with life and that tells the good, the bad, and the ugly of a difficult time. Transcending simply a war novel about Vietnam, Marlantes lucidly describes how the military, and the war itself, shaped our society. Matterhorn deals with race relations, class distinctions and the relationship a citizen has with his government in a stirring, but painfully sublime morality play that realistically communicates a time and place but, more than that, paints a striking, and often uncomplimentary, portrait of who we are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Himself a decorated Vietnam veteran Marine, Marlantes has also illustrated a description of his service that, though it objectively deals with the governmental and bureaucratic failings of the Corps, also offers a glimpse into what it means to be semper fidelis; though he states succinctly that a true understanding is unattainable for the rest of us. I have an uncle who served two tours of duty in Vietnam as a Marine, very proud of him, and I have more than once been impressed by the Marines.\n",

      "It is unlikely that indentured slaves were worked as hard as grunt Marines in Vietnam. Certainly not with as little to show for it. The sociology that kept these men from escaping entirely through drugs or killing their officer-oppressors is complex - a mix of fear of authority, comradeship, exhausted inertia and the vague hope that their suffering might end without death. Patriotism, revenge, and military pride didn’t register on the meter of soldierly motivations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Officers, that class of person whom the military suspects might be human, are ambitious prats. The young ones want medals; the older ones want rank and larger commands. Few of them have much regard for the lives of those who report to them. Their main concerns are recognition and reputation. As in most corporate hierarchies, they progress proportionately to their political skill not their competence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within the permanent class warfare between officers and enlisted in ‘The Corps,’ other intense battles are waged continuously - between the whites and the blacks, staff and line, liberals and racists, new boys and old hands, short-timers and those who dare not count the days left, lifers and draftees, malingerers and hard men, the weak and the strong, the literate and the unschooled. Occasional shooting and fear eases the tensions but never resolves them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The politics among officers is simpler: Be noticed; never contradict a superior; have faith in the language of command. This latter includes the idolatry of maps, situation reports, body counts, radio protocols, intelligence estimates, and plans of attack and defence. An officer’s world is entirely symbolic as soon as he is given any unit command whatsoever. This is what he is trained for. Reality is only known by the grunts and no one asks them about it. Unfortunately only they know that the map is not the territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the important innovations of the Vietnamese War was so-called air mobility, the capacity to move large numbers of fighters quickly to remote places. What the military failed to understand at the time was that it was easier to move the men than to keep them supplied with the essentials of life (and for that matter, death). Despite the rather well-stocked commissaries for those in the rear, front-line troops literally starved when they couldn’t be supplied by air... or were just forgotten about. The language of intimidatory command doesn’t work on technology and other objects like it does on human beings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The involvement of the United States in Vietnam was a military and moral tragedy. But not primarily because of defeat and the atrocities committed routinely by American soldiers. The tragedy already existed in the military and its ethos before VietNam. And it continues to exist today. This ethos is one of exploitation of the young by the old. The old sacrifice the young for the sake of symbols and through symbols that mask personal interests. Everything else is collateral damage. This is the essence of military life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dead and wounded are, therefore, only one consequence of this sacrificial ethos. Those, like the Marines in Matterhorn, who are exposed to its full force never recover. And it is passed on like a virulent virus from generation to generation. Their memory of suffering produces yet more symbology for which to sacrifice yet more young people. Matterhorn is a chronicle of how symbols not bullets are used to dominate and destroy human beings.\n",

      "Newly Tarted Up Review! I...well...honestly, I have no idea what word to use to describe how I feel about MATTERHORN by Karl Marlantes﻿. It's a superlative book, no adjectives need apply. I gave it five stars because that's the scale...but it deserves six.\n",

      "Today I’ll be reviewing Matterhorn, a novel about the Vietnam war. Play your favorite classic rock song of the era while reading. Buffalo Springfield’s For What’s It’s Worth is always a popular choice. You could use Credence Clearwater’s Fortunate Son. For myself, I'll be listening to The End from The Doors and then plan on going into a full-on Martin Sheen-Apocalypse Now-freak-out as I lay on a bed staring up at the ceiling fan in a pair of tidy whiteys until I drink enough to punch out a mirror and then break down crying.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll admit that I didn’t really think there were any more stories to tell about Vietnam that I hadn‘t heard. As a teenager in the ‘80s when every male action hero from Thomas Magnum to Sonny Crockett was supposedly a ‘Nam vet, and movies like and were coming out regularly, I just didn’t think there was a scenario that someone could come up with that hadn’t been done to death. Plus, I used to have a neighbor who was a Vietnam vet who would tell me some hair-raising stories when he got a few beers in him that had the ring of authenticity that even grittiest fictional stories can’t convey.\n",
      "\n",
      "But had a lot of good buzz about it so I finally picked it up. I got worried in the first chapter where there‘s a lot concerning leeches in the jungle. There wasn’t anything there that I hadn’t seen on film or read dozens of time before. Until one of the Marines discover that a leech crawled inside his penis. That’s when I realized that Karl Marlantes may be doing a story in a familiar setting, but he had the knowledge and ability to make it horrible and fresh all over again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marlantes is a decorated Marine Vietnam veteran with a chest full of medals. He spent 30 years (30 years!) writing this story off and on before finally getting it published. The story centers on a company of Marines circa 1969 with a young and ambitious lieutenant named Mellas taking over a rifle platoon in Bravo Company as soon as he arrives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mellas may be inexperienced, but he could turn into a good officer. He’s got skills with maps and a feel for terrain and tactics, but his political instincts may keep him from being an effective combat leader. Mellas and the Marines are trying to fortify a mountaintop position called Matterhorn and patrol the surrounding thick jungle. Between jungle illnesses and always being exhausted from the patrols, night watches and the hard labor of establishing the camp, the Marines are stretched thin. Racial tensions in the company aren’t helping anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "But things get much worse when drunken battalion commander Simpson and his manipulative operations officer Blakely decide to use Bravo to try and locate NVA forces they’re sure are in the area of Matterhorn. Simpson sends Bravo out on long jungle recons when they’re dangerously under-supplied and exhausted and when bad weather prevents helicopters from reaching them. When Bravo can’t meet his aggressive timetable, Simpson simply demands more of them and labels them as whining malcontents, and eventually Marines start dying because of the orders that Simpson is issuing.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s been a long time since I’ve read anything that infuriated and angered me as much as Simpson and Blakely’s treatment of Bravo Company. I spent most of this book hoping that some of the Marines will make good on their threat to frag the two asshole officers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marlantes’s 30 years work on this really paid off. While Vietnam stories may have become somewhat clichéd, he’s managed to craft a story that transcends all the slang and trivia we’ve become acquainted with. His Mellas character is probably a bit of a Mary Sue, but considering Marlantes’s background and time spent on this novel, it didn’t bother me a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint is that some of the parts concerning the racial tensions do seem hokey in places. There’s one part where Mellas has a conversation with one of his black Marines, and it comes across as earnestly sincere as one of those old After School Specials. Only with guns and saying, “fuck’ a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, this is a terrific war novel that’ll tear your heart out as it teaches you something new about Vietnam. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to do some drinking and stare at my ceiling fan.\n",

This book allowed me to experience what might have been. Kevin, the central character, is a keen observer of human nature, at times wise beyond his years—when not allowing his stomach to churn! It ended rather abruptly for me, but still felt like a full summer of growth, without my actually enduring Spooks Shoulder or the bullying that occurs before a young man stands tall. Give it a read.

      "I came across this when looking for (and failing to find) books about the WNBA written for adults. Even though this book is written for younger readers, I learned a lot about the evolution of women's basketball. It came out in 2003, so obviously doesn't have tons of WNBA stuff. Reading about the large crowds and ample broadcast media coverage of various amateur and professional women's leagues of the past, it brought new perspectives to the depressing state of coverage in the current media environment.\n",

I'm guessing she thought of these two like pandas when they try to get them to mate at the zoo. They are basically sex-less creatures. Not interested, and that works out great for us because we don't want pandas to be a bunch of Pepe LePews. It would be gross and totally spoil our image of pandas. These book characters have sex.

      "I'm rating this book 4.5 stars. When I originally looked into reading this I was weary about the mail order bride concept. But it turns out it wasn't an issue at all. In fact it was pretty absent throughout the book. I almost loved this read. I had no issues with this book at all. Which is a rarity for me. The only thing I would change is I think the relationship between Hugh and Deleny could have used some intensity and better kiss scenes, extra. One of my favourite concepts in this read was definitely the town. The author executed it perfectly. And I loved how all supernaturals lived there and not just vampires. I loved how humans weren't put down in this book also. When you read many books where there's a human with a supernatural race like a vamp or werewolves. It's common for the humans in the book to be looked down upon as the weakist race. And or stupid. I really liked Delenys character. Especially her love of baking and outspokenness. The supporting characters were perfect. I look forward to reading about their stories in the future. One thing I loved was that the author didn't wait out all the issues that were in the plot and with the characters. An example would be the mafia issue was taken care of quickly and not overly drawn out. I also liked how the book focused more on their relationship then anything else. Overall I loved reading this and will definitely continue this series. I will warn other people thinking of reading this that if your not into paranormal/fantasy this is not for you.\n",

      "I have been on a REALLY bad streak of vampire books this month. I thought this one would be light, fun, and inoffensive. And it did start off well, as some other reviews mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just a couple chapters in I ran into a problem, but I decided to keep going. And then there was another problem, and another. And I decided I'd had enough because I have so many other things to read and sometimes I just don't want to deal with vampire portrayals I don't like.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, each of the three problems I mentioned above is really all one: the ex-girlfriend of this book's hero. Her name is Piper. The H and h (Hugh and Delaney) run into her in town one day and she's immediately a bitch. It's clear she's bitter about the breakup of her five-month relationship with Hugh, and it's even implied she's drunk. Delaney looks like a total, levelheaded saint next to her (naturally).\n",
      "\n",
      "The next time we see Piper, it's at a pub where Hugh and Delaney are going to have dinner. They all run into each other and the bar and Piper is a bitch who sloshes her drink around (again, being a future alcoholic is implied), telling Delaney that Hugh WILL break up with her, yadda yadda, Delaney has witty, calm comebacks and Hugh thinks she's awesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Hugh and Delaney leave the pub to have pizza that's somehow shockingly good despite not being made in New York (GASP!!!), they go back home only to find Piper is there. Piper has done some sleuthy Googling and found out that Delaney is not who she's been saying she is. She causes a scene and is shown out.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now Delaney has to explain herself to Hugh, who's understandably angry that a stranger has taken up residence in his house. She had witnessed her mobster boss murder someone, so she ran and ended up in a matchmaking agency. She stole the file of a woman who'd been matched, called the woman and explained that the match had been cancelled, then traveled to take the woman's place, all so her boss wouldn't be able to find her and kill her.\n",
      "\n",
      "And how does Hugh react? He's perfectly understanding! Because this was totally normal-person behavior. Piper is psychotic, Delaney is an innocent victim who cons her way into a stranger's home for a perfectly good reason!\n",
      "\n",
      "This double standard way of reacting to the non-normal behavior of different women made me decide to put this one down. I don't like when women are pitted against each other in fiction just so one can be held up and the other torn down. I don't care if it happens in real life. I don't care that some exes are evil and bitter. I'm tired of this portrayal of them. This only further reinforces how girls are taught to act and not to act in order to attract or repel the attention of men. I hate it and I'm asserting my right to refuse to read about it.\n",

      "\n",
      "Gage has been my favorite character in the trilogy since the first book. He was the loner in the group, even though his friendship with Cal and Fox was strong and undeniable. He was the one with the tortured past and the harsh demeanor. He was impatient and sometimes rude, but I never felt that he was out of line. My feelings often mirrored his while I was reading the book, and he alone got my eyes misty 3 times. Yup, one could say I felt a very strong connection with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked Cybil too. Out of the three heroines in the trilogy, she's my favorite, but that isn't saying much because I didn't really like Quinn () and Layla (). Cybil was good for Gage and, , completed him and made him a better man. The reversal was also true, and that's why their romance worked for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the war against the Big Evil, it was thrilling and scary, just like it was supposed to be. I was almost bored to tears with all the talking in the previous book and, to be fair, there's also a lot of talking about the demon in this book, but I found it more interesting this time. Probably because everything the \"gang\" (Cal & Quinn, Fox & Layla, and Gage & Cybil) did seemed to be more urgent and to the point, as I knew the end was coming. There were a couple of things that triggered some eye-rolling on my part, but this is a PNR novel and you have to take a leap of faith sometimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this was a great ending to an uneven trilogy. was really good and got me hooked on it, but was just average and slightly disappointing. I was glad to see getting the trilogy back on track and ending it on a high note.\n",

      "I'm sorry, I was just bored by this book. Research, research, research interspersed with predictable demon attacks. I didn't really feel a connection to the characters and I started to skim a lot of the book. As is often the case, especially with the last two trilogies, after a two and a half book buildup, the ending was anticlimactic. I still think Three Sisters Island was her best trilogy with a supernatural thread and I kind of feel like the trilogies in general need a reboot--they don't feel fresh anymore.\n",

      "I soooo wanted to say a perfect ending to the trilogy, but I can’t. I was so looking forward to reading this one, to giving it a 5-star rating, like I do with most of NR’s novels, but I can’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continue the Sign of Seven trilogy, this time with Gage and Cybil’s story. While it’s obvious to the reader that these two will end up together (every love story has to have an HEA), it was over-stated! Every time there was a conversation between them about them, it started with ‘not happening’ to ’sure but no strings attached’. There was doubt, then there was ‘could this work’, moving on to ‘I don’t do roots’. Okay, we got it already. Please move on to the story. While I did like how they fell in love, it was downplayed by all that talking and wondering and supposing. And I don’t usually say that about NR’s work. To say converstaion was over-stated, has to be a first. It actually made me think of the movie The Bachelor - not wanting to settle down.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked how they still hadn’t quite figured out how to kill the demon, how they were still researching every lead, every clue, every possibility, how Cybil didn’t want to quit with searching for an answer, even when those answers didn’t turn to the positive side. Although one scenerio was a bit of a stretch - combining Gage’s blood with the town’s water supply? I’d think that the blood would be way to diluted to actually make a difference. I don’t even think that should have been in the story as it was rather ridiculous, even for a suggestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did like learning more about their pasts, but it could have used more development. I found there wasn’t enough to understand why Cybil is the way she is now. You learn what happened with her father, but it still wasn’t enough to understand Cybil. I did like the conversations as they discussed what to do and how. While all three women turning up pregnant was sort of cliched, I liked each separate reaction. I liked how they figured out the last of it, how Cybil interprets a dream/vision on the fly. Another cliche is how they sometimes had the same nightmare/dream; while a cliche, I thought it worked well with the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens between Gage and his father, and what happens to his father, was an unexpected surprise. But there is one part in this story that, while I was expecting it, I wasn’t expecting it happen that quick. When Gage reveals to Cybil a fake bloodstone that he bought, they decided a plan of action, to see if they could fool the demon, and to make it as believable as possible. While I was expecting what came next, I wasn’t expecting it to happen right on the next chapter. The fights/arguments that insued was totally believable; my heart started to pound and my hands were shaking, I had to put the book down when I found out it was the fake action they’d planned to use against the demon. She had written it so believable she had me fooled. Me? Yeah, me, LOL! And when a writer does that to me, they have a fan for life.

      "==============\n",
      "The story of the Hollywood studio system, its life from the 1920s until the studios died /changed around 1960. A great deal of focus on David Selznick and Alfred Hitchcock. Fascinating through and through. I liked reading about how movies dealt with television (by selling their catalogues to TV networks, among other things).\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The Genius of the System isn’t quite a history of Hollywood during the golden age. As the author admits, to have tried to tackle the history of all the studios in this period would have been beyond the resources of a single writer and would have made for an inordinately long book. Instead author Thomas Schatz concentrates his attention on two major studios, one minor studio and one independent producer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two major studios Schataz chooses are MGM and Warner Brothers, his third subject is one of the “major minors,” in this case Universal, and the independent producer David O. Selznick.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great strength of this book is that the author does not set out with a preconceived idea that the studio system was repressive or morally dubious, or that studio executives like Louis B. Mayer, Jack Warner or Darryl F. Zanuck were monsters. As his book makes clear, Hollywood in its golden age made great movies as a result of a fruitful partnership between enlightened but practical studio executives, visionary producers and talented directors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book’s other great strength is that Schatz largely ignores the auteur theory, the theory that there is only one true creative force behind any movie and that force is the director. He argues, very convincingly, that producers had at least as much impact on the finished product as directors and that those directors who are usually singled out for auteur status were those directors who were able to combine the roles of director and producer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great strength of the studio system is that it created an environment in which creativity could blossom and in which a unique balance was achieved between business and art. Even those mavericks who operated largely outside the studio system needed the support that the studio system provided. The creative personnel who bucked the system, people like Alfred Hitchcock and David O. Selznick, flourished during the great days of the studio system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The studio system represented a unique partnership between capitalism and art, and it worked. When it was destroyed, by a combination of television and excessively zealous government intervention in the marketplace, the result was a cultural tragedy of epic proportions. A unique balance has been achieved and once that balance was disrupted Hollywood started on a downward slide that has continued to this day.\n",
      "\n",
      "is one of the finest books ever written about Hollywood and is highly recommended to anyone who loves movies.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I thought I knew how the studio system worked before reading this book, but I came away realizing that the system was just a generic term for having exclusive rights to talent and big pieces of real estate in which to make and show movies. The overhead to run big studios was enormous so the trick was to keep everyone busy making product while balancing quality and cost. Irving Thalberg had a production approach that was perfect for the Studio system. MGM could not duplicate it without him and by the late 40s it was obsolete anyway. Those Thalberg years were productive for MGM at a time when no other studio made money on their pictures. Maybe Warners and Paramount made enough money in their theaters to offset the production losses. I was never quite sure of Schatz’s accounting methods. But all of this was contrary to how movies have been described as depression proof due to people needing an escape from poverty. Universal, for instance, made good money with their horror output but then blew the money on prestige films that never had a chance of making a profit. Warners made great earning gangster pictures and then Cagney and Robinson would moan about better roles in pictures that would lose money.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there was any lesson of the studio era it’s that prestige pictures were money losers and b-movies and serials were cash cows. Most of MGM’s profit from the late 1930s were on Mickey Rooney’s cheap Andy Hardy series. Abbott and Costello or Hope and Crosby could rake it in with cheap production values. The smaller studios that made mostly B films could more easily transition into television where the production values were all B Grade or lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Thalberg, the next innovator was David Selznick that made deals with the big studios as an independent. Selznick was more successful after Gone with the Wind than I knew. He just never topped GWTW. He made a fairly good living loaning out his signed talent such as Hitchcock, Joan Fontaine, Ingrid Bergman, Joseph Cotton, Jennifer Jones. and Gregory Peck. He only made four films with Hitchcock in the 1940s. Hitchcock’s other films were loan outs. MCA agent Lew Wasserman would follow a similar pattern as Selznick in the 1950s by packing his clients to the studios. He was so successful that it led to running Universal Studios.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end of the studio system seemed to ruin the careers of a lot of great directors. With a few exceptions, Hitchcock, John Ford, Howard Hawks, George Stevens, William Wyler, Billy Wilder, and Frank Capra were finished making classics by the early 1960s. They couldn’t make those kinds of movies without being surrounded by the studio apparatus they took for granted. It does give some fuel to the idea that the auteur theory is overblown. They were the most talented directors of their generation, but without the supporting cast of writers and producers and set designers, their talent wasn’t enough. What I took from the book is that the studio system was kind of a fluke and the way it caught on like a virus gave the public a very unique kind of movie that will never quite be duplicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: Be sure to read the introduction at the beginning of the book. It almost works as a stand alone essay and gets you hooked before you ever start on the meat of the book.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Movies used to wholly produced by studios. Before the 1960s, the studios controlled every piece of production. They generated and formed the ideas, assigned the creative talent, and executed to the schedule proscribed by a production executive. Filmmaking was driven by the studios, not the filmmakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In “The Genius of the System,” author Thomas Schatz isn’t interested in taking a side on which way is better. He’s interested in tirelessly laying out the ways in which the studios used to produce movies. Schatz limits his research to four companies: MGM, Warner Brothers, Universal, and the companies run by David Selznick. The results are usually stimulating but sometimes exhausting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of Schatz’s best work is done on MGM, especially on the Thalberg era. Irving Thalberg implemented a central producer system, first at Universal and then at MGM, where films were planned from his office and the offices of his trusted associate producers. These men meticulously planned everything from pre-production all the way through post-production, which included numerous previews and reshoots if necessary. Thalberg, backed by Louis B. Mayer, learned to spend freely but never exorbitantly in order to achieve quality. The results spoke for themselves as MGM dominated the marketplace until Thalberg’s untimely death in 1936. While MGM still did well immediately following Thalberg’s death and for many years after, they would eventually fall back to the rest of the pack and even start to drag behind them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chapters on Warner Brothers are also intriguing. The little studio that sent the majors crashing into the sound era was never short on drama. Schatz describes how Warner Brothers developed their house style of socially relevant crime films. Something I didn’t realize was that Warners established their style while being the leader in movie musicals. But even their musicals, like 42nd Street and Gold Diggers of 1933, were always very much set in the Depression. Social relevance was always part of the Warners’ style.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best work has to do with the ongoing battles between stars and the Warners. Notoriously thrifty and sanctimonious with their talent, it seems like all of the stars at Warner Brothers rebelled at one time or another. Jimmy Cagney, Edward G. Robinson and others were constantly taking suspensions to protest against assignments they disagreed with. Perhaps no one fought with the Warners more than Bette Davis. It wasn’t until she sued and won that the Warners had to expand their worldview when it came to contract talent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Schatz does significant work on Hollywood’s first independent mega-producer, David O. Selznick. Sharp, brilliant, and utterly exhausting, Selznick was responsible for massive hits like Gone With the Wind. Selznick argued his way into MGM, moved onto RKO, and broke off on his own to tremendous success. I had no idea that Selznick was as much of an agent as he was a producer. Selznick made a nice profit loaning out his contract talent, like Alfred Hitchcock, to other studios. He also was one of the leading proponents of packaging talent for films, which is standard practice today. What also makes this fascinating is that packaging is the central issue in the current battle between the WGA and talent agents today. It’s a battle that won’t likely be won anytime soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The work on Universal was the least interesting to me. The best stuff is on the development of the horror film at Universal. Schatz outlines how talent like William Castle and Tod Browning developed and perfected a genre that endures with great strength today. Audiences will always want to be scared. And studios will always want to produce cheap, profitable product. Universal had a great run of it in the 1930s. But their lack of leadership and direction ultimately held them back.\n",
      "\n",
      "After reading this book I was amazed that the studio system functioned at all. It seemed like every movie, and I do mean every movie, ran over budget and over schedule. Most films had disastrous preview screenings which led to recuts, reshoots, and additional costs. The studio system seemed like organized chaos. It was the ones who understood it best, like Thalberg and Selznick, who made the most of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked most of the book but not all of it. Schatz spends significant time describing the production of movies I didn’t really care about. I don’t need ten pages on the rise of Deanna Durbin at Universal. But that’s probably a matter of personal taste more than it’s a criticism of the author. Another quibble is the text of the book is printed in small print. The book is 489 pages to begin with and when I have to work harder to read, it seems like a lot of effort. Again this isn’t a criticism of the author. It’s a criticism of the publishers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend The Genius of the System but with reservations. You have to be a hardcore classic movie fan to enjoy it. Those with a passing interest might be exhausted by it. Schatz is a good writer but he tends to write long sentences. They can wear down a reader. But as a hardcore classic film fan, I got a lot out of the book. There are movies in my dvr from TCM because I read about them in this book. It’s expanded my film palette and I learned a great deal. Not my favorite but definitely worth your time.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Investigates filmmaking from the 1920s to 1960 by looking at MGM, Warners, Universal, and David Selznick. Very focused on the business and the impact of producers. Excellent in many ways, although I spotted a couple errors. Scholarly but very readable.\n",
      "\n",
      "8/2/16: Forgetting I'd read this and not paying much attention to the book, purchased it today at a thrift store. OK, I'd glad I liked it. Really don't intend to read it again, but will be happy to have it.\n",

      "This book is very informative on the specifics of the Navajo connections between the spiritual world, astronomy and sand painting. It makes clear that the Navajo views of astronomy and time are so closely woven that it is a given in Navajo culture. The book in no way dismisses the topic as Native American spirituality or just a set of spiritual beliefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "An interesting thing to note is that very few outsiders to the Navajo culture have been allowed access to the sand paintings this author has been able to encounter. The ceremonial paintings and \"sings\", which are used to enable Navajo to retain their balance with the natural world and the spiritual beings who exist therein, are described delicately (there are some deliberate, respectful omissions) and in intricate detail where appropriate. This is the best book I've read so far, out of several, to describe these things in such a respectful way.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you get bogged down by detail or explanation - as the text has a very academic voice - this might not be for you. But the details are laced with a grasp of the culture that makes it easy to read for someone who isn't familiar with Native cultural beliefs. Lots of examples given. Lots of repetition with new details.\n",

      "I'd love to buy this book for my permanent collection, but the lowest going hardcover price is $110. I guess that says something about how good it is, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoyed this book and can honestly say I learned a lot about Imagineering, which I wasn't expecting after reading Marty Sklar's \"Mickey's Ten Commandments\" (a bit of a letdown in terms of educational content). I wasn't overly impressed with the first half of the book (had it ended there, I would have only give it three stars). A lot of it was common sense (e.g. be consistent, don't overstimulate) and on the whole, forgettable; but some of it was provoking in its simplistic ingenuity. For example, the concept of wienies - an object that beacons someone in with its design and placement - makes so much sense; and knowing that everything inside a Disney park from its buildings to its bushes is designed *as* a story makes me appreciate their details and congruity even more.\n",
      "\n",
      "But where this book really shines is in its chapters on characters and color. I learned more about using color in these 35 pages than in every art book and class I ever took combined. Hench explains the uses of literally every single major color and how the colors react to their environments in the park. For example, they had to paint the castles in each park a different shade because the \"blue skies\" in Paris, Orlando, Hong Kong, etc. all contain different hues, skewing the perceived colors. It was fascinating to learn how they counteracted this problem, which presented itself every single day. Before they paint anything (a building, say) they actually paint 4x4 boards with single colors and lay them in front of the environment during different times of the day and weather to see how it reads to the eye. The amount of work they put into every detail seems unfathomable.\n",

      "I find his teachings in character (consistency), color (emotion evocation), storytelling, and place (milieu) applicable not only to theme park creation, but also to my work in app development, user interfaces, character design, technical problem solving, and creative storytelling. He teaches down to the details while staying general enough to transcend boundaries of profession and discipline. He draws from familiar examples -- Mickey's characteristics, Disneyland rides like Space Mountain -- but shines a new light on them, showcasing their stories in the mold of challenges: turning the 2D of animation into the 3D of walkaround park counterparts, and devising the proper settings in which to show each character. At first, I thought the text was too dumbed down and basic to be enlightening, but as John Hench stringed together basic examples to concoct more complicated solutions -- like his way of fitting buildings into Main Street, spewing water from a fountain, or breathing new life into a derelict theme restaurant -- I quickly realized that this was not a dumbing down: it was well-written simplicity, breaking a grueling task down into its understandable, applicable constituent parts and lessons.\n",

      "The first section, about show, is going to be very unsurprising to anyone who has read any other Imagineering book. The sections about visual storytelling, character, and color certainly have some overlap with other Imagineering books, but it's less. Visual storytelling and character have a lot about adapting animation ideas to theme parks, and the color section was probably what I found most new and interesting. (Lots about aging, using different shades at different heights so that they look like the same color, thinking about reflection, etc.)\n",

      "Nora Roberts Land is book one in the Dare Valley series by Ava Miles. Country Heaven was the first book I read by Ava Miles, and I completely fell in love with it. So, when I decided to start this series by her, I knew I would enjoy it. But, I got so much more than that. If you are a fan of Nora Roberts you will enjoy this book with its frequent references to the many books written by Nora Roberts and the characters within. But if you have never read a book by Nora Roberts, you will still enjoy this. Ava’s characters are full of life, complex, and so easy to relate to.\n",

      "Meredith Hale, granddaughter of the acclaimed Arthur Hale, founder of The Western Independent, followed in her grandfather and father’s footsteps and became a journalist. She married journalist Richard Sommerville, thinking he was “the one.” But he wasn’t. It has been one year since her divorce. Richard convinced Meredith that her obsession with Nora Roberts books and the idea of finding that Happily Ever After is what ruined their marriage. That she has an unrealistic idea of what love is. Meredith’s family needs her to come home for a few months to help with her family’s newspaper so she decides that this is the time. She will go home and help out and also write her own story. She will begin dating again in Dare Valley and prove that there really is a “Nora Roberts Land.” That there really can be a Happily Ever After.”\n",

      "Tanner McBride is a wartime journalist and has just returned to New York. He needs a rest. And New York is just the place for him. He has a meeting with Richard Sommerville, thinking this is his chance to work for his newspaper. What he didn’t realize is that he was about to become a pawn in Richard’s scheme to control his ex-wife. He has something on Tanner and will use it to get Tanner to do his bidding. He wants Tanner to go to Dare Valley and make Meredith fall in love with him, then break her heart, so that Meredith can’t write her article about Nora Roberts Land. Richard is afraid that Meredith will paint him in a negative light casting a shadow on his potential run for Senate.\n",

      "Neither Tanner or Meredith had any idea what they were in for in Dare Valley. They both realize the importance of family and friendship. And neither were expecting the instant electrical connection between them. They began by meeting each morning at the swimming pool, both having been college competitive swimmers and going for coffee afterwards at Meredith’s sister Jill’s coffee shop. A slow trust develops. Small town life is not what Tanner had planned for. But he slowly grows to love this community. He even gave in and took in a stray dog that was hanging around his house and named him Hugo. Hugo became his protector and companion for life.\n",

      "There was so much more to Nora Roberts Land than I anticipated. I thought it would be a fun romantic tale but it turned out to be that and also, a suspenseful page turner, keeping me on the edge of my seat until the very last minute. And not only did I fall in love with Meredith and Tanner, but all the secondary characters as well. I plan to go directly into the next book about Jill, Meredith’s sister and continue my adventure in Dare Valley, Colorado.\n",

      "\n",
      "Meredith's husband, \" Rick the Dick\", told her that reading Nora Roberts novels gave her unrealistic expectations about love and marriage. When she finds herself divorced, she thinks maybe her ex- husband was right. There was no happy ever after in real life.\n",
      "\n",
      "When her family needs some help running the Dare Valley newspaper in Colorado, Meredith gets an idea. Maybe she can prove Rick was wrong about Nora Roberts and \"happily ever afters\". Meredith decides to do an article on the subject which makes Rick mighty nervous. Why? Well, Rick is running for a seat in the Senate and if Meredith's article comes out it could make him look bad and even expose some dark secrets that would ruin his political career. The solution? Tanner McBride.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tanner has returned to the states after being a war correspondent.. His first assignment upon returning home? To seduce his boss's ex-wife, make her fall in love with him, and then dump her, proving once and for all that true love only happens in fairy tales... or in Nora Roberts Land.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why would a seasoned journalist like Tanner take on such an assignment? Blackmail of course. It seems Rick has some sordid information on Tanner's brother that he will make public if Tanner doesn't follow through. So, Tanner finds himself in Dare Valley, Colorado. When he meets his target, he knows his heart is in big trouble. So, will Tanner be able to find a way out of this situation or will he have to break Meredith's heart to protect his family?\n",
      "\n",
      "While Tanner is laying the groundwork for getting to know Merideth, a suspicious death occurs which has some people thinking a coverup is underway. When Merideth and Tanner begin asking questions they find themselves in danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if the name of this book doesn't grab you, I don't know what will. Ava Miles takes a page from the modern queen of romance authors and creates her very own masterpiece while paying homage to true love and happy ever after.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meredith really took her divorce hard. She vowed never to become involved with a journalist again. When Tanner arrives in Dare Valley, Meredith is dating every man she can, looking for her very own 'book boyfriend\". While her sister, Jill, and her grandfather all insist Tanner is perfect for her, she still holds out... well as long as she can anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Tanner is trying to protect his family by going along with this farce, I think deep down in his soul he knows he can't really crush Merideth like her ex husband wants him to. He just doesn't know now to extricate himself from the situation without someone getting hurt.\n",

      "I really, really, really, enjoyed this book! Meredith went from panic attacks to taking on 'Rick the Dick', with dignity, intelligence and grace, all while proving that even if Prince Charming is just a fairytale, true love is real and not just in Nora Roberts Land.\n",

      "\n",
      "Authors writing books based on their love for other authors and the fictional characters created are quickly become some of my fave reads( see K.C. Dyer's Finding Fraser, Shannon Hale's Austenland and Catherine McKenzie's Arranged). Nora Roberts is a gal that tends to receive her share of her lovers and haters. Personally, I tend to find them fluffy and fun and good palate cleansers, especially after a heavy read. When I saw this advertised freebie, I was fairly intrigued to see for myself what Ava Miles would bring to the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "The premise is well described in the Goodreads synopsis and so I won't rehash it here. First of all, Second, the From main protagonists Meredith and Tanner, to their loveable family members Jill, Peggy, Keith, and patriarch, Arthur Hale. I knew within a few chapters that they had become my new favorite fictional peeps! Third, So not only do readers get the fairytale romance, we also get the intriguing premise of our two journalists trying to solve the baffling death of a few locals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, there is also many references to NR's books and characters which Meredith and her sister, Jill use as a guideline for her \"man bender\" to find their own Nora hero. If I have any complaints, it probably might be that what I find irritating in a Nora Roberts ' book(like constantly talking about what the characters are wearing) is exactly appropriate in this book because Meredith and Tanner are archetypes that walk straight off the pages into Ava Miles ' story. So, well done on that score!\n",
      "\n",
      "There are 11 books in this series and while I am not sure if I can really commit myself to on my TBR right now. I cannot help but confess an interest in finding out if Jill and Brian will work through their complicated past or if Tanner's police officer sister, Peggy will meet a man who will be good to her and her son, Keith. Oh and there is also going to be a story about Meredith and Jill's grandfather....\n",

      "The set up\n",
      "Meredith Hale is still reeling from her recent divorce. Her slimy ex-husband accused her of having unrealistic expectations from their marriage because of her \"obsession\" with Nora Roberts romance books. She hasn't read any since the divorce, her confidence shaken and believing maybe he was right. Now he's planning a U. S. Senate run and wants her to keep quiet about the details of their split, insinuating publicly that she was the problem. Now she's out to prove her romance novels aren't fantasy and she's going to publish an article about her experience in her high profile newspaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tanner McBride, an international correspondent who just returned from Afghanistan, is hired by Meredith's husband and blackmailed into wooing her and then dumping her. Problem is Tanner is really falling for Meredith and the two of them are also working closely together to uncover a drug ring in Dare Valley. It's dangerous business and Tanner is caught in a vicious situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The story takes place in Dare Valley, Colorado, Meredith's home town, and the small city dynamics work well (she decides her chances of finding her HEA are better there than New York City). Her grandfather, a nationally renowned newspaperman, and her younger sister, Jill, are strong personalities that make things even livelier. The family presence is important to the story and not just props or window dressing.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I started this book, I was unaware of the suspense element and it was a very nice surprise. It added lots of tension and was woven very well with the romance and the mystery surrounding the drug ring. Tanner and Meredith worked as a couple, not lacking for steam or sensuality, and she made him work hard. And, the payoff was excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, there were many references to Nora Roberts titles and characters so if you're a fan, as I am, it's a pretty nice trip down memory lane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Meredith drove me a bit nuts with her insecurities, considering she was an accomplished journalist in a high profile job and from a well known newspaper family. I had a tough time seeing her in that role given how easily she lost confidence and fell prone to panics. Not a big nit, but it was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved this story! Honestly, I thought it might be a little cheesy (NOT) and couldn't be happier to have discovered this gem. It's well written with strong character development, an interesting plot and plenty of emotional tension. I am so utterly addicted to this series and am almost finished with the second book. And, I plan to jump right into the third.\n",

While I agree that I wish Holo had figured it out on her own, I must also point out that how can you figure something out when you don't have all the pieces? In that sense, I do not doubt that Holo didn't solve the puzzle before the end of the story, and so the author didn't diminish her knowledge.\n",

      "As much as I enjoyed reading this, I feel like this was one of the weaker volumes of Spice and Wolf. Despite the gimmicky narration of Norah's story, the last one in this volume, it was really pleasant and sweet. It had a bit of a set-up for a new series feel to it, with fully formed characters getting introduced and immediately pushed out of frame, but that wasn't too bothersome. I was much less charmed by Holo's solo story, though, which seemed to undercut her intelligence in earlier books in favor of having a story where she admits to having to understand the world of merchants while fussing about a particularly egregious accessory. The story about Lawrence trying to buy her gifts while she silently scorns him almost makes up for this, but not quite.\n",

      "The two star rating for this book is probably a bit low, but in the absence of a 2 and 1/2 star rating, I'm going with it. I don't think this book does anything to derail the series. It just feels kind of unnecessary.\n",

      "In this volume, there are three stories that focus on Holo and Lawrences, featuring the best of their heartwarming moments, casual banter and clever remarks. One of them is even told from Holo's perspective, which is always a nice surprise and an interesting change of pace. The other one, which takes up almost half the book, follows Norah and Ennek as they travel to Gustav in search of wor. Interestingly enough, this story is told from Ennek's perspective. In this series, animals and animal spirits have a special focus. Ennek was quite humanized and overly so in my opinion, but it was another interesting change of pace.\n",

      "What can I say? Esther, your writing is wonderful, funny, sad, poignant, silly, and more…Reading your words is like listening to you. Hearing your voice would be better, but having your words is good too. To your \"I love you\" I respond the way we did many nights as I tucked you into bed: \"I love you more.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "I have had this book and hundreds of books on my shelves forever. I still do. I have been trying to read as many as possible before my own fight against cancer begins in a week. I started getting mad and just grabbing a lot of books for mom to sell Monday before we go in the afternoon to get a mold of my pelvis. And... I came across this book on my shelf. I have had the hardback forever! I felt like God (yeah, GOD!) sent me back to that shelf for one more go around.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found this book and realized it was about a girl that died of cancer. Well obviously I felt I had to read it right then and I did!\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing that turned me off is finding out the stuff about John Green. Yes, he wrote a great introduction but reading about how he used Ester to write his own book turned me right off. If someone inspires you to write a book about them then I'm all for that, but this just seemed weird. I don't know - enough about him. I'm glad I'm one of the few that picked up the book for what it was about and knew nothing about Ester. I guess I never read his acknowledgment in his book or movie.\n",
      "\n",
      "I WISH there were tons more books like this - kids, the elderly, whoever writing their story about whatever disease they might have. There are a few books here and there that have been written that have some of my same mental disorders and they all helped me in their own way. This book did the same. There were things here and there that got through to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also loved reading about interactions with Esther and her sibs, especially her brothers. Reading about her fangirling about Harry Potter and finding out about these Harry Potter bands and different groups of people I have never heard of in my life. I don't like social media that much and I don't watch the news or talk shows so I'm mostly out of the loop and I could care less.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved so much that Esther had all of these online friend in her group and her make a wish was to get together with them. Just little things here and there.\n",

      "Dear Esther,\n",
      "I just finished reading your published book. Yeah, that's right! Your dream of becoming an author has come true. I feel so honored to be a part of that goal. I woke up at 8:30 this morning to buy this book. I went in and bought the book as soon as the doors opened. (They hadn't even put the book out on display yet!) I felt honored to be one of the first to hold this in my hand.\n",
      "I am amazed at your outlook on life and death. I've never been spiritual or religious, so death is kinda feared for me. I was so astounded at your ability to say that death is just a part of life that you'll experience no matter what. You said that you have a hard time putting emotions into words, so maybe you did fear death.\n",
      "I cried when you died in the book. I didn't cry because I was grieving per se. I cried because of how much you missed out on. I cried because you always wanted to kiss a boy and you never got to. I cried because you can't watch Doctor Who anymore. In books, I'm used to simple things like that working out. I guess you really put it right in front of my face that a lot of things don't work out in life.\n",
      "You kept saying how lazy you were and how you wished you were actually helping people. You are, Esther. The foundation This Star Won't Go Out was inspired by you and know you're helping other sick kids. You're letting others learn the secrets behind life, due to how wise you were. I'm going to become an oncology researcher, Esther. I decided that a long time ago, but this book has made me realize only more how much I need to become an oncology researcher to help combat this awful dream.\n",
      "To be honest, getting cancer is the scariest thing in life for me. I can't imagine a worth death or sentence. It seems so scary Esther, but you handled it so well. At least, that's what was present in your writing.\n",
      "We'll miss you here Esther, but just know that you're still with us and you influence what a lot of people do. Just remember, don't forget to be awesome.\n",

      "Many readers have had the pleasure of reading by the very talented author, John Green. John actually dedicated his book\n",
      "and in his acknowledgments stated\n",
      "After reading both the dedication and acknowledgement, I was intrigued to find out just who Esther Earl was. It did not take me long to learn that Esther (meaning \"Star\") was a phenomenal young lady. In November 2006, aged 12, she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and had already developed extensive tumors in her lungs. For four years she endured surgery, chemotherapy, and medications as she balanced the demands of a terminal illness with a teenager’s desire for fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tethered by tubes to oxygen tanks that helped her breathe, Esther spoke to the world from her bedroom via the internet (she began making You Tube videos in late 2008 under the name ). A vibrant member of online communities, she formed lasting friendships with people around the world, charming thousands with her dimpled smile and cheery, loving presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Esther was a huge Harry Potter fan, as well as a dedicated \"Nerdfighter\". She invoked an iconic phrase from the online Nerdfighter community when she signed an entry,\n",
      "She became a celebrity when John Green posted a YouTube video encouraging people to vote “with Esther’’ in a contest. The prize was a $250,000 grant, and the outpouring for Esther garnered so many votes that the award went to the Harry Potter Alliance, a nonprofit founded in the US that promotes human rights, literacy, and disaster relief efforts.\n",

      "is a glimpse into Esther's life, via a scrapbook-like biography told through Esther's own drawings, diary entries, handwritten notes, stories from her family, and a letter from one of her doctors. There is a beautiful and heartfelt introduction to the book by John Green:\n",
      "A few days after turning 16 and a couple of weeks before she died, Esther set aside her normal playful demeanor and mused about how difficult it is to separate the twined strands of identity and illness.\n",
      "After her death the foundation was created by her family in her honor to financially help other young people struggling with cancer. Additionally, every year on Esther's birthday, August 3rd, people across the world participate in Esther day, a celebration of Esther's life and, as Esther requested, love and family.\n",
      "\n",
      "is an encouraging and inspirational read about an empathetic and joyful young lady, so wise beyond her years, who loved so deeply and genuinely. She was focussed daily on a mission to comfort and care for others, and no matter what pain and agony she might have been going through, she refused to abandon her family and friends.\n",

      "\n",
      "The thing is, this book isn't quite what I expected, and something wasn't sitting right with me about the book as a symbol. Halfway through I formed my opinion as to why. I'll explain.\n",

      "The gripes of the above reviewer mirror most of my concerns but there's more to it than that. I have another beef with the publisher, DUTTON, an imprint of PENGUIN BOOKS. It's the same publisher as THE FAULT IN OUR STARS. That made me raise an eyebrow. And the intro of this book was the best writing in the book. And who wrote that? John Green.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's my beef:\n",
      "\n",
      "Tragically, REALLY REALLY tragically, teenagers die from cancers. It's F'd up, but it happens. I respect Esther, her story, and I know it's important. But all of those other teens did not get books about their lives and stories, and some of them may have had just as nice families or friends or wisdoms to share. Maybe they wanted to be writers, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't throw stones at me yet. I'm saying this: If I'm being really honest about the whole publication of this book, I think it's a bit of a cash grab. I'm sure the people who would love this book the most ar ethe people who knew Esther personally, and some of the money is probably going to a foundation. Still..... I opened this review by saying I didn't want to be a douche, and I don't think I'm being one, but this feels cash-grabby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, when the biggest YA book of the decade is still rolling out millions of copies, and months before the big movie premiere, this rolls out? My other eyebrow goes up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Believe it or not, and I know I'm getting controversial and probably pissing people off, I picked up this book knowing that I would give it five stars, FIVE!, and recommend it to anyone with a heartbeat. I WAS READY TO FALL IN LOVE, BE INSPIRED! -- but I cannot. I was not.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's all laid out in John Green's introduction: Esther, a wonderful girl, bumped into a famous author at a convention, and then she got famous because of him and he got more famous because of her, and John Green's publisher approached Esther Earl's parents, (but no other teens with cancer because they didn't know John Green) and published this book. A weighty volume, beautifully rendering her lifetime, on dense paper with heavy subject matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as I read the first 200 pages and skimmed thoughtfully and patiently through the next 200, I asked myself -- \"Besides showing how normal and sweet and generous and loving she is, and inspiring us to live better like most cancer stories do, what specifically did Esther's life or talents impart on us that I didn't already know about being a good person already? What does she get a book nationally published while others did not?\"\n",

      "‘There is no place for an artist here any more. He has been officially dismissed in favor of the entertainer.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Gilbert Sorrentino mourns the artist, the true purveyor of prose drowning in the growing mass of fakers and sell-outs whose false glamour makes them the candle in which the literary flies will be immolate themselves. Through the voice of his spurned narrator, each chapter dissects the little-to-no-talented lives of several archetypal artists in the 50’s and 60’s New York art world and pins the autopsy up in hilariously brutal rants. is the perfect novel to read alongside Rilke’s ; while Rilke builds a beautiful portrait of prose to empower one down the path of good writing and places warning signs to direct away from pitfalls, Sorrentino investigates the dangerous wayward souls. Within his scathing assaults on the artistic society of his times, Sorrentino delivers a poignant satirical commentary on the forms and fixtures of both good and bad writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘’ Sorrentino’s narrator writes, ‘’ Each crumbling life highlights the fakery and falseness that he felt plagued his world and his examinations expose the inner pretentiousness and weaknesses in us all. The comedy is rich, the voice sharp and cutting, and nobody is able to reach the other side without seeing a bit of themselves in his attacks. With any hope, Sorrentino’s message reaches the readers hearts and reminds them to purify their artistic souls and do what is right for their work. Across each chapter is an artist whose weakness in character and life is transposed into the art they hide behind. They suffer self-loathing and each other as they wed and bed their way through artistic circles. They suffer ‘’ Yet, despite all their poor abilities and shameful habits, they manage to make a name for themselves while our bitter narrator, with his wealth of knowledge, remains the recipient of rejection letters.\n",
      "Sorrentino has much to say about the art game. ‘’ he writes, ‘’However, Sorrentino warns against a world where it is those who succeed in their environment trump the true ‘good students’. It is a world of ‘’ that plague their own world with their shallowness and fakery. It isn’t just the bad authors, but those who receive them as well – the critics and readers. The attacks on critics and editors are some of the most aggressive, despite his insistence that all he really needs a good review. He writes of these critics ‘’ The real artist is ‘’ While the critics want what is real and good, they reject it for what entertains, what sells, with no regard for the health of literature.\n",
      "Art leaves a residue in the hearts of its readers/viewers where it grows in society. Sorrentino warns that as we embrace poor art in place of pure art, we allow the bad to flourish with more and more bad art while the true artist withers. We embrace it because it is easy, because it is attractive, appeals to our baseness, our sexuality, but not our intelligence. We circle the flame of fakery and burn up in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book will bring about endless laughter and exhaust the ink supply of your favorite pen if you try to underline every brilliant passage. However, the characters are only funny through Sorrentino’s scathing criticisms. ‘’ The metafictional qualities of this novel is the true charm. Sorrentino never lets the reader drift into their illusions and consistently reminds them that these characters are just that – fictional characters. They represent the falseness he despises, and while they may be an amalgamation of people Sorrentino knew in real life, they are only ‘’ He has a gift for creating believable characters out of archetypes by always showing how he doesn’t ‘’ and having them act in strange ways that even he writes about not understanding. There is an incredibly impressive balance between creating characters that seem to walk right off the page (a few that he claims impose themselves on the novel despite his desire to keep them out of it), yet always keeping the reader grounded in their knowledge that these characters – the narrator included – are fictions. Like how a tiger in a zoo becomes an object of amusement instead of a dangerous predator, Sorrentino chains the enemies of art up in prose and cages them behind the bars of his fiction where they cannot harm us.\n",
      "\n",
      "His breaks from the story often place emphasis on his own literary devices beyond character creation. He often jokingly offers possible futures for his characters, subtly touching upon how each serves a literary purpose and chastises the plot devices that would appear as overly cliché (especially when using these devices to serve just that ironic purpose). His arrogance and exasperation against possible critiques on his style make for wonderful rants.\n",
      "There is this comical heart to the novel that instructs in writing as well as deconstructs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorrentino’s brutal assessment of his artistic society is one of the funniest and well-written satires on American literature. While much of the allusions may seem out-dated, such as references to publishing houses from the 50’s and 60’s, the message is incredibly relevant to any writer in any era. It rewards the reader who is well-read enough to understand many of the jokes and be familiar with some of the authors lambasted within (Norman Mailer is repeatedly poked and prodded), yet it is entertaining to anyone looking for a few shots at the artistic world. Anyone and everyone receives a punch to the teeth in this novel, the reader included, and we all walk away better for it.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "\" is a comic novel. In many places it may be “gallows humor” but it’s basically a comic novel. I know that I laughed often when I was writing it. I laughed at the situations I put my characters in, I laughed at the comments my narrator made about the characters, I laughed at the various zany lists I made up in order to exemplify aspects of their personalities.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So relates Gilbert Sorrentino, American literary author par excellence, in a discussion of his work with editor John O'Brien. Mr. Sorrentino goes on to outline what's involved in creating first-rate fiction. Here are two key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "Fiction Is Its Own Reality - Fiction should not be seen as taking the place of reality. \"The idea of the mirror being held up to life is a very remote one as far as my fictional thinking goes.\" In other words, fiction is not to be confused with a mirror image of our everyday, practical, day-to-day existence. For me, as a reader new to Gilbert Sorrentino, I take the author's words here as a signal to read as a world unto itself, far removed from an exercise in sociology or culture studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fiction Requires Exactitude and Expertise - For Gilbert Sorrentino, writing fiction demands an expert's skill: \"The point of art is literally the making of something that is beautiful, the making of something that works, if you will forgive me, in a “machinelike” way.\" Here I think of the precision of Donald Judd's sculptures or the clean lines in architecture created by Frank Lloyd Wright or Louis Kahn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But the best writers excise sentimentality from their work because sentimentality is death to fiction. You can be a weeper in your life, you can cry in the movies as it were, but you can’t cry in your work because none of that is anything but destructive to fiction, which has got to be extremely cold. Let the reader cry if he wants.\" Tell it like it is, Gilbert! The takeaway message: a fiction writer must maintain a certain cool, craft-like mindset to ensure his or her words and images are the right ones for the story being told.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recognizing Gilbert Sorrentino's rigorous approach to writing, we can better appreciate his statement: \"The idea that writing comes hot off the griddle seems to me to be a tyro’s idea of writing. Writing is very hard work, often absolute drudgery.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to the novel under review, one fact should be made abundantly clear: although the author shares a number of views with the story's narrator, most notably a hatred for superficial lifestyles and mediocre writing and art, Gilbert Sorrentino is NOT the tale's narrator.\n",
      "\n",
      "To allay any possible confusion on this point, Gilbert Sorrentino posits, \"voice is not in any sense the projection of the writer’s voice into the writing. One of the great problems with learning how to write is to discover that in terms of fiction all voices are invented voices.\" And applied specifically to the narrator of , the author responds to the accusation that his narrator is a wiseguy: \"I defend myself against that description because I think of my narrator not as a wiseguy but as a guy wearing a succession of masks and no one ever finds out who he really is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I highlight the distinction between author and narrator for a definite reason: is, above all else, a scathing, scalding, savage attack of the New York art scene of the 1950s and 1960s, most directly focusing on eight artists and writers. But how removed is the narrator from also sharing much of the superficiality? What type of narrator would compose lists of what people like and don't like, what people would be better off being? What's the depth of character when a narrator admits \"what a pleasure to make him up (a character), so that I can put him down\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "The eight art scene hipsters are, in fact, superficial, admitting they write mediocre poetry or paint mediocre paintings but say they are living the life of a hip artist as part of the vital art scene; all the while admitting, in turn, their life is a shambles and their relationships a mess but, hey, I'm a published poet, etc. etc.. In effect, circular reasoning as a colossal excuse for creating crap art and living a crap life.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, damn, is the narrator any better? What an arrogant, condescending priss! Forever attempting to shift the spotlight from himself by an assortment of tricks - footnotes to his ongoing commentary, quoting others' bad poetry, cataloging his characters' perverse sexual activity. Of course, he does periodically remind us this is a fiction, he is the author . . . but still.\n",
      "\n",
      "is the type of multilayered work that will appeal to scholars (indeed there is a Casebook Study in devoted to the novel) as well as those readers taken by finely constructed, demanding texts such as by William Gaddis, by William Gass and by Raymond Queneau (Gilbert Sorrentino himself wrote glowing reviews of each). Up for the challenge? If so, go for it - pick up this book.\n",

I do not have the faintest about what the author may have intended and I am probably typing out a bullshit non-review full of cloying platitudes. After all, I may be an even bigger phony than the phony artists who go about living their phony, make-believe lives with their phonier sounding names in this book. (Dick Detective? seriously?)\n",

Hence my memories of reading this are a rough compilation of coherent moments interspersed with perplexing gaps of no valid recollections of any reactions (possibly due to some of the myriad literary references I did not get); some of these moments inspired muffled guffaws, some drew out a few snickers, some pushed my in-built 'cringe' button ever so frequently, while some of the repetitive portions made me yawn.\n",

Written in a version of Old English created by the author for layman readers, I didn't know what to expect. But what I think should be made clear is that Paul Kingsnorth didn't write this novel intending it to be a chore for the reader. The story is fascinatingly alien, and utterly relevant to a time we can only try and imagine. I appreciate Kingsnorth's reasoning in the note on the language:\n",

      "And he's right. Ever get annoyed reading modern morals in a character of historical fiction? I bet Kingsnorth would too, but by taking the brilliant extra steps with language he's created something magical. It nourishes the story, never detracting from the tale.

Buccmaster is cocky, outspoken, and probably schizophrenic, but oddly riveting in an endearing sort of way. Except for the homicidal tendencies of course. But it's 1066, and his entire world is in turmoil. The journey is dark, but dreamy, and I was sad to see it end. Not that I was expecting otherwise, but I'll be honest, this one caught me off guard.\n",

      "\n",
      "From a linguistic perspective: I don't think I've ever read a historical novel that did a better job of bringing the reader into the mind and culture of a character. Kingsnorth has created a vocabulary for this novel based on the language of the time. It's not Old English - but it's influenced by it. At first, it makes the reading slow going. I normally read very quickly, but I found myself lingering over each word, thinking about the tones and rhythms of the language, imagining how the words would sound from the mouths of the characters.\n",

      "When we think of post-apocalyptic fiction we tend to think specifically of science fiction (or at least I know I do). Our vision is usually either of a near-future survival thriller about the fall of current human civilization into ruin (most often as the result of a nuclear holocaust, an ecological disaster, or more recently due to those pesky zombies), or of the far-future as we witness the after-effects on a society that has fallen into utter barbarity and ruin. We tend to see the apocalypse, understandably, as truly world-ending on a global scale wherein the entirety of human civilization has been laid waste, but what about an apocalypse that is more restricted in its geographical extent? What about one that impacts ‘only’ a single nation or a culture? What about an apocalypse that happens not in the future or near-present, but one that lies in the distant past? We think, or hope, of apocalypses (apocalypsi?) as rare events, something so inconceivable that it could only happen when the blue moon shines, but when we broaden our definitions just a little and look beyond only those events that shatter the globe and also turn our vision from the future to the past we may start to see a world that was riddled with apocalypses; a world where cultures thrived and died on a regular basis. It would seem that in many ways the apocalypse has been a fact of life for humanity since our infancy. Countries, cultures, whole civilizations were destroyed as a matter of course throughout most of human history and Paul Kingsnorth’s _The Wake_ is a tale of one such apocalypse.\n",
      "\n",
      "1066 is a famous year. Even those ignorant of many ‘major’ historical events likely know that this was the year that William (alternately ‘the Bastard’ and ‘the Conqueror’) of Normandy invaded England and defeated then-king Harold Godwinson and subjugated a people. This subjugation was particularly harsh, even in an age known for the harshness of war, and ultimately involved the destruction (or was it a transmutation?) of a people through the decimation of their language, their rights, and, ultimately for many, of their lives. The Anglo-Saxon culture that then held sway (admittedly itself a race of conquerors on the island) was overcome by the culture of France and a way of life was seemingly decimated almost overnight. Landowners lost their rights and privileges to a crown with new and far-reaching powers; speakers of the Anglo-Saxon tongue found themselves ruled by a people that neither knew, nor cared to know, their language or ways; nearly the entire ruling class was decimated and those beneath them learned that even the yoke they once bore was perhaps not so bad a thing when compared to the new one. What is less well known is that there was, for several years, a guerilla war waged on the Norman invaders by some of the remaining Saxon population. This war, while ultimately fruitless, was the last hope of many for retaining their way of life and it is the story of one such rebel that we are told in Kingsnorth’s novel.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing to note before this review goes any further is that Kingsnorth has basically created his own language in this novel and it could be a stumbling block for some. He calls this language a “shadow tongue” since it is a fabricated version of English that incorporates many Old English words and grammatical structures in an attempt to incorporate a sense of verisimilitude with the era in which the story takes place without actually writing it in Old English. It could thus be compared to what Russell Hoban did in , though I would argue that this is a bit easier to slide into (esp. if you have any background in basic OE syntax and vocabulary). There is also a helpful glossary at the back of the book for some of the more opaque words and terms used in the text. I think, as with Hoban’s use of an invented language, Kingsnorth’s experiment is not merely a gimmick and ultimately succeeds. I find far too often that historical fiction fails due to being little more than modern characters dressed up in historical drag. I wouldn’t say that attempting to recreate a dead language in a way that can (mostly) be read by modern audiences is the sole solution to this problem, but in this case it definitely went a long way towards immersing the reader into what is effectively a different world, and certainly a different mindset. When we have to meet the narrator on his own terms due to the language used we are forced to leave many of our preconceptions at the door. Of course the fact that I have at least a smattering of Old English definitely helped me in acclimating myself fairly quickly, but I would strongly encourage any readers, even without this background, to still put in the effort. Once you’ve picked up the gauntlet dropped by Kingsnorth I think you’ll find that after a few chapters the words that were previously giving you headaches start to roll naturally off the tongue.\n",

      "We open on the eve of the Norman invasion and are introduced to Buccmaster of Holland (a region of eastern England, not the Netherlands) our stalwart narrator and a “socman a man of the wapentac [who] has three oxgangs” which ultimately translates to “an important man of influence and means beholden to none” (a fact of which he is eager to remind us every chance he gets). Buccmaster tells us his tale of tragedy and woe as he recalls the day that everything started to go wrong and all of the events that followed in its wake. It was, as is usually the case, a day much like any other aside from the fact that he witnessed an omen, a strange bird in the sky, that led him to believe that changes were in the air. His feeble attempts at warning others fall on deaf ears and we soon learn that Buccmaster is an atavism amongst his own people, a man of the old ways as taught to him by his grandfather who has rejected the “hwit crist” and the wave of change that has already come and significantly changed the traditions and beliefs of his people. As a result he is not only something of an outcast and recluse in his own small community, but also already in a position of bemoaning the lost past of his people even before the great apocalypse that will truly decimate his culture has arrived.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is interesting to note that despite the tragedies that we come to see befall Buccmaster: the loss of his position, the burning of his home, the disappearance and probable death of his sons, the rape and murder of his wife, Buccmaster never becomes a sympathetic character. He is a man, we quickly come to realize, who is neither likeable nor trustworthy. His words always serve a specific purpose - his own perceived best interest – and while it seems fairly clear (to me at least) that he is not deceiving us on purpose it is equally clear that his entire perception of reality and the events that go on around him are skewed. Ironically it is his own words that betray him. As we hear the constant justifications, the repeated assurances of his own worth, power, and rightness, the continual complaints about the wrongs to which he has been subjected (by both his enemies and his friends) we begin to question Buccmaster’s grasp on reality. As Buccmaster falls further and further from his position of relative comfort and influence, or as obstacles to his unquestioned authority arise, we start to hear the voices in his head. These voices whisper to him that the old gods have returned and hand-picked Buccmaster himself to bring back their ancient ways to his people and overcome the invaders. Unable to accept that he is no more than an outcast and outlaw living like a beast in the forest, Buccmaster must instead see himself as the ordained saviour of his people and their ancient way of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might wonder how book with a main character whose catalogue of faults and crimes matches that of Buccmaster could be readable, let alone enjoyable, but I found _The Wake_ to be both. Buccmaster is no saint, he’s not even a likeable sinner, but his story of loss, decline, and madness is a compelling one. As we are given more and more glimpses of both past and present events and the story of his life begins to unpeel like the skin of a rotting onion we start to see the full tragedy of Buccmaster’s life and understand that the last greatest calamity of the overthrow and destruction of his people was simply the final nail in the coffin - the last straw in a long line of sins, disappointments and defeats. It sounds an utterly gloomy tale, and while it certainly isn’t full of a lot of chuckles, I still found it to be compelling and not so much depressing as harrowing. The apocalypse of the Norman invasion may have left the globe at large much as it had been before it occurred – changes in regime happen every day after all – but it was no less world-ending for that to the people that lived through it and came out the other side into a world, a reality, which they could no longer understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The Wake_ is a fine piece of historical fiction that not only incorporates a truly intriguing narrative technique and linguistic structure, but also proves to be a powerful meditation on loss, culture, and the ways we define ourselves as both individuals and members of a wider community. Definitely recommended, though not for the faint of heart.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Outstanding novel about a landowner in Lincolnshire – Buccmaster of Holland – set in the years 1066-1068. Buccmaster, even before the Norman invasion, is apart from his fellow fen dwellers, still, like his grandfather but not his father, a follower of the Old Gods and a rejecter of the Church; also someone convinced he has through his Grandfather been chosen and marked out by the legendary blacksmith Weland (whose sword he believes he owns).\n",
      "\n",
      "At the start of 1066 he believes he sees various ill omens – he refuses to participate in the fights against either the Danish or Norman invasion, his children do fight and are killed in the second and shortly after (as reprisals for not paying taxes to the French and while Buccmaster is absent) his farm is burned down and his wife killed. He escapes to the woods, joining up with a servant and then a young boy – initially avoiding the French, the boy’s hero worship challenges him into killing a French knight (leading to vicious reprisals on the village) and in turn gathering a small band of outlaws around him. His band kills various Frenchmen over time, but Buccmaster is clearly reluctant to commit actions to match his words and even his self-image, he is challenged verbally by his band (keener to join up with Hereward the Wake) and in his head by conversations with Weland Smith. As the book draws to a close the gap between Buccmaster and his followers grows, particularly when his embrace of the old Gods lead to try to carry out a ritualistic killing on a French knight – we also find out (as do his followers) that after having been expelled by his father for attempting a pagan style bural for his Grandfather, he returned several years later and likely murdered his father and sister in an “accidental” fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book is written in a “shadow tongue” – a version of Olde English updated to be readable but respecting many of the rules of that language. Crucially this adds seeming authenticity to Buccmaster’s first person tale and it’s clear that the constraints of the language force the author to more closely imagine the actual thoughts and attitudes that Buccmaster may hold. This relates to a wider theme which its clear Kingsnorth feels strongly about and which he puts into Buccmaster’s mouth, that the true soul of a country is completely bound up in its land, its farming, its language, its ways and the interactions between those – Buccmaster often states that the foreign ways and names for things which change England for ever, that Christianity is destroying the uniqueness and essence of Englishness (themes similar to the author’s non-fictional polemics around the commercialisation of English town centres and villages).\n",
      "\n",
      "What is perhaps most interesting about it is that Buccmaster himself, despite representing the author’s views, is a self-obsessed and delusional character.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not sure if is self-aware or self-delusional that a character who clearly represents the author’s views is themselves self-delusional.\n",
      "\n",
      "A clue may be that a self-proclaimed English nationalist and follower of traditional pre-Christian English rituals actually lives in the West of Ireland and says he is a Zen Buddhist.\n",

      "Lynn Kurland’s stories have always been a comfort read for me. Handsome, chivalrous heroes matched with independent, caring women, all with the fantasy of travelling through time to find true love. I picked up Stars in Your Eyes excited to once again delve into this world, but I quickly became disillusioned with the story and found no comfort from the read.\n",

      "These used to be my favorite books. I looked forward to the new one every year. But the last few years have been boring. Plot is never developed, storylines recycled, the women are the same person going thru the same situations just with a different name, and never given a reason why the main characters should even want to be together. If she's just writing the stories now because she feels she has to instead of that she wants to, she should just stop or take a break.\n",

      "Love, love, loved this book, but I nearly always do when I read a Lynn Kurland time travel/historical. Imogen's dream was to work in the movies. Not as an actress, but in the making of them. Her current job was to visit the UK in search of unique items for a period movie and acquire them for use. A chance encounter resulted in an invitation to a Scottish castle and the opportunity to investigate their possessions. Only it didn't turn out quite as she expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked Imogen a lot. She has a bit of an inferiority complex when it comes to her family, but she also had the backbone to go after her own dreams rather than fall in with their expectations. I didn't like them at all for the way that they treated her, especially her sister, though her brother went a long way toward redeeming himself at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phillip signed the contracts with Heather's father seven years earlier, supposedly gaining both a bride and a place to call his own until it was time to take over Artane. The problem was that all his attempts to gain entry to the keep and actually marry the wench have been spectacularly unsuccessful (and downright embarrassing). He was finally ready to put his foot down as he arrived at Haemesburgh, only to discover his fiancée missing, a strange woman dangling from the drawbridge, and the keep itself in disarray.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also liked Phillip a lot, though there were a few times I wanted to shake him. He is honorable and chivalrous. As the oldest of Robin's sons, he would eventually inherit Artane, but in the meantime, he wanted a place and purpose of his own. He went about it in a logical and practical way. It was interesting to see his thought processes as he prepared to claim his bride. He had something of a soft spot for his younger relatives, who had no trouble talking their ways into going with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story moved a tad slowly as Imogen and Phillip's separate stories were told but picked up immensely upon Imogen's arrival in the past. She was understandably confused, and it was amusing to see her interact with various people as she tried to figure out what was going on. She certainly didn't sit in a corner and weep and wail, and eventually, she could not deny what was blazingly obvious. That didn't stop her from having frequent conversations with herself over what was happening. Phillip's confusion was even greater. First, he had to deal with what was happening inside Haemesburgh. There were plenty of questions with no answers, including the matter of his missing sword. Then there was Imogen. He was drawn to her in unexpected ways, but she also unsettled him. Her speech was strange, but also familiar. For someone who came from the family he had, he was amazingly unprepared, thanks to deliberately avoiding thinking about or questioning things he had seen and heard over the years. It all came back to bite him when he took Imogen to visit his Uncle Jake (Dreams of Stardust). I ached a little for him then as he learned the truth, and was hurt and angry that he hadn't been trusted with it before, but he had brought it on himself by not pursuing answers earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Imogen decided to take matters into her own hands, the adventure continued. She returned to her own time, determined to find Phillip's sword and return it to him. Her arrival back was not without drama, with her family at the forefront of it. I was a little disappointed in the way she let them steamroller her, especially her sister. Phillip was close on her heels, though he took a different route. He received some unexpected help upon his arrival, and I had to laugh at his predicament. I thought he handled it all quite well, but I think that the support he received made a big difference. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about his experiences. Phillip and Imogen's reunion was well done, but not the end of the story. There were some interesting twists and turns to the search for the sword, and the resolution of the unexpected danger Phillip encountered. I found that I was not surprised by Phillip's opponent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked the development of the relationship between Phillip and Imogen. They are drawn to each other from the beginning. Phillip's desire to protect Imogen was more than his usual chivalry, though it took him a while to realize his true feelings. Imogen was mesmerized by Phillip. She was also very adept at reading him, which enabled her to understand him very quickly. Imogen was also protective of him, which is what sent her off trying to find his sword herself. Though he was a bit of a jerk when he found out about where she was from, he overcame that pretty quickly. I liked seeing them spend some time together just talking and getting to know more about each other. I ached a bit for Imogen as she realized her feelings for Phillip. Because of her lack of confidence in herself, she believed that she wasn't good enough for him. Phillip warmed my heart with the way he overcame her fears.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved seeing various characters from previous books. It's always a pleasure to see Robin of Artane and see his unique ways of supporting his family. I especially enjoyed Phillip's reactions after finding out about the origins of some of his family members, like hearing modern English phrases spoken by his father. Both Stephen and Kendrick assisted Phillip and Imogen, and those scenes were pretty funny. My favorite two secondary characters were Sam and Theo. I truly hope that there will be stories for them in the future. The same for Rose and Jackson, who are an intriguing mix of old and new.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my favorite quotes came as Phillip and Imogen went to visit modern day Artane. Phillip commented on having to pay to visit his own home, whereupon Imogen said \"Life's weird.\" followed by Phillip's \"Damn skippy, 'tis.\" and Imogen \"laughed, because there was nothing like modern mixed with really, really vintage.\"\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This was awfully blah... I really wanted Phillips story...but it felt disjointed and that the characters ended up together because we expected them to. Also, next to Jennifer's consistent crying, weeping, sobbing, tearing up, and leaking eyes, this was my least favorite heroine. She was very passive.\n",

      "The Shadow Throne is the second book in The Shadow Campaign series and it’s really not an exaggeration to say that this is almost a completely different book in comparison to the first book. Where The Thousand Names focused mainly on campaigns and actions, The Shadow Throne centered on a revolution in the city of Vordan; filled with intriguing scheming and politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plot began weeks after the end of the previous book and it’s filled with an abundance of political machinations. Django showed his strength as a writer that actions are not his only strength, he clearly shows us here that his characterizations and plotting are also superb. The only problem I had with the first book was that there are some moments where the action scenes were drawn out for too long without actually focusing on the characters first; this problem vanished completely here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The actions this time occurred only twice, in the middle and the last part of the book and honestly speaking, they’re really short. In fact, I have a feeling that if you’re someone who gave the first book 5 stars rating, this would probably be a weaker book for you. Luckily I’m not of them. I found the changes in storytelling direction essential for the continuation of the series. This doesn’t mean that the actions are poorly written, the siege sections in this book was intense and well-written, I also think the pacing is much better because of the changes and there are only two small moments that bored me a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one thing that definitely excels in comparison to the first book is the characterizations. The female characters in this book are very well written, for everyone who’s looking for great LGBT representation in an adult fantasy, look no further, you’ll get it here. Winter is slowly becoming one of my favorite heroines ever, not yet there but she’s on the way. The new POV character, Raiseinia is another well written, but my favorite of the series so far is actually a non-POV character, Janus. Even Marcus, one of the main POV character, is inferior compared to this enigmatic and calm military genius; I can’t wait to find out more about Janus because there’s so much mystery around this guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mentioned earlier there was two moment that bored me in this book. To say it without any spoilers, there was slightly too much romance for my taste and also, the preparation for the final action sequences in this book was drawn out a bit too long while the climax sections lasted only for 5% of the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Shadow Throne is a different kind of book from its predecessor but for me, it was superior to the last book and highly addictive to read. Depending on the remaining three books, there’s a HIGH chance that The Shadow Campaigns will be included in my lonely list of favorite series of all time. Once again, recommended for fans of flintlock/military fantasy.\n",

      "Writer was generously provided with ARC in exchange for my honest review:\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is comprised of a series of short stories, all of them intertwined on the larger scale. A formal dinner party at Signore Mario Amatore’s restaurant inspires its participants to recall various erotic interludes preceding the event (and allowing us, the readers, to see how everyone is connected in some way). And Holy. Hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These were your run-of-the-mill erotic stories. Sillman writes beautifully, the attention to detail is magnificent, and the way everything is woven together is quite an impressive feat. Not only that, the narratives are so intimate and personal that at times, it felt straight up voyeuristic to be reading this. Additionally, some of the stories are so dark and intense they really require a bit of a break, as another reviewer pointed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a really different read for me when it comes to the erotica genre. The way each story manages to combine eloquent prose and impressively naughty language makes the entire book feel like a peephole, with us, the reader, as the Peeping Tom. Sinfully delicious read!\n",

      "That was hands-down the most erotic book I have ever read.\n",
      "And I read a lot.\n",
      "James Sillwood created a beautiful mosaic of short stories weave together beautifully.\n",
      "Each story carries his own color, flavor and feel. Some are dark and has a sort of film-noir kind of vibe, some are steamy hot, and some are so fragile and gentle that it brings tears to your eyes. But all of them with no exception are extremely erotic, and very well written.\n",
      "It's very tricky to write sex without making it smutty, you need to stimulate the heart and brain of the reader before aiming to the lower parts of his body, having said that many books that I've read misses that and turning out to be written porn.\n",
      "It's even harder to do when you're writing a short story, because than you are limited and have to connect with the reader in not so many words. That is exactly what I felt in this book, it just works magic on you.\n",
      "James is managing to bring you from zero to hundred in a very short time and he never misses. Every reader can find some of his darkest fantasies forming to a story in that book, without any shame or apologies .My personal favorites were the garage scene and the Amazon lady.\n",
      "This book is a piece of art and a must read.\n",
      "Be advised though, that you won't be able to finish it in one go… that book requires pauses to get yourself together .\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is a very well written story and the characters were just amazing and the details were amazingly described. The story just sucks you in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each story has its own magic and they all managed to entertain me until the very end. The erotic scenes are very sensual and exciting to read. It was the first time I read in this genre and the book made me wonder why I have never tried it before. Sillwood managed to keep my on edge through its wit, sexiness, and humor. As a woman, I was pleasantly surprised of how well the women are portrayed by a male writer. I loved it!\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is a big strange erotic novel. It features 23 vignettes about different characters who are linked together by a dinner party at a London restaurant. The vignettes are all erotic encounters and they cover some truly diverse territory. A lot of the sex is very dirty indeed. I was reminded of other literary erotica such as the Story of the Eye (Georges Bataille) and Delta of Venus (Anais Nin).\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a complex and ambitious novel, and it was great to read something so fresh and original. However the novel doesn’t succeed in everything it wants to do. It feels very rough and raw in a few areas. The biggest problem I had was that despite many bridging scenes the book still feels like a collection of short stories rather than a whole novel. We are introduced to new characters in each story and mostly they don’t do much outside of their own story. It’s hard to remember who they all are. Is there going to be some outrageous sex party in the final chapters that will integrate all of the characters? Sadly not. The ending is very abrupt and there’s no climax (surely there should be a huge climax?).\n",
      "\n",
      "There are frequent changes of perspective within chapters. The perspective shifts from character to character and moves between the first and the third person. I felt this made it unnecessarily difficult to follow the story. Another curiosity is that some of the sex scenes end almost as soon as they begin. It’s almost as if they were censored. I found this a little bit unsatisfying in a couple of cases. Other scenes go into extreme pornographic detail. I would have preferred a consistent tone across the entire book.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favourite stories were towards the end of the book. I liked the Belle Charente story, where a young man enters into a dangerous relationship with his uncle’s sexy and slightly mad wife. I also liked the Masquerade story, where a sexy landlady seduces a younger male tenant in exchange for extending the rent. In these stories I cared about the characters and I wasn’t just waiting for the sex to happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "One chapter in particular I found rather unpleasant. In the story Bodywork, a woman apparently unsatisfied with her husband, enters into an encounter with a mechanic. The woman seems to want to degrade herself. The mechanic films her while he penetrates her every orifice, spreads banana yoghurt on her and threatens her with a dog. The mechanic also overcharges her for work on her car. It’s unclear what was motivating this woman. There was no indication that she found the man sexually attractive, and why would she allow herself to be filmed if she wanted to keep the affair a secret? This one was really unsexy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked Amatore’s Restaurant. It is a bold piece of literary erotica. However it probably needs more work in order to be the best it can be.\n",

      "\n",
      "I´ve recently finished the ninth part and I must say that the immense coherency, precision in plotting, and meta context are so fine tuned that it is a joy to read. The effort to polish this until perfection without hardly any logic holes, lengths, and errors and to stay comprehensible must be immense and I must say that I´ve rarely ever seen something like that in Sci-Fi because it´s such a difficult task.\n",
      "\n",
      "That´s how it often goes\n",
      "Mostly, the novels of a series are closed in themselves and there are not so many retrospects and connections because it can get too complicated. Peter F Hamilton, Alastair Reynolds, Banks, and some others come close, but Hamilton is the only one with similar interconnections and great character development.\n",
      "\n",
      "It´s not just that the events, fractions, and happenings of the previous parts are used for reminiscences, the whole power balance, allies, and economic motivations change and keep both the honest, direct war and the hidden, political messes and backstabbings evolving. In such cases I like to imagine the storyboard with context and lines in different colors, metaplots, subplots,… and how complex and interwoven it must be for the creators standing in front and, while writing, in their work and expanding it, pun intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that makes sci fi great in one package\n",
      "And there is everything, the war, supersoldiers, rebel fractions, big questions about the alien technology, mixed quantum fantasy elements, the highly recommended function of putting the name of the character whose POV is described in front of each chapter to get quicker and directer suspense without the need of explaining where we are, extreme attention on the detailed and realistic description of ship design, physics, life in space,... perfect balance of technobabble, harmless infodumps, tons of tropes, credible characters who are great for constructing inner and outer conflicts, unbelievable worldbuilding, sense of wonder en masse, just everything is done completely right to write one of the greatest space operas ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "One doesn´t have to be a sci fi nerd to enjoy it\n",
      "Even people who aren´t so in Sci-Fi can read it just because of the characters, like someone who reads Game of Thrones because of an interest in the protagonists and not because of medieval times, magic, and stuff. I think that sci-fi needed something like that, away from the, for an average audience, too complex hard sci-fi, the too slow and less explosive social sci-fi, too indodumpy and tech-focused cyberpunk, and the general very long and complex novels of many other authors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Side by side together on the legendary shelve\n",
      "One of the reasons why this series is so great may lie in the cooperation of the authors, that the weaknesses, if there are any, of the one can be compensated by the other and that everyone writes the stuff he is best at. This practice could get interesting in the future, not just with more and more collaborations to produce high-quality content, but with collaborative writing in a fictional social cataloging network, let´s call it goodbook. Whose inhabitants could, with the help of the book adaptability quote, become professional at escalating the whole thing very quickly, because the knowledge and experience of thousands of readers of specific genres are immense and the one or other might have already played with the thought of writing something, but has problems with the plot or the characters or the twists or… is just a lazy as heck procrastinating slacker.

Personally, I would avoid direct sunlight, drill deep inside asteroids, dwarf planets, or planets and build underground farming complexes, avoiding most dangers this way and focusing on a mix of bioreactors and farming, to have 2 independent food production lines in case of catastrophes.\n",

      "Avasarala is finally here!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike Leviathan Wakes, I’m venturing into uncharted territory within the series for the first time here. By that, I meant that I haven’t watched any part of Caliban’s War, the second book in The Expanse series by James S. A. Corey duo, in the television series adaptation except for some episodes consisting of Avasarala and Bobbie. is a superior book compared to in every aspect. This is caused mostly by Corey’s decision to expand—pun intended, get used to this—the number of POV characters from two to four characters. This ended up being a terrific narrative decision. The distinction in character’s voices and personality allows the duo to display their strength as an author further as they tightened the pacing and the plot through several more different character’s perspectives rather than being constricted merely to Holden and Miller’s like before. Although I did love Holden and Miller, there were several chapters in the first book where their narrative felt like indistinguishable; it was like they’re the exact same character in a different situation. This kind of situation doesn’t happen at all in .\n",
      "\n",
      "The three completely new POV characters being introduced here were highly entertaining in their own way. Firstly, we have Prax, a scientist searching for his beloved daughter—Mei—in the war-torn Ganymede. Secondly, we have Bobbie, a Martian marine who watches her entire platoon slaughtered by an inexplicably monstrous supersoldier, and now she seeks revenge and revelations. Finally, we have Avasarala, a witty and foul-mouthed politician struggling to prevent an intergalactic war from reoccurring. Obviously, Holden and the crew of Rocinante are back again with their adventures, and they eventually find their fates being connected with all of the new character’s storylines. The increase in the number of POV characters brings balance in emotion and pacing to the narrative; the themes of responsibility, family, redemption, and love were dealt with care through the eyes of these characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I know I’m only two books into the series so far, and there are still seven more books for me to read before I’m done with it, but the characters are truly the heart of the narrative. The characterizations for all of the characters were wonderful. And I can’t emphasize how much I loved Chrisjen Avasarala. What a freaking badass grandma; we should all bow down to her. Avasarala has appeared in the TV series since the first season; I was disappointed to find that she didn’t appear yet in the first book. But wow, I didn’t expect that Avasarala in the book would cuss more fatally.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was incredibly entertaining to witness her cunning and cussing in actions; it reminded me of reading series by Scott Lynch. However, that’s not the only good part of her story. Avasarala is talented at politics but she’s not all-mighty, she does have a weakness in her, and I think this is what makes her a better character to root for; her greatness that she allowed the public to see is a part of her “mask”. I also loved Avasarala’s and Arjun’s relationship. It’s highly refreshing to read a mature relationship that’s not infuriating to read sometimes. Both Avasarala and Arjun has gone through years of marriage; they could perceive, understand, and comfort each other through facial expressions, gesture, or a few words. All of these praises doesn’t apply exclusively to Avasarala; Holden, Bobbie, Prax, and the side characters do have their own moments to shine. This kind of personalization and relationship building is what Corey does well as an author.\n",

Although Corey’s prose isn’t particularly memorable per se, it truly gets the job of telling an accessibly entertaining story filled with great characters operating in an expansive universe done.

A young girl is kidnapped for nefarious biological purposes, and her father, Praxidike Meng, will do anything to get her back.

When they intersect with Jim Holden and his crew on the Rocinante, sparks really start to fly. Bobbi is about 150% of the size of a normal woman.

      "One big thing that stands out to me going back to this after reading all the available books in the series is that my complaint about distinct bad guys not getting introduced until very late in the stories was addressed. From this point on we almost always have a face of the threat through most of the action, and that’s an improvement that made a great series even better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also wanted to check this out again after seeing the second season of the TV series. The show has gotten so good that I’m now visualizing all the characters as the actors who play them while reading. There’s also an interesting dynamic in that that the two-headed writer who makes up the James SA Corey name also works on the show, and since they have the advantage of knowing what’s going to happen for the next several books it’s able to shade in lot of character nuance and motivations that were just a little thin and simplistic in the early going.\n",

      "Humanity has expanded throughout our solar system, colonizing Mars and various moons and asteroids. Since people are always gonna be people, and will therefore suck, political tensions are high between Earth, Mars, and the Belters, and the events of the first book in the series have the threat of war seeming higher than ever. And just like in Westeros everyone is so consumed with their petty scheming and power plays that they’re ignoring the much larger threat that is growing under their noses. So it falls to a crew of misfits running their own ship for profit to step in when the shit hits the air recyclers.\n",
      "\n",
      "This on-going space opera has sucked me in to its world...er… solar system completely with its spaceships, action, politics, and weird sci-fi elements mixed with just enough humor and emotional weight to give it some heft beyond its pew!-pew! appeal. The characters are well drawn even if they aren’t particularly deep, and their motivations are plainly spelled out in their dialogue. So this is all text, no subtext, but it is entertaining. I particularly liked the new character of Chrisjen Avasarala, a grandmother and UN official from Earth whose little old lady appearance is subverted by her foul mouth and political cunning.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the series so far has suffered a bit from not giving us any perspective from the vast conspiracy that is causing so much of the trouble. Granted, some of this has been played as a mystery to solve, but for two books now we’ve gotten no sense of who the bad guys are or what they're planning other than what’s been figured out by the heroes. Both books have finally revealed a kind of mid-level mastermind character near the end, and in both cases these have been full on mustache twirling villains so the threat they pose seems kind of vague and cartoonish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, this one ends on a helluva twist that has me itching to roll right into the next one, and I couldn’t turn the pages fast enough when I was in the midst of this. I’ll be happily returning to the Expanse series as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus, this for the show coming to SyFy based on the series has got me even more excited.\n",

      "This is definitely a thought-provoking book. My real problem with it was, in many ways, a collection of anecdotes rather than a survey of scientific work and suggestion of ideas on a larger level. Most people do not want to think about pee, let alone collect their own and put it on the compost heap. They will, however, happily pee into their school urinal, knowing the urine collected will later be collected to fertilize the school orchard. I think the book did not tackle this dilemma head on. The attitude seemed to be that if people just learned enough about urine, they would change their ways. I do not think that is true.\n",

      "“It is entirely possible for wise and educated persons to disagree about points of fact. But facts are stubborn things.

The happiness of the people is the aim of any good government.\n",

It’s like Wheeler knew we were going to need great political quotes like this. Or maybe because a lot of has a lot to do with politics, but I like the premonition to reality storyline more.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, despite how easily I find great quotes within the series, I’m still not completely won over. While I do appreciate plots that don’t rely on straight action to keep an audience entertained, since most things in life don’t work out with a fight and those that do don’t end well, I felt like was dragged down a bit by the politics. Maia had some experience in peace-keeping and politics before her banishment, but she still had a long way to go to being a perfect ruler. This was an understandable struggle that Maia would encounter and I was curious to see how she would progress. Unfortunately, Maia didn’t actually seem to have that hard of a time ruling, it was just the fact that others didn’t want her to.\n",

      "In every decision that Maia has to make as a ruler, there always seemed to be the choice, and she of course always chose wisely (cue knight from ). While some people were unhappy about it, they were always the or people. There was no gray area, no doubt or uncertainty. I understand that part of being one with the Medium means not having any doubt of your choices (because the Medium will guide you), but as I said in my review of the second installment, a puny, imperfect mortal like myself has a hard time relating to that situation. Any kind of doubt or insecurity that Maia experiences only seems to appear so we’ll remember that she’s supposed to be a real human, but then quickly returns to the perfect other-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only time I felt like Maia seemed like a real person with true emotions was when Collier was involved. , I can have some serious swooning going on over Collier. Except, guess what? Once again, now that I actually enjoy him and don’t hate him, where is he? . Always a book-maid, never a book-bride.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ending was definitely the most disappointing for me. It was so . Compared to everything she experienced in her entire life, this was probably the easiest, even though this book should’ve been one of the most difficult. Even with her faith in the Medium, she had bigger fish to fry (forgive?), but the fish ended up being tiny minnows that she set free. (Not that I’m saying they should’ve been killed, it was just . Don’t take my word for it though, Maia admits it herself:\n",

      "I don’t want to give away the ending and I know that this seems like I’m pulling a random quote from anywhere in the book, but this happens at 91% right at the end. I have a hard time finding book fulfillment when even the protagonist thinks that the task is easy. You could say that I’m taking her too literally and maybe she was being sarcastic. Except that she goes and does this task within a couple percentages of the book and does less than snap her fingers to accomplish it. Also, despite all this trash talk from Corriveaux, the main antagonist, we never really get a one-on-one stand-off between him and Maia.\n",
      "Huzzah? The entire ending deserves maybe one cheer.\n",

      "Honestly, I thought\n",
      "I was waiting for it from the first book, and while I was disappointed that I was wrong, I will also give Wheeler credit for not falling into my original expectations. That doesn’t necessarily mean that what actually happened was more interesting.\n",

      "A lot of the lack-luster action and tension in in my opinion was saved by the kishion. Hoooooly buckets, what an interesting character. Ever since his re-return in , I was looking forward to seeing more of him. Talk about a conflicted character, and yet he was one of my favorites. I’ve noticed a pattern that most of my favorite characters in this series (Collier and the kishion) are more complicated, which shouldn’t be all that surprising, because these types of characters are more interesting and more human. While Maia is a conundrum because of her deep faith and goodness despite her suffering, she comes out looking more like a faultless goddess that I can never relate to or aspire to be.\n",

      "I've read a couple of Tom Shone's biographies/retrospectives, and I am a big fan of how he approaches each director's work. A lot of these types of coffee table director books spend a large portion of their bulk describing the plot to the movies, down to excruciating detail, whereas Shone does not. He only goes into such details if themes and moments relate back to specific moments from Scorsese's life. It's a good combination of behind-the-scenes info and critic that makes you want to revisit every one of Marty's works. I've got a list of 7+ movies to watch after finishing this book, and I had the pleasure of experiencing a few of his works for the first time (After Hours and The Color of Money especially impressed me - the zaniness of AH and the shots/editing of TCoM had me giddy like a college freshman at film school).\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a good read and it's also shocking how many of Marty's movies underperformed at the box office.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Interesting and inspiring, with an in-depth look at every movie so far. Now I only hope that he will write his own biography sometime, I bet that would be even better.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I will admit I'm often more of an admirer of Martin Scorsese for his dedication to film preservation and educating us of the genius of cinema than I am of the many movies he has made during his famous career. Of the 23 films covered in this massive volume, only a few I would list as in my excellent list (\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\"/ \"Taxi Driver\"/ \"The King of Comedy\" and the superlative \"Goodfellas\"); some I admire more than liking (\"Mean Streets\"/ \"Raging Bull\"/ \"The Departed\") and at the other end, a few clunkers (\"Cape Fear\"/ \"Casino\"/ \"Shutter Island\").\n",
      "\n",
      "With that said, as a film lover and student of the cinema I cannot be anything but exhilarated by this top-notch retrospective of the career and effervescent personality of Marty. This book is worth having just for the oodles of terrific photos from Scorsese films but even more so for the fascinating array of behind the scenes and candid shots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very much liked the coverage of Scorsese's \"Little Italy\" background and his early films and author Tom Shone has written an easy to read, excellent text.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did have a grumble with the discussion of Elmer Bernstein's music for \"Cape Fear\" which neglected to note that Mr. Bernstein only adapted and arranged the original Bernard Herrmann score from the 1962 (and much superior) film version - a fact that was clearly acknowledged by all during production and when the soundtrack was released.\n",

      "I had trouble deciding between giving this book four or five stars, but decided that if I had to think about it that much I shouldn't give it five.\n",
      "The thing is, I can't quite articulate what was uncomfortable in this read, only that it was present. Perhaps part of it was that the book wasn't what I expected. I thought I would read something on using story for healing, which it was, but it was presented by telling stories and how they were applied to the person. I found the back and forth nature of those passages (a bit of story, a bit of conversation, a bit of story) jolting and hard to follow. I also had trouble connecting some of the stories to the person in question, which made it somewhat hard to follow. I couldn't seem to see the commonalities the author seemed to think were obvious. He also used a fair amount of Disney stories (sometimes not knowing that the Disney story is offensive to some people in their tradition, such as the Mulan example). There's nothing wrong with that, it just felt uncomfortable for some reason- I think mostly because I have a tendency to pull away from mainstream culture stories. He made a good point for using mainstream cultural stories, though.\n",
      "There were also connections I didn't make until the last chapter or two, which would have helped. He mentions, for instance, that he uses ceremony to create a slightly altered state before the story telling, but I didn't realize he was hypnotizing his clients before telling the story until the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 'problem,' if there is one, is probably me. I just still have trouble giving it five stars with my full heart.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A worthwhile dive into \"alternative mental health\" as I like to call it, recognizing that the stories we tell ourselves ultimately determine our very existence. We can allow stories to label or liberate. My greatest \"a-ha!\" was when he talked about healing stories versus sickness stories. I realized that the traumatic stories I have from my own life will, upon every retelling, promote more trauma in others and myself. But, the moment I heal from my trauma, I can then share those same stories, and it promotes healing instead. The stories themselves are generally the same, but based on the healing work I've done as the teller determines whether or not I'm sharing trauma or healing with the rest of the world. I'll never forget that.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is a book that spoke to my soul and my passion for stories. Lewis Mehl-Madrona is a physician who has come to use stories and his traditional culture in conjunction with Western medicine to help people heal themselves. Finding a story that speaks to you and your current struggle can be a catalyst for healing. Ceremony is also important to making a transition from one way of being to another. I've been telling the story of Raven stealing (back) the sun and the moon since reading this book. For now at least it is my transformation story.\n",

      "There seem to be a lot of different people who have many different opinions about this book, whether or not it was \"officially authorized\", whether certain parts of his life were discussed or not, or shouldn't have been... I honestly don't know and don't care. All of those comments seemed to be more of a battle of the uber-fans. I am sure there are better books, and worse books, out there covering the life of Robert Downey Jr, but I found this one to be just the right length.\n",
      "\n",
      "For me, personally, I knew who Robert Downey Jr was and had seen him in a few movies back in the '80s (like \"Weird Science\") and they were okay or not, but I didn't think anything special about the movies or about him\n",
      "... and then came \"Iron Man\"!\n",
      "And I'm sure I'm not the only one who started actually taking notice of Robert Downey Jr again--or for the first time, really. So, I saw a few of his other movies like \"Chaplin\", \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\", \"The Singing Detective\", \"Sherlock Holmes\" and \"Tropic Thunder\" and found that I did, in fact, enjoy many of his latter movies.\n",
      "But I also sort of recalled him having some major drug issues or something, so I decided to read this book and see what was what.\n",
      "And, all I can say, is that with all of the drug dependencies and the several years of incarcerations, and other issues in his personal life (as well as some horrible movies--*not* like the ones I listed above) to the changes I have now seen throughout all the Avenger Movies up to\"End Game\", I can say that he has truly come a helluva long way.\n",

      "I'm a super big fan of Robert Downey, Jr., but this wasn't the greatest book. It's obviously not an authorized bio, because it's evident that the writer gathered all of his information from other written sources.

      "Researchers believe that \"The Buddha\" ( a term meaning \"The Awakened One\" ) was an actual man named Siddhartha Gautama that lived in India over 2,600 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "His teachings were passed down for several centuries after his death via an oral tradition until they were written down on collections of palm leaves. These are stored in the Sutta Pitaka of the Pali Canon, the texts of the oldest surviving form of Buddhism known as Theravada. The Sutta Pitaka consists of 5 \"Nikayas\" or books/collections.\n",
      "\n",
      "These collection are thousands of pages long, contain much repetitive content and have only been translated into English as of the 19th century. Translations into English are still being perfected as ancient Pali and modern English are extremely different languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, the reader who wants to read the Buddhist message for him/herself has the daunting task of combing through several large, expensive, repetitious volumes of translations that may not be clear to a modern reader.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon\" is an anthology of the Buddha's teachings compiled by Bhikkhu Bodhi. Bhikkhu Bodhi was born in New York City in 1944 as Jeffrey Block. He is an American Theravada Buddhist monk. Bhikkhu Bodhi has translated large portions of the Pali Canon himself and is a native English speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "His goal in compiling his anthology is to make the Buddha's message more accessible to the ordinary person and to encourage the ordinary person to read the Pali Canon themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this end, he has chosen what he thinks are the most essential of the Buddha's discourses. Bhikkhu Bodhi has also put these suttas ( discourses from the Buddha ) into a logical order by subject in his anthology -- something which doesn't exist in the Pali Canon, which is a scattered, repetitious collection of separate talks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bhikkhu Bodhi further aids the reader by reducing the repetition of phrases in the translations ( left over from the oral tradition ) and Bhikkhu Bodhi introduces each section with some extremely helpful essays on the suttas that follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result is an easy to understand, scholarly anthology that gives the reader a sense of what can be found in the Sutta Pitaka in regards to the essentials of the Buddha's message - without having to make the larger investment of going through the significantly more voluminous, repetitious and expensive English translations of these collections.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book will likely not be enjoyable to people whose exposure to Buddhism has been a mixture of inspirational poetry, psychological analysis and elements borrowed from other spiritual traditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "People who are uncomfortable reading text that is more \"religious\" will find those elements in this collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bhikkhu Bodhi has striven to given an honest snap shot of what someone can expect to find in translations of the Pali Canon. That snap shot includes the presence of preternatural beings, mythical realms and what is commonly known in the West as \"reincarnation\". If you have limited tolerance for reading such things, this book isn't for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book can also be dry in many sections. It isn't a book that can be read, or understood by reading through it in many large chunks while laying on a couch after a taxing day. My recommendation would be to read it a tiny bit at a time, sitting up and during your best hours to get the most out of it.\n",

      "I was surprised to see that a copies of the \"The Peg\" (Ani Sutta, Samyutta Nikaya XX.7), \"The Unconjecturable\" (Acintita Sutta, Anguttara Nikaya IV.77) and \"To Sivaka\" (Moliyasivaka Sutta, Samyutta Nikaya XXXVI.21) suttas (discourses from the Buddha ) were not included in this anthology.\n",
      "\n",
      "These suttas state that the Buddha knew his teachings would get distorted over time, that the\n",
      "Buddha believed that ordinary people could not explain the details of their current situation by tracing their karma ( kamma ) and that not all situations a person encounters in their lives are the result of karma. These are extremely important ideas and it is a bit strange that they are not included in an anthology of essential teachings attributed to the Buddha himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "As stated previously, a big problem for those seeking to understand Buddhism directly from the original texts is that these texts haven't been translated very well into English. English and Pali are just very different languages. The modern world is also very different from the ancient world from where the texts came.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that Bhikkhu Bodhi is an American and a native English speaker I had different expectations for these translations than what I read.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example, throughout the anthology the root causes of \"suffering\" are listed as being \"greed, hatred and delusion\". The terms in quotes are not the only possible English translations. The English translations are technically correct, but I believe the terms used hold extreme connotations to the contemporary English speaker which rob the Buddhist message of its meaning and relevance to contemporary life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people interpret \"suffering\" as agony, \"greed\" as extreme desire, \"hatred\" as an extremely strong emotion and \"delusion\" as close to being insane. Other translators have stated that the Pali word \"dukha\", commonly translated as \"suffering\" really refers to any dissatisfactory feeling from a vague sense of things not being the best as they could be on one end, to flat out agony on the other end.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, an alternate translation like this one is possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The root cause of feelings of unhappiness, distress or suffering come from desire, aversion or being ignorant to the nature of life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, that speaks to me much more as a modern person and seems relevant to many more of my experiences than:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The roots of suffering are greed, hatred and delusion\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The alternative translation doesn't come off as a recycled puritanism of which I want no part of as a secular person.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a number of other examples of alternative translations like this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not a scholar of any kind and Bhikkhu Bodhi is. As an expert who has devoted his life to Buddhism I wouldn't be surprised to learn Bhikkhu Bodhi is correct in his translation choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm just saying my preference would have been for the other choices and I think that will be true for many people interested in this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe this book to be a first of its kind in what does and how well it does it. I heartily encourage anyone with an interest in Buddhism to endure the shortcomings of the book. Read it in little bits every day, read the whole thing and talk to people about it. Such an investment will keep coming back to you for the rest of your life.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "So, reviewing and assigning stars to the words of the Buddha, is kind of like pronouncing judgement on the prophecies of Christ, Moses, or Muhammad. It's a bit presumptuous. However, I'm not really evaluating the Buddha's thoughts, per se (that would take a lot longer to do than I have available here), but rather this book, including the translation and selection of these words by Bhikkhu Bodhi (an American Buddhist monk). In fact, in front of each section, there is a bit of commentary and explanation by Bodhi himself, partly to explain some of the content, and partly also to explain his choices in translation.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a lot of tricky choices, here, for a translator. First, these were handed down in an oral tradition for centuries before they were ever written down, so (like much else that was preserved orally) there is a LOT of repetition. How much of this to preserve, and how much to elide?\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, there are terms like \"karma\", which has entered the English language but with not exactly the same meaning as the Buddha intended when he used that word. There are also words, like \"dukkha\", whose traditional translation of \"suffering\" is, to say the least, debatable. Bodhi chooses a fairly traditional route in the choices he makes, but he does a cogent and coherent job of explaining what those choices were.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, there are a lot of metaphors here which were clearly aimed at people living in a different technological era. An analogy that helps someone living in the 5th century B.C. to understand, may obscure more than it explains to a 21st century reader. One could, in theory, have justified a \"translation\" that substituted analogies with smartphones and automobiles and social networks, but (thankfully?) Bodhi does not do this. He does, however, do a decent job of explaining to us what the metaphors and analogies were intended to explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is, perhaps obviously but I'll point it out anyway, not necessarily a read-it-in-one-go kind of book. I put it by the bed, reading it a few pages most nights, which makes me a literal \"bedside table buddhist\". It could probably have done as well as a first-thing-when-you-wake-up book. Each piece was interesting to read, and think about, and try to decipher and decrypt. It seems to be part of the nature of the Buddha's thought that it is not instantly approachable; it requires you to think for a while on each bit before you get anywhere, because it is not intended to be just intellectual understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, one has to wonder how similar any of this was to what the historical figure now known as the Buddha, actually said. The language used in conversations between himself and his followers and questioners, cannot be a remotely accurate reflection of how the original conversations went. It is rather like hearing a folk tale, and trying to imagine what the original story was. The monks who passed it down, generation after generation, may have been extraordinarily diligent and faithful, and still the sheer quantity of time (something like 120 generations) would make it implausible that it has not changed at least a little. But perhaps, like DNA which mutates much more in the non-coding sections than the ones which encode fundamental metabolic reactions, the essence of his thought might be there. It is fun to think about.\n",
      "\n",
      "You could spend lifetimes doing it.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "So far, I'm having a really really hard time with this book. Each chapter is set up with the author/editor telling you HIS interpretation of the sutras and then finally giving you the sutras at the end of the chapter. Which seems a totally bass-aackward way of doing it, because you don't have a clue what the hell he's talking about most of the time (unless you want to flip back and forth in the book).\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing that really bothers me about the book is the dogmatic view on cosmology. I know, it's because I'm a westerner who has some pretty serious hangups when it comes to cosmological dogmas. I haven't decided what I believe about past lives and what happens after death, because that is SO unknowable. And unprovable theories about life after death is one of the things I think is utter bullshit about western religions, so I'm not particularly open to more theories on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yes, I realize this is one of many reasons why Buddhism is taught so entirely differently in the west than it is in the east.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way I feel myself reacting to this book is the same feeing of retreat and shutting down that I get when faced with Judeo-Christian viewpoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess the only way to put it is that this isn't 'my Buddhism.' And this is highly likely to be one of those books that I never finish.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is the most recent of several Pali-only anthologies of Buddhist texts I've read, the other two being Word of the Buddha and Path To Deliverance, both by the famous German monk Nyanatiloka. (The latter is especially good.) This one is easily the most comprehensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those of you who find the suttas tough going on account of their lack of thematic organization, this book will be a godsend. As Bhikkhu Bodhi explains in the introduction, the idea for it had its genesis in a series of lectures he gave on the Majjhima Nikaya. His goal therein was to arrange materials from simplest to most profound, giving a progressive, graded course of theoretical and practical instruction. He then decided to turn that approach to the Sutta Pitaka as a whole. The result is the present work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The specifics of this structure are as follows, where each number refers to a part of the book:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.The Buddha's description of the human condition\n",
      "2.The nature of the Buddha and his attainment\n",
      "3.How to approach the Dhamma\n",
      "4.How the Dhamma contributes to happiness in this life\n",
      "5.How it can contribute to happiness in future rebirths\n",
      "6.The Dhamma on why renunciation is the safest course to take (the perils of samsara)\n",
      "7.The nature of the path to liberation\n",
      "8.How to master the mind\n",
      "9.The nature of transcendent wisdom\n",
      "10.Stages of realization\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these sections is prefaced with a substantial introduction by Bhikkhu Bodhi, and some of these are surprisingly good. (I have often felt a little sour toward BB's writing because he is such a slave to the Commentaries and tends to express himself with a slightly stilted, pompous air.) I was especially impressed by his introduction to part 3 (\"Approaching the Dhamma\"), which is, in effect, an essay on the place and nature of faith (saddha) in the Buddha's teaching. I think anyone, no matter how knowledgeable, can benefit from these pages (81ff). It is especially useful as a contrast to Christian notions of faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "So who would benefit most from this book? I think beginning students would especially be served by it, or at least those who have until now subsisted mainly on a diet of secondary texts and haven't yet plunged into the jungle of the suttas. This book is excellent for providing an orientation, and if read two or three times so that one really becomes familiar with the passages contained therein, when the passages are finally encountered in their full form it should prove very rewarding. But then, anyone who wants a refresher, or a different manner of presentation from, say, the four noble truths and the three-fold training (sila, samadhi, pañña), will also benefit.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I pick this book up again and again. It's just the end all book on Buddhism for me (if there could be an end all book). There's so much in here, you could spend a lifetime studying this one book. I heard Bhikkhu Bodhi speak last year, and he seemed so quiet and easygoing, such an unassuming man. But what a scholar. That an American monk has written such a definitive book on Buddhism is fantastic (Although I suppose a lot is translation, not commentary). I will never tire of this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've read several reviews that said this book is excellent for beginners. I would disagree. I would not consider myself a beginner (no more than we ALL are beginners, just to go a little Zen on you) and this book is difficult. Easy to read, but heavy stuff and challenging concepts. There are many better books for the beginner.\n",

It is amazing that I can forget the entire plot of a book that I have read in just a few years but apparently I can so I almost felt like I was reading this book for the first time. Once I started listening to this book, I didn't want to stop because I was really curious about how things would work out. I am so glad that I decided to revisit this series in audio.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the second book in the Black Blade series which really should be read in order since this book builds on the events from the previous installment. There are a lot of things going on and Lila, Devon, Felix, and the rest of the characters are keeping their eyes open for anyone looking to harm the Sinclair Family. The annual tournament that the families participate in is about to begin and Lila is chosen to participate and represent the Sinclair Family. Of course, there are few other things going on that they will need to deal with while the tournament plays out.\n",

      "I grew to like the characters even more with this book. I have really enjoyed learning more about the characters and there were some pretty big revelations in this book. While I didn't remember what really happened in the story, I did find that there was one character that I never fully trusted so I did wonder if I might have subconsciously known that this character wasn't what they appeared to be. I found the story to be really exciting and the mystery did keep me guessing.\n",

This book really has a lot going for it and the world that it is set in is amazing. I just love the combination of magic, monsters, and the mob that this world is built upon. This book picks up right where the first book in the series, , leaves off so I would recommend that this series be read in order.\n",

      "Lila has assumed her role as bodyguard to the Sinclair family bruiser, Devon. It is time for the annual Tournament of Blades competition. This competition will consist of selected members from each family facing off against each other until the champion is named. Lila doesn't know a whole lot about this tournament from her prior life as a thief but she may be the Sinclair family's best chance at winning. When some unusual things start happening, Lila works to try to find out what is going on through the use of her magic and the skills that she has developed from her work as a thief.\n",

Some of the characters from the other families are actually pretty interesting and others are just ugly to their core. The action during the tournament was exciting but not quite as exciting as the action that occurred outside of the tournament. There were a few twists and turns in this story which I really loved. Lila had grown as a character and seems a bit more sure of herself as she learns more about her parents' past.\n",

      "The only thing that bothered me about this book was the romantic pieces. I know that this is a YA novel and I am just an old lady but the romance felt so very young and was distracting at times. I do appreciate that the story is not centered on a love triangle but Lila's indecision regarding her feelings for Devon are becoming old. I kind of wanted to slap her so that she would either act on her feelings or stop thinking about it. I am hoping that the next installment will have some forward momentum in terms of their relationship even if it means that they don't have one...I just want someone to make a decision and quit talking about it.\n",

      "Final review, first posted on Fantasy Literature:\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: some spoilers for the first book, Cold Burn of Magic.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Dark Heart of Magic, the second book in Jennifer Estep’s BLACK BLADE teen urban fantasy series, the adventures of seventeen year old Lila Merriweather ― orphan, ex-homeless person and pickpocket, current bodyguard, and swordfighter extraordinaire ― continue. In a world that contains both normal mortals and magicks, humans endowed with different magical powers, Lila has two extraordinary powers: soulsight, which enables her to read the emotions of another person by looking into their eyes, and transference, the ability to mirror another person’s magical powers that are being used against her. This makes Lila a particularly valued bodyguard for the Sinclair Family, one of the most powerful magical families in the town of Cloudburst Falls, which has unusually high levels of magical activity ― so much that it’s become a tourist hotspot for people who want to see pixies, monsters, trolls and other magical creatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lila intends to serve out a year-long term with the Sinclair Family and then leave town, despite the “soulful green eyes, teasing grin, and rocking body” of Devon Sinclair, the son and heir of the head of the Sinclair Family. Devon is a caring, kind person who wants to pursue a relationship with Lila, but because of her plans not to hang around long-term and her unwillingness to allow anyone to get too close to her and possibly hurt her, Lila keeps pushing Devon away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lila gets roped by the head of the Sinclair Family into taking part in the annual Tournament of Blades, a sword-fighting competition with over a hundred competitors. The competitors also include her friend Devon, Deah Draconi (daughter of the arch-rival Draconi clan and past champion of the Tournament), Deah’s nasty brother Blake, and Katia Volkov, a gorgeous redhead with designs on Devon’s best friend Felix … who’s no longer interested in Katia because he’s now involved in a Romeo-and-Juliet type of secret relationship with Deah Draconi. Winning the Tournament will bring honor and accolades, as well as a cash prize, but Lila would really prefer to avoid attention, particularly from the nefarious Victor Draconi and his son Blake, who killed Lila’s mother years ago and whom Lila now suspects of planning to take down the other magical Families and take control of Cloudburst Falls.\n",
      "\n",
      "What with sneaking into the Draconi mansion to discover Victor’s plans, trying to figure out who is killing all of the tree trolls in town, and pining after Devon, Lila has a lot distracting her from the Tournament. Not that Lila really cares about the Tournament, at least at first, but when an unknown person sabotages the obstacle course that’s the first round of the competition, gravely endangering Lila and others, Lila starts to think it might be worth trying to win the Tournament.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between the competition, the murdered tree troll mystery, Draconi skullduggery, another mystery about Lila’s family and past, and the obligatory love interest, there’s a lot going on in Dark Heart of Magic. The quick pace and multiple plotlines help to make up for some superficiality. Lila, who has a young and frequently snarky voice, narrates the story. I didn’t find the constant sniping of Lila and some of the other characters particularly witty, so it got tedious for me, but younger readers might disagree. The characters, other than Lila and the hidden villain, are strictly one-dimensional. Even the secret villain is fairly easy to spot, given a couple of rather obvious clues that Estep leaves in the text.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the main character, Lila has some greater depth, particularly as she attempts to come to terms with her painful past and determine what she really wants in life. But, as often happens in fantasy novels, Lila’s skills are over the top, between her super-special magical powers, amazing sword-fighting ability, and expert skills at spying, pickpocketing and lock-picking. In fact, she’s extraordinarily good at pretty much everything except interpersonal relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, is a light and fun read, if you don’t mind some murder and mayhem. I’d recommend this to a teenager who likes fast-paced fantasy adventures with a dash of humor, but isn’t looking for anything really deep or complex. If you enjoyed , the first book in this series, you’ll probably like this one just as well.\n",

      "Reviewed by: Rabid Reads.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tournament of Blades was the driving force behind DARK HEART OF MAGIC which was perfect because what better way to go full throttle on the action than with lots of fighting while also fleshing out all of the pertinent characters’ strengths and weaknesses by putting all of the Cloudburst Falls Families on display. Lila’s no longer a team of one, things are moving along with Devon, and Victor is THE villain to beat. Game. Set. Match.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the previous installment which was a little of both, this novel was centered around the mafia-style plotting rather than the monsters and magicks that comprise Jennifer Estep’s BLACK BLADE universe. I enjoyed the scheming a great deal; this author certainly excels at whodunnit story telling, and Talents were vital, but I did find myself longing for more of the world-building that was so strong in book 1, tree trolls notwithstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seleste was a welcomed addition to this trilogy’s cast, and Deah continued to surprise me at every turn. I was kind of disappointed with how Felix dealt with his love life dilemma, and Vance & Blake were just stupid bullies. The Tournament of Blades ended up being an excellent equalizer, and I liked that most of the baddies got their due. Well, except for Victor, but that’s what BRIGHT BLAZE OF MAGIC IS FOR—right?\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m happy with the way Devon & Lila’s romance has progressed thus far; there’s no triangle which is a BIG plus in Young Adult, next to zero drama, and they are in an optimal spot going into the conclusion. I loved that Sinclair was a genuinely good guy, and that he won Merriweather over by simply being himself. The soulsight sessions between the two of them packed one heck of an emotional punch, and the last few pages definitely pulled on my heartstrings.\n",

      "==============\n",

Add in her unique talent of making something over used, completely new and fresh, not to mention plots that are every bit as fast paced as they are addicting, and you truly have a read that stands out and is every bit as entertaining as those of us that are familiar with Estep's work, have come to expect from her.\n",

Lo disfruté de principio a fin.\n",

      "This volume was published in 1957, it was one of the original Vision Books for Young Readers, and is now republished by Ignatius press. It is one of three in the original series written by de Wohl. He has written these and several other biographies of saints. I wrote an overview of the Vision Books Series and after finding out so much about the series I am thankful that Ignatius has so many of them still in print, and recently heard there are several new volumes in the book. I jumped this on to the top of my list to bead because my youngest daughter is thinking about Saint Jon as her confirmation saint. I already had the eBook and picked up a physical copy of this book for her to read. I am thankful there is an eBook edition of this as I prefer eBooks because of my dyslexia, and my son prefers them because of eye tracking issues. But back to this specific volume:\n",
      "\n",
      "The description of this volume is:\n",
      "\n",
      "“This volume in the Vision Books series of saints for youth combines a world famous Catholic novelist, Louis de Wohl, with one of the most thrilling and dramatic saint's lives in history, St. Joan of Arc. De Wohl uses his famed narrative skill to tell young people about the brave teenage French girl who had visions and led armies in battle, but also about how her entire life testifies to the amazing power of God's grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's all here: how Joan, a humble maiden in an insignificant town, was told by St. Michael the Archangel, St. Catherine, and St. Margaret to lead the French in battle against the English; how she finally succeeded in convincing the French of the truth of her mission; how she met with fantastic success but was betrayed, captured, and imprisoned; and finally, how she suffered through a politically motivated trial for heresy and was burned at the stake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best of all, de Wohl is not interested solely in the external details of Joan's life, but in Joan's all-encompassing love for God, which informed all her courageous actions from beginning to end. You'll not only thrill to Joan's heroism; your heart will delight in her example of loving surrender to God's will. Every detail of her life will ring out to you as a joyful witness to the grace of God.”\n",

      "The author in his preface note states:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The lives of saints are history, for saints make history, and, what is more, they make it the way God likes it best. History without the saints is all warfare, battles, countries enslaved or freed, actions of rulers, change of power from one country to another. But from time to time God points toward the way he wants things done, and the pointer he uses is time and again a saint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saints are people, and they are not always peaceful people. They can fight, and indeed they must fight whenever they come across evil. This, then, is the story of a great fighter of God who was a saint. And this fighter, this saint, was a girl. She made history in leading her poor, oppressed country to victory. She made history also by showing by her wonderful example that the very first thing we need if we want to win through is faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course of my life I have read a great many books about her, and every one of them has taught me a little more about her. Today I no longer remember the names of all the authors, but I am grateful to every one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "You too will one day have forgotten the name of this author. But I don’t think you will ever forget the saint about whom I have written: lovely, glorious, young Joan of Arc.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe his intention will be fulfilled. I have read a few books about this saint, and watched a few movies or miniseries about her life. Some with a clear Catholic faith filled intent and some … not so much. This one is geared for younger readers but will bless anyone who reads it with the intention of learning more about this saint. My only complaint is the story goes from her named being cleared to today in a few paragraphs. I really feel this could have been a whole other chapter or even two. The volume concludes with these words:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Joan was never forgotten, but for several centuries her memory seemed to sleep in the hearts and minds of most people until, in 1909, a saint on the papal throne, Pope Saint Pius X, declared her blessed. In 1920, on May 9, Pope Benedict XV declared her a saint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of French soldiers invoked her in battle during the terrible times of the First World War, 1914-1918. The great commander-in-chief of all the Allied troops in the last years of that war, Marshal Foch, never tired of pointing out that “the Maid” had been a brilliant strategist and tactician. French officers to this very day are learning from her!\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1931, when the five-hundredth anniversary of her death was celebrated, the English Cardinal Bourne, Archbishop of Westminster, praised the saint who had fought so valiantly against his country, recalling that she had never hated her enemies, but wished them well. He quoted Joan’s own words to the “Godons”: “Go back to your homes, and God bless you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In one of his books, a great British leader of the Second World War, Sir Winston Churchill, praised her at length.\n",
      "\n",
      "The history of a saint continues to inspire, thanks first and foremost to the Church, who invokes her saints every day. As long as there will be men and women who love their country well enough to fight for its freedom, the memory of Saint Joan of Arc, the saint of soldiers, will never die.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1956 the five-hundredth anniversary of her rehabilitation was celebrated in Rouen, in the presence of the President of the French Republic. The beautiful cathedral, which had suffered so badly under the bombardment in the Second World War, was rebuilt. English Catholics, making reparation for the wrong the saint suffered in the long gone past, donated a special window.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is wonderfully written. It is a great book, by a skilled author in an excellent series. the writing is clear and crisp. The pace is fast. And it is written with honesty and integrity. It neither tells the story with a glossy cover or looking to discredit. It presents the facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I plan on reading all the books in this series that are in print and as many of the out of print that I can track down. I returned to this series because I had finished the 38 books in the Encounter the Saints Series from Pauline Books and Media. Those books are geared for a younger audience, and these are written for older readers and go deeper into the subject matters of each volume. This is a great book in an excellent series. My only complaint is that only about a third of the books are available in digital formats, with my dual form of dyslexia and my son’s eye tracking issues eBooks are our preferred format. These books are written for a Middle Grade or Teens in mind, but this one and the others I have read are excellent volumes for readers of all ages. A great biography of an amazing Saint, I can easily recommend this book.\n",

      "Note: This book is part of a series of reviews:\n",

      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Update:\n",
      "After reading a few children’s books of Joan by secular authors, it was refreshing to read this one again by a Catholic for perspectives such as the following quote, instead of just facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All that had happened was God’s work, and he alone should be given the honor for it. He had chosen her not because she merited to be chosen, but because it had pleased him to do so. She was his instrument, and he could drop her at any moment if it pleases him to do so. She was his creature; she belonged to him. He had made her, and all she had was his, not hers. If he chose to take it all away again, she had no right to complain.” Pg137\n",
      "\n",

      "Because this is an audio book it's an entirely different experience than sitting down and reading the testimonies of the women in this series, but nevertheless this collection managed to rekindle my love of feminism because it provided insights from a wide variety of women. Whether it was Gloria Steinem, Naomi Wolf, Phyllis Schlafly, and Norma McCorvy a.k.a. Jane Roe of Row V. Wade, each woman explored what her identity as a woman meant and how it was shaped or challenged during the course of her life. These testimonies reveal the complexities inherent to being a woman during the 20th century, and what were the hopes and ideals of women moving forward.\n",

      "Women's Equality is phrase that some might distrust because of it's connection to Feminism, which for reason has been labeled as a dirty word, but anyone who would avoid this book purely because of that title is missing something great, for Women's Equality explores the dynamic that exists between men and women, and offers up new ideas of what feminism can be and how it can benefit both men and women going forward into this next age.\n",

For as many amazing women covered here--Shirley Chisholm, Frances Perkins, Betty Friedan were especial highlights for me--I would never have thought I would actually sit through a (radio edit, I'm sure) Phyllis Schlafly tirade or a pro-lifer's argument for chastity (though I do feel as if I've now put in my time and need not sit for it for some time to come).

      "There is so much young women take for granted today. For example, back in the 70's, a woman could vote, but had no right to her own paycheck if she was married - her husband legally had control over all joint finances and assets.

      "This is a story about a teenager that was in a plane and it crashed in the middle of no where in a huge forest. He has no way to contact anyone, so he focuses on surviving and enduring. After he survives through the summer into the fall he realizes that he will have to survive through winter and he starts to prepare and find different ways to get food and make clothes to keep warm.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this story the main character is Brian. He is a teenager from a big city and doesn't know that much about the outdoors and how to survive off the land. Another character in this story is a skunk that Brian ends up calling Betty. Betty the skunk at first was a slight threat because she kept trying to spray Brian but he later finds out that if you just feed her she leaves you alone. During the story she ends up saving Brians life by spraying a bear that was attacking him.\n",
      "\n",
      "This story takes place present day. The main location in this book is the forest that Brian has learned like the back of his hand. If Brian was not in the forest looking for food or materials he was at his shelter that he made. This shelter was built against a rock which Betty the skunk lives under. The roof and walls in the first part of the story were just made from sticks and branches but when he realizes that winter is coming he winterizes it by putting mud in the cracks to keep the warmth in.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this story the author is trying to show you how not panicking in situations can be beneficial . He also shows how if you don't think something through all the way it may be the downfall of yourself. An example from the book of this is when Brian does not conserve enough food and firewood to keep warm while it was raining for many days, which could have lead to his death. So in the end the author is teaching you some important life lessons that may help you in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend this book to anyone that likes the outdoors and survival stories. This book I think would be good for pretty much any age level. The reason I liked this book so much is because I love to fish and hunt but every once in a while I think about if I was dropped in the middle of nowhere, would I be able to survive. So that is why this book was so enjoyable.\n",

The government wanted him to return with one of their psychologists to show them how he did it so that they could teach the astronauts and military the techniques he used to keep himself alive.\n",
      "When they first arrived to the lake, Brian didn’t like how much gear they had. Brian told the pilot to fly off with it and just leave the transmitter.\n",
      "They were only there three day when they were trapped by a huge storm. Derek was struck by lightning when it traveled down a tree and struck him in the chest. He was left in a coma.\n",
      "Brian had to build a raft and try to float down river to a trading shack for help.\n",
      "Brian was forced to strap Derek to the raft and navigate 19 miles down the river at a speed of two miles per hour through treacherous rapids.\n",
      "They made it to the trading shack. Brian and Derek were safe. Derek came out of his coma.\n",

      "This is a very motivational book it starts off with Brain the main character flying to go spend the summer with his dad. During the flight something very unexpected happens the pilot has a heart attack and dies, Brain then takes control of the airplane and lands it safely in a lake. This is where Brian’s struggle for survival begins he manages to get of the airplane unharmed but he is left with only a hatchet to survive. This 13year boy old grows up a lot during his survival and eventually manages to get rescued.\n",
      "• My overall impression is that it was very motivating, it teaches children that is possible to survive with close to nothing, simply by having a can do attitude.\n",
      "• This book as a very interesting cover it has dull colors but the images that are on it are still eye catching there’s an airplane, a hatchet , and Brian. The reason the cover caught my eye was because the pictures are all over the place, it almost like its begging you to read it so you can make sense of the pictures.\n",

      "I also love The Island by Gary Paulsen. I am looking forward to reading this again during the winter season. I think I read it once or twice every year and have owned it several times. I have lent my book out for others to read and it seems each time I have never gotten them back? So do I purchase again or...take out from the local library? Not a hard choice to make. Nevertheless, Gary Paulsen always makes me laugh each time I read this book. I love how the character moves and endures the challenges of having to go to a new school, make new friends and explores his new stomping ground...the island. Kind of a \"boy meets himself\" and matures as it might happen in the real world in which we live. Gary Paulsen has a unique writing style. I recommend it to young and old when they ask me to tell them the name of a good book. High Five! Gary Paulsen! Jeanne Claire Probst\n",

      "Drawn from the collection of John Miley, this is an exciting audio compilation of baseball moments that are historic, interesting, or entertaining. What a thrill to hear the all-time greatest baseball announcers calling the World Series games featuring so many of the legendary players from the 1930s to the 1970s. My favorite clips include Bill Mazeroski’s World Series-winning home run for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1960, Jimmy Piersall running the bases backwards to celebrate his 100th home run, Willie Mays’s epic basket catch, and Harry Caray in his prime calling the St. Louis Cardinals winning the National League pennant in 1964 with owner “Gussie” Busch going nuts in the background. The context of these recordings was written by Jason Turnbow and narrated by Bob Costas. If you’re a baseball fan, you are likely to be grateful that such a collection exists.\n",

      "I found this a somewhat enjoyable review of highlights of old-time radio broadcasts of baseball games. The choices were pleasingly varied, and focused on topics such as famous announcers, famous plays, interviews, and famous game endings. Many of the snippets of audio were chosen for historic significance of the events, such as three (!) versions of the play where “The Giants win the pennant!” from different radio networks, an interview with Roger Maris right after tying the home run record, and Carl Hubbell striking out 5 of the best hitters in history in the 1934 All Star Game. One weakness of the collection is that, due to the technology of the era, many of the pre-1960 game recordings are a bit hazy from static and can be difficult to listen to, and that covers a good percentage of the content in this collection. A highlight for me was hearing Harry Caray calling a Cardinals World Series game with owner Gussie Busch cheering like crazy right next to him in the broadcast booth. Comparing these older broadcasts to the current day, you understand the massive change in content provided by the analytic data now available. There also seems to be two eras before the current “analytic” era. The earliest recordings are just play-by-play announcing – nothing flowery, lots of silence and crowd noise, occasional emotion. The big change you notice in the 50s or so, with Red Barber, Vin Scully, Harry Caray, and the like, was that the announcers were more willing to “wax poetic” about the game. Seems like game calling has gone from reporting to literature to science. Makes you wonder what’s next.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This would be an automatic 5-star for me as I love the history, and the many play-by-play pieces available, including many that I've never heard. I took one star off because the publisher did not include a track listing to name the individual announcers. John Miley -- whose collection is the very reason for this -- also wanted the names of the announcers included. Beyond that, it's a wonderful way to learn the work of the very well-known, and those who you've likely never heard of. Keep in mind this is not a book but a four-CD set.\n",

      "I am pretty obsessed with Maeve Binchy. She's one of my favorite \"junk food\" authors. What can I tell you? I have a huge weakness for corny stories set in English or Irish villages, especially during the 1950s and 60s. Of course, her more recent books, Tara Road and Scarlet Feather, were very enjoyable too. Some of the newer ones, though, are pretty crummy. LOVE the older ones--these titles being among the best.\n",

      "I've read two of these so far this summer and am currently reading \"The Glass Lake\". I was so sorry when I heard of Maeve Binchy's passing... she is currently my favourite author. She certainly provides a full-meal deal of reading for anyone who (1)loves Ireland (2)loves Irish writers (3)loves a good story (4)loves character development over action stories and formula novels (5)loves a good ending where love and virtue win over the usual amoral junk. I write up my reviews on Amazon.com if you want to read them there:\n",

      "This attractive ,informative,and approachable book highlights the true,heart-wrenching stories of young men and women who are the victims of eating disorders.Body image and self perception are often skewed by the media,and the result is more than nine million teenagers with eating disorders.There are many others,and their effects are not always states alone.\n",
      "Anorexia nervosa and bulimia are just two more commonly recognizable forms of eating disorders.There are many effects and many are not obvious.Highlighted here are warning signs,dangerous physical and physiological side effects as well as treatment options.In addition to the introdution ,which describes a debalting day in the life of an eating disorder victim,there are five powerful chapters with acompanying illusrtative photos.Each section demonstartes the impact of eating disorders and breaking disorders and begin with a breakdown in form of chapter menu.\n",
      "The accessible guide to the symptoms and effects of eating disorders also includes numerous cases studies of various individuals who have experienced living with these challenges and experiences.\n",
      "One significant quote is”The second was that that if this didn't work I was going to kill myself”this was said by one of the victims in the book.Taking things like this are serious in a manner of way because these victims may be thinking of suicide instead of living in these conditions.\n",
      "Basically I feel like this book would be a good resource if you know a friend suffering from these eating disorders which will not only benefit you but that person you are trying to help.It gives good advice as if I put myself in this situation this would help me help out someone I truly care about because knowing that someone out there cares and might know how I feel may help me out.\n",
      "I really do recommend this book out to especially teenagers because as you may not know the society these days are not caring about how others feeling may be hurt and not knowing how that person’s life is going on at home.\n",

      "The genre of this book was Non-fiction. I really liked this book because it gets you in the head of the people who are suffering and makes you feel thankful about yourself.

Now that I know some of the causes to this disorder, I want to help people who are struggling and help clear their head of that thought.\n",

I believe that most students have or are facing issues with eating disorders. I remember a time in high school where I seriously considered trying and did try several methods that were mentioned in this book. Although I was fortunate to overcome the issues I had, many aren't able to do so. I believe this book is appropriate. As a teacher, one does not have to use the entire book.

      "Having just come back from a visit to Burma I was really interested to pick up this book. I had tried to find it before I left and was unsuccessful but read up a reasonable amount on the country before I arrived.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frankly, my feelings were mixed. Part 1 ,which actually takes up about half the book, is a series of essays on Burma published by Suu Kyi before she became politically active. Although there was some interesting information on the history of Burma and her father I felt as if these were a little out of place for an average reader and tended to all discuss similar issues repeatedly (background on her father and the Thakin's) or provide large amounts of information that was hard to digest (going through all the provinces of the country and talking about their key characteristics). They didn't really convey any sense of who the author was to me or give me much understanding of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that due to her lengthy incarceration there are not a huge volume of speeches and other materials to draw on but reading through part 1 I rapidly found myself losing interest. I feel bad saying that but it is just my honest feelings - it was almost as if they were put in as fluff to add some length to the text (not saying that was the reason but how I felt). In particular I felt the essay titled \"Intelectual Life in Burma and India Under Colonialism\" was a gruelling read and just not relevant enough or set at a reasonable level for someone who does not have an indepth knowledge of Burmese or Indian history to understand. It seemed to be a very indepth, analytical dissertation style piece that is very hard for a casual reader such as myself to take much from.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once Part 2 begins we move onto her political works and this is where I really found myself enjoying the book. Some of her speeches and writings really are truly inspiring. There is no question she is an incredible person but for the first 167 pages of the book I found it hard to connect with her. The background on her father (who is clearly a vital influence on her politics) was appreciated at first but became tired as I felt after essay number 1 no new ground was really covered. It's a real shame for me that I felt Part 1 was such a struggle as it really restricted my overall enjoyment of the book. They could easily have cut out 2/3 or even 3/4 of this section, left enough to provide some background history on her father and Burma, suggested some other readings for those interested, and moved on.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dont want my overall review to seem harsh but after struggling through over 1/2 the book I feel like it would be just as productive to do a little background reading on Burma before picking up this book, read the introduction and then skip straight to Part 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hopefully in the next few years we will see an another piece of literature from Suu Kyi where she can speak freely on her experiences these last 20+ years. That is something I cant wait to read.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is a collection of essays by and about the Burmese pro-democracy activist. It's split into three sections, the first being essays that she wrote before becoming politically active. This contains a biography of her father, the man regarded as the father of the modern Burma; a history of the country written for a younger audience; a comparison of colonialism in Burma and India; and a review of Burmese literature and nationalism. This section shows that she's an intelligent and intelligible writer with a wide range, but it's the second section where she comes into her own. This is a collection of speeches and essays after her political activism began. Apart from one very dry and difficult piece about economics, peace and development, they're all very clearly written and her passion and drive come through clearly. The final section is a series of appreciations of Aung San Suu Kyi written by other people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most heartbreaking thing about this book is that it was published in the mid 90s, and more than a decade later nothing has changed. Aung San Suu Kyi is still under house arrest, the military are still in control and it doesn't look like they're going to give up any time soon. Reading her words, her optimism and hope shine through: she really believed that the military would talk to her and accept the mandate of the people where her party won over 80% of the seats contested.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book shows that Aung San Suu Kyi is an intelligent, strong and incredibly capable woman. She's been called Burma's Gandhi and I hope that she lives to see her dream of Burma's transition to a democratic state.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I suppose this is what your high school guidance counselor called \"inspirational writing.\" Ignore him/her and his/her fuzzy cardigans. He/she probably has a way of ruining things you like, ranging from hot cocoa to Cinema Paradiso.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aung San Suu Kyi manages to pair an astonishingly courageous democratic strategy with graceful political writing. These aren't dense, theoretical cogitations, but commonsense illustrations of the present conditions in Burma and how they can be rectified.\n",
      "\n",
      "This collection though, was best when she was speaking with her own voice. The commentaries on her were at points charming, but I don't especially care what Aung San Suu Kyi was like in her Oxford days. We all know she's a remarkable person-- we don't need the adulations of her acquaintances to reinforce this.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Short-term objectives — such as mass demonstrations, the formation of political parties and elections — are worthless if human rights are not consistently observed.\n",
      "Upon finishing this book, I completed my set goal for the Year of Reading Woman of Color 2016 challenge sponsored by the 500 Great Books By Women group. While I will not do what I did a number of times in the past year and extend the finish line by another ten books or so, I will continue the balanced diet of reading I've apportioned for my four books at once reading policy, thus ensuring that I will extend my YoRWoC2016 count by 2-3 books, if not more. In terms of this being a learning experience, my drop in the top reviewer rankings more than attests to that. I've also become aware of what it really means when I find it easier to confine my reading to 20% of the world's population than to 40%, give or take a few percentage points. Part of it is availability, part of it is marketing, and a huge chunk is the brainwashing the concept of \"universal\" has done to anyone who's come close to standardized education. I was able to access a great number of the severely underread works in my goal count through UCLA libraries, but the difference between those and what I'll be studying for my upcoming GRE and English subject tests is vast indeed.\n",
      "Aung San Suu Kyi was confined to house arrest before I was born and was released during my second year of college. I first got a notion of her existence when I watched 'Beyond Rangoon' in freshman year of high school, a movie whose quality of being out of touch with the actual issues at hand only increases with every passing year, the change in the city name only being one of the more ironic death knells. The times being what they are, I don't see the point in reading books at the moment that aren't in some way politically motivated, whether they are records of nonviolent resistance, memoirs of genocides, and seemingly innocuous works that, for all their incorporation into the mainstream, would not survive on the premise of white patriarchal supremacy. Even I will need a break from that from time to time, but seeing as how for years I've preferred to devote my reading to realms beyond my comfort zone and save the indulgences for movies and video games, I don't see any reason to change that now.\n",
      "It's interesting how my haphazard autodidacicism prepared me rather well for tackling this work, as the title 'Freedom from Fear and Other Writings' is both technically true and wildly misleading. Contrary to what the summary states, around half to three quarters of the writing is by Aung San Suu Kyi, if that. Of what she herself authored, 'Freedom From Fear' is one of perhaps two or three essays that touch directly upon events initiated by Aung San Suu Kyi returning to Myanmar (Burma) to nurse her sick mother. To get more of a glimpse of the place in history the author is most famous for, one must turn to the pieces in the last portion of the book written by others ranging from professors to scholars to a retired UN employee whom Aung San Suu Kyi referred to as her 'emergency aunt'. The situation here is that, during the time of this book's creation, Aung San Suu Kyi was far out of reach, and the efforts to combine her scholarship with contemporary concerns means including a sizable portion of writing requires drawing on what pieces she has done on her father as national hero, her country, and highly academic articles such as 'Intellectual Life in Burma and India under Colonialism' and 'Literature and Nationalism in Burma'. If you've read anything along the lines and are already inclined towards thinking concretely about the relationship between literature and life, you won't have that much trouble connecting the dots. If you're thinking of picking up this book as your first introduction to Myanmar in the late 1980's, I highly suggest you look at instead. Saying that you'll be lost and likely frustrated by the mounds of new and highly contextualized information that manages through many viewpoints to border on repetitive is putting it lightly.\n",
      "The last essay had some reservations on Aung San Suu Kyi's leadership based on a prioritizing of a Bamar (Burmese) construction of parliament over incorporation of all minorities prior to making any decisions of the larger government. In light of the situation nearly two decades later with the Rohingya people and other Muslim populations living in Myanmar, the author was right to be concerned over something as deceptively simple as the semantics of a proposed constitution. My situation is removed from this one, but when considering the US has had some kind of hand in every military dictatorship even before Neo-Nazis started calling themselves in the alt-right in 2016, what escalating Islamophobia there is over here will most definitely carry over there. For all that, I can't say what the future holds. However, if someone was willing to spend two decades under house arrest for said future, I can only try to match that in my own way.\n",

      "I read through the first 50-60 pages of this in one sitting, then stretched the rest of the book out over more than a year, reading a single strip each day. Why? Because I'm a connoisseur of Dick Tracy. Reading them all in a jumble makes them seem too much like a haphazardly plotted comic book, which isn't fair, since Chester Gould designed them to be read in a daily newspaper. Gould was a master of storytelling in this format. He drives the plot forward each day in a fun or shocking manner. The reader never loses sight of the overall story arc, but also never gets bored with constant exposition to explain what's happened already.\n",
      "\n",
      "This collection features one of Dick Tracy's most memorable nemeses, the low-talking, jazz-music-playing, expensive-clothes-wearing hood called \"Mumbles.\" Mumbles does not look unlike Robert Mitchum, and has conversations with his henchmen that go like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Star tover.\"\n",
      "\"What did he say?\"\n",
      "\"Quits aying whadee zay.\"\n",
      "\" did he say?\"\n",
      "\"He said for you to quit saying, 'what did he say?'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mumbles is more than just a menacing hood who talks out of the corner of his mouth, he's a sadistic killer unafraid to murder police officers, punch his girlfriend Kiss Andtel in the face, or leave all his men behind to die.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gould brought his right-wing social philosophy to the pages of the funny papers day after day, but he created such a brilliant phantasmagoria that readers of any political stripe could enjoy his violent fantasies, provided they could deal with his cheerful sadism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, there are some weeks in the Dick Tracy strip that are less exciting than others. For every brilliant creation like Mumbles, there's a less-than-brilliant creation like Coffyhead, who drinks a lot of coffee and whose head is shaped like a coffee pot.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the exception of Coffyhead, Dick Tracy's rogues' gallery is pretty great in this volume: Acres O'Riley, who's an essentially good-hearted taxi driver, but whose enormous stature makes her a danger when she's enraged; her boyfriend, the tiny midget forger and hustler named Heels Beals (he wears lift heels in his shoes); Mrs. Volts, the gangster leader of an energy concern; Hypo, a twitchy drug addict, and Shoulders, a smooth-talking man with enormous shoulder pads for smuggling jewels. While Shoulders as a concept sounds kind of silly, his storyline here is really well-done. He's on the lam, hiding out as the husband of a woman who has a young daughter from a previous marriage. There's a sense of menace and unease in the scenes of Shoulders at home, and the story plays out in a suspenseful fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gould also presages the widespread use of security cameras. At the end of this volume, a new storyline is beginning in which the millionaire entrepreneur Diet Smith perfects a \"television burglar alarm\" which is officially known as the Dick Tracy Teleguard, allowing banks, homes, and government buildings to be watched at all times. There's even an option for motion-activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is great stuff. I've loved Dick Tracy since I read a collection in high school, which was awesome, but being able to read a strip a day and get lost in Gould's crazy world has been a real treat.\n",

      "The artwork is incredible in this collection representing most of 1947-48 but the story lines are much weaker than the earlier 40s. The standouts are Mumbles and Coffeyhead; everyone else, including the ludicrous Sparkle Plenty storyline is forgettable.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Lots more great stuff, despite a few uneven patches (e.g. the Crime Stoppers stuff with Junior and the neigbourhood kids out solving crime). Only a couple of really well-known villains--Mumbles, and Shoulders, in his return engagement-but the ones I hadn't heard of before were interesting as well, notably Mrs Volt, a genuinely bizarre creation with one drooping eye and a propensity to torment her dog constantly. Lots of violence and sudden death, lots of ingenious crime--and detection--and some of Gould's oddest sequences (e.g. the Acres O'Reilly/Heels Beals story, in which for several strips Acres--a very big girl indeed--runs amok dressed in a tarp covered in luminous paint and is mistaken for a ghost). B. O. Plenty and Gravel Gertie give birth to Sparkle, as well, another major development in the strip, though I don't share Gould's evident fascination with these comic relief figures.\n",

      "At about 100 pages in, I realized I didn't give a damn. What sounded like an amazing premise was slow and bogged down by some just downright stupid decisions on the part of the main character (the bad guys try to frame you for stealing by planting a mobile phone on your person--what should you do? Well, if you're the main character of this book, you stash the phone until later and then begin freely using it to text and call other people. As if they wouldn't be tracing your use of the phone . . . ) and plot holes big enough to drive a jumbo jet through.\n",

      "Sarah Mussi’s The Door of No Return is a thrilling story about revenge and redemption. However, with poor execution, annoying cliches, and at times awkward writing, not even the story’s excitement can save it from losing my interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "They say not to judge a book by its cover, but just looking at the copy I read, it kind of looked like a straight to video ripoff Jason Bourne, which made me iffy before I even read the book. Then I flipped to the back, and the summary it provided for the reader seemed to completely push me off the imaginary “cliff of interest”. The idea of the main protagonist, Zac Baxter, being a descendant of African kings whose treasure has been stolen already seems a little bit outrageous. To make things even more ludicrous, his grandfather (who tells Zac these stories) gets MURDERED. There is enough cheese in this brief summary to be used for nacho dip for a Super Bowl party. Even with all this, I still read the book because well, I had to for my English class.\n",
      "\n",
      "One big problem I found were the surprising amount of characters I liked, and I don’t mean it in a good way. There was barely anyone I found to be likable, and they unfortunately weren’t in the story much. Although the story is told from Zac’s point of view, I wished the author expanded more on characters like Wisdom and YY. The two were characters I really enjoyed, but served no purpose other than driving Zac to his destination in Ghana, and showing up at the end to help a poor ol’ Zac Baxter who probably would’ve been killed if it weren’t for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writing in this story was sometimes painfully awkward, and cringe-worthy. The character Ashley made me groan every time he said some stupid phrase that always had to rhyme. Was he supposed to be the “comic relief”? I don’t understand his personality really. The texts through Zac’s Nokia were also very painful to sit through, and read. I’m no genius, but I’m pretty sure normal people (including a “lawyer”) don’t text laughably embarrassing stuff like, “cuz i got da cheez dip 4 da soop bowl.” By the way, they don’t really say that specifically in the story. The story also features repetitive language that gets annoying after you read it multiple times. “Hissed” is unnecessarily used a lot between characters, and in one instance, a particular profanity has been multiple times to express the protagonist’s emotions, but I felt there was a better way to express emotions than substantially using the s-word in anger. The funny thing was that the word wasn’t even used in dialogue, which made it even more pointless.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, even with all this criticism, there are some things I like about the story. I love the simple idea of risking everything to do the right thing pursued by Zac. Zac is also a brave, heroic, and responsible character who has the courage to go on a very dangerous journey just to seek vengeance on those who killed his grandfather and sold his ancestors into slavery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, The Door of No Return is a novel with so much potential I tried to enjoy, but ultimately let me down with its cliches, and awkwardness.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A 16 year old boy named Zac Baxter discovers that his ancestors hid gold in an old slave fort in Ghana, he must go out and find the gold. Door of No Return by Sarah Mussi is a realistic fiction adventure story About a boy who must avenge his grandfather, and go seek out treasure from his ancestors. This book was not so great, the story was way too cliche and predictable, the characters are extremely bland and boring, the book was very slow at times, and many parts of this story made absolutely no sense.\n",
      "First of all, the story of a kid discovering that their family has a big secret, and the kid must go find it is a theme that has been used throughout all sorts of media. It was very predictable what was going to happen. Second of all the characters were just way too boring and average no one had much personality. Thirdly, the book was extremely slow in the beginning. It took half of the book for Zac to get to Ghana. At no point in the book was I excited\n",
      "In conclusion this book was pretty mediocre with not much personality. I wouldn’t recommend this book.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I didn't realize this book was going to end up being about reparations for slavery. I think the reparations debate is completely silly (especially given the state of the economy these days, where is the government going to find the money to pay all the Black descendants of slaves in their country? AND how do you know if some of your ancestors were slaves, not everyone can afford to have their family history traced....) so that put a slight damper on my enjoyment of the book because I kept rolling my eyes. Aside from that I didn't like how this book was ALL ABOUT Zac. It was all in his head for the most part and the few dialogues in the book turned into monologues between characters. At times the dialogue/slang sounded stiff, thrown in just to sound 'cool' or something because otherwise it didn't make much sense (granted there was a lot of British slang I presume). The secondary characters provided background noise and help when needed (or violence) but little else, including the few people Zac decided to trust. And\n",
      "Speaking of whom to trust, Zac goes on and on about how growing up in the streets he knows not to trust many people, especially after what happens to his grandfather and his home but then he trusts someone that it seemed (to me anyway) quite clear he shouldn't. He was extra careful about everyone except the one person he needed to be which made it seem too obvious as to who was going to betray Zac. I was even more disappointed in the long history of Ghana (provided in a monologue by a chauffeur) it should have been presented in a more interesting, varied way. Furthermore, Ghana wasn't described in great detail. In the end Zac talks about how Ghana is the best country in the world, I wanted to love it too but I didn't get a real sense of Ghana from this book. I hated how Zac kept saying \"I regretted this\" or \"I shouldn't have done\" that, to me that takes away an element of surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some elements of the story were well done. The history of Portuguese explorers, the British & Ghanaians was fascinating to read about, even if it was described in a long conversation. A small part of the story that I loved was the location of the treasure map. It was unrealistic definitely but a cool concept. While I did not get a strong feel for Ghana, I did get a through description of Gloucester, England, that city was one I could imagine as well as the hamlet of Syde (which might be fictional?). Since the story was all about Zac and his thoughts, the emotional intensity of the story was there. I was terrified for Zac, it would be very scary not being able to trust anyone because your life depends on it. He goes through a lot for a sixteen year old (seeing his grandfather murdered before his eyes, community home, court apperances) and I could literally taste the fear sometimes especially when he was in Ghana. I don't want to give too much away but Zac goes to Ghana on the ruse of doing community service and the place he ends up at would scare me to death. I was amazed that he kept it together. There was another quote that really resonated with me, \"He [Pops] had a way of telling things; his voice pulled you into that mysterious place where the past burnt brighter than any pale present, and you hungered to be there, where 'brave deeds and terrible sacrifices' made life worth living\" (pg. 60).I can totally relate to that, wanting to be swept up in a cause that's bigger than yourself, that you believe in so passionately (ending slavery, women's suffrage, civil rights). I think my (American) generation is looking for our 'big' cause but maybe that's a lot of 'little' causes (although I think it might be immigration).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Door of No Return is not a peachy keen read which I appreciated, there are some really dark moments. I did not appreciate Zac's sloppy narration because while I liked how random it could be (after all I think most teenagers' thoughts are pretty random), the slang and his dramatics annoyed me. I really didn't like how Zac didn't interact much with other characters, basically the author used them for what they could give Zac (or hurt him for) and then disregarded them, bringing them up again when convenient. Certain parts of the story were well done such as the descriptions of Gloucester (not that I've been there), Black life in Gloucester, and the treasure map along with the story behind the treasure. At the same time, the pacing is incredibly uneven (fast moving-sloooowwwwwww-fastfast) and I wasn't completely satisfied with how convenient the mystery was solved. Ultimately it worked out that I ended up waiting two years to read this book, I didn't miss out on much.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The main characters of this book were Ashley, Raphael,and Zac. Ashley was Zac’s friend who he met when they were going through orphanages. Raphael was a long time friend that Zac knew from his childhood. The story is about Zac being the last living descendant of an African prince. The prince was sold into slavery but when the people who were loyal to the prince paid ransom to Great Britain they just took the money and ran leaving the prince to die. Now Zac is living proof that the British broke a promise of setting the prince free. Now the British spies are hunting Zac down so they won’t be found out about their lie about stealing the gold that the prince gave them. Zac has to go all the way to where everything started in a large slave base and pass through the door of no return to get the missing gold. So then he can pay back all the losses that the British have caused. “I turned. No. It was not the heavens. It was not the earth aflame. It was the guns of the English. They were firing upon me and my brothers!” (p. 197) This shows how the British betrayed the prince and took the gold for themselves.\n",
      "The moral behind this book is “no matter what don’t give up in what you believe is right”. “Here I was, the last true descendant of King Baktu, about to step back through the door of no return.” (p.339) This is showing that after all this time Zac finally accomplished all of his goals. I think the author did a very good job with this book because when I was reading it I could not put it down. While reading this book I learned that if you lie about something it will eventually come back and be found out and cause more damage than just telling the truth. I believe anyone who likes a good story and likes reading should pick up this book because it is a suspenseful story that keeps you guessing why things are happening.\n",
      "I give this book 5/5 stars because it achieves everything that you would want in a book, like suspense, emotion, and a happy ending. I like history so the history in this book is enjoyable and interesting to me.\n",

Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants - and worse.\n",

      "To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.\n",

      "This is my first Warhammer experience, and the intro listed above gives one a much different feeling than what would follow (and yes Warhammer fans, I know the Cain series is an oddity in that regard). Those looking for something truly grim need not apply… though those looking for a total light hearted read should possibly avoid as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I mentioned above, this is my first Warhammer experience. While I am familiar with the game, I was never able to afford getting into it as a hobby in my younger days (I was strictly a D&D player who used friends' \"community\" books for character creation and rules). My knowledge of the universe is thus very limited. I bring this up because people in the same situation as me may like to know that several alien races are introduced with little to no description. Knowledge of the universe is very much assumed. If you are wanting to read this, I suggest bookmarking the Warhammer wiki... if you're like me you will be checking it frequently.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, some may ask after reading the above, why should I bother with a book that I'm going to be frequently checking references to understand? Well, because it is damn fun for one reason. The plot follows Commissar Ciaphas Cain, well known hero of several campaigns; he's become a legend in his own time and his name opens doors throughout the universe... but his heroic status is a bit exaggerated to say the least. The book takes the form of his memoirs, in which he reveals that his heroic acts are mostly being in the right place (or wrong place from his point of view) at the right time. For example, the heroic act of going back for a fallen soldier seems a lot less heroic when you find out that from his view point, he saw something horrible ahead, retreated and decided a human shield was the appropriate way of keeping himself alive. He is happy to use his status as hero to get what he wants, but as he says early on (setting up his character wonderfully) Cain is a hero in name only, as he'll be happy to inform you repeatedly. He is a coward, a combination of Blackadder and Flashman, placed in a grim military science fiction setting, who is supposedly know for his heroic acts; through this Mitchell is able to deconstruct the entire Warhammer setting, playing it completely tongue in cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though very humorous, it doesn't completely take away the darker aspects of its setting. People die, sometimes abruptly and in rather terrifying ways. Some of the aliens presented are the things of nightmares and there are a few moral decisions that make even Cain rather shellshocked. While this is not the grim dark novel that one may expect from the series, it is still very much in its setting and doesn't dismiss that to keep its humorous tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most interesting aspects of the novel is that we can't actually trust Cain entirely about how he presents himself. We are told at the beginning that these are his own personal journals found and footnoted by an inquisitor after his death. Through footnotes and chapter breaks from \"historic sources\" we are given a view about how people perceived Cain and how others saw his actions, sometimes outright conflicting with his report. He is caught in lies throughout the footnotes, making it seem that Cain may perhaps be exaggerating his own cowardliness... or are the inquisitors trying to rewrite his story to create a more propaganda appropriate Cain? That, at least in the first novel, is not resolved, but it creates a character that you are constantly given two alternate interpretations. Through these two extreme interpretations we are given a shockingly 3-dimensional character, who most likely falls somewhere between to two takes.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the novel suffers from some pacing issues, and newcomers to Warhammer will no doubt need references to the material, is a constantly entertaining read with a shockingly fascinating lead. Recommended for Warhammer fans and those looking for a grim but humorous read. A solid three out of five.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I adore this book and I adore this series, and I keep coming back to it time and time and time again. I first read it about a decade ago, when I was in college, and I just reread it for at least the seventh or eighth time, and still love it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic premise is that Commissar Ciaphas Cain is a renowned far and wide as a great and noble hero... while secretly being a cynic, a rogue, and a (self-professed) coward. It's basically a sci-fi version of Flashman, which is a deserved classic, except I actually think Mitchell one-ups the originals in certain ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "The setting is that of Games Workshop's Warhammer 40k, and yes, this is a tie-in novel. At the same time, deep setting information is *not* required, and if anything this series is far more comprehensible than, say, some of Max Gladstone's work (and I say this as someone who adores Gladstone to bits). Mitchell also avoids the excesses that plague some of Warhammer 40k's less subtle works.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within the context of the story, this is mostly an adventure story, with plenty of military-style action and an enormous amount of comedy derived from Cain's constant flim-flam. For the Emperor, unlike most of the series, also has an element of mystery and intrigue, with a Sinister Conspiracy trying to pit our heroes and some aliens against each other in a war -- for this reason, For the Emperor is one of my favorites of all of Mitchell's work. So, action, comedy, intrigue, mystery, gorgeous sci-fi settings, a dash of amusingly sweet romance...\n",
      "\n",
      "I might further add that while this is a very *light* book, it's also a rather smart one. There's a lot of wit in the writing, but more subtly, there's a lot of depth to the character descriptions -- Cain himself is particularly fascinating, a lifelong dissembler who claims to be a fraud and not a hero, but might be more heroic than he realizes (it's always interesting to note what Cain *does* as opposed to how he justifies it). To be fair, most other characters are fairly static in comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also interesting that Mitchell is, in his own quiet way, one of the more feminist authors to work in what is technically Military-SF. Inquisitor Amberley Vail, Lt. Jenit Sulla, and Colonel Regina Kasteen are all wonderful characters, massively different from each other, and a joy to read about.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sum result is that these are wonderful books to read when you want something fun, and exciting, and funny, with maybe a touch of genuine drama for spice. For the Emperor is probably my absolute favorite, but I'd say all of the first six books are quite good (Books 3 and 5 have the same elements of intrigue, Book 4 has the best adventure aspect, Book 6 the best drama). Afterwards I think Mitchell gets tired of writing them and they get weaker, so I tend to think of Book 6 as the grand finale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Highly recommended to all and sundry.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A fun read if you like military sci-fi, Black adder and dry britsh humor\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Ciaphas Cain is generally lauded as the second part of the great Imperial Guard Commissar book series duo, along with Gaunt's Ghosts, but it never hit quite as well to me. The humor felt forced, and the main character's self-impression as an incompetent coward never really rang at all true, since he actually is pretty badass. Would have been funnier if he wasn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never got around to the rest of the books. I heard they tend to repeat the same stuff a lot.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The 40k novel you don't expect. Or, better, the main character you don't expect. If you're familiar with Black Library novels, you know that they are filled with great warriors, heroic acts made in the emperor's name, bla bla bla. Cain Is simply just the opposite. He's basically a scoundrel, only interested in saving his own skin. Well, that's refreshing, and a very funny read indeed. I will definitely read the other books in this saga.\n",

      "Kidd is a young teen with a difficult past. He had an abusive father who's actions caused his mother to commit suicide right in front of him. Kidd was sent to Horizons a mental illness home for depression and post traumatic stress. During his stay at Horizons Kidd meets a man named Mr.Red who essentially became a father figure for Kidd. Mr.Red offered Kidd a summer job at a beach in Cardiff and Kidd decided to leave Horizons and take the job offer. When Kidd starts his job in Cardiff he meets a beautiful young woman named Olivia. Olivia becomes everything and the only thing that Kidd wants. She is his definition of love and her love is the only thing he wants. However a boy named Devon makes Kidd's task of winning Olivia more difficult. Devon is a boy who lives off of the thrill of danger and the rush of death, he is a rebel and loves to get into trouble, to him the best way to live is to live on the edge. Kidd is warned by his counselors at Horizons to stay away from Devon because he always gets them both in trouble and puts him in danger. Devon is consistent and will do anything to get Kidd to follow his ways. One day Kidd finds Devon talking to Olivia on a cliff by the beach, Devon smirks at Kidd and that's all it took. Kidd had to save Olivia from Devon so he attacked him and took them both crashing into the rocks at the bottom of the cliff. Kidd wakes up and finds himself strapped up in confinement where he daydreams about Olivia and reflects on his past. This is when Kidd realizes who Devon really is and why it was so difficult to fight him off.\n",

      "Kidd is a young man who had a difficult childhood. He was stuck with a crazy father and a mother who shot herself right in front of him. Kidd went years believing his mother did not love him because she shot herself. He was put in a center for his post traumatic stress and his depression. Kidd struggles making the right decisions, he has two sides one that wants him to do the right things and one that tells him to do the wrong things and that tells him his life is not worth living. He is a young man with a good heart he just needs help realizing it. He needs help fighting off his demands.\n",

      "Matt de la Pena is a debut novelist. He is the author of \"Mexican whiteboy\" which is based off of his life as a Mexican American. Matt is from San Diego and studied at San Diego State University. He is a young author who writes for young audiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely loved this book. The creativity of the story line was both suspenseful and emotional. I enjoy books that allow for character analysis, and this book definitely forces an analysis of each character to grasp an understanding of what is going on. The book is really difficult to follow and it took me a while to understand the way that it is written but it was still a very good read because it made me think more than I normally would while reading. If you like books with mind blowing twist then this book you would definitely enjoy it, it really gives you a run for your money.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point in the book Devon takes Kidd to the beach with him to look for trouble. Devon goes up to a group of young teens and starts trouble with them. Kidd tries everything he can to stop Devon from fighting and arguing with these teens about the meaning of life and the fact that \"poor\" people are looked down upon, but no matter how hard he tries Devon continues with his rant. Eventually Devon pulls out a gun and points it at the teens, this is when Kidd starts to really get scared and starts yelling at Devon to put the gun down. Devon starts going crazy and then puts the gun to his own head he tells the teens to run so they left. Devon then starts laughing and Kidd looks at him confused. He points the gun at Kidd and pulls the trigger.. all that came out was water. Kidd is relieved but angry and Devon thinks its all just fun in games he gets a thrill out of all of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The theme of this book is understanding yourself and who you are. Kidd struggles with himself he is trapped in his own mind with demands that force him to believe in the wrong things and to do the wrong things. No matter how bad it gets its important that we never give up on fighting the worst in ourselves. Unfortunately Kidd fights but he doesn't fight hard enough and his other half gets the best of him, but sometimes that is what it takes. Sometimes we have to hit rock bottom to start fresh. Kidd hit rock bottom literally, and that's what it took for him to let go of his bad side.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "No one would wish for the life that Kidd Ellison has grown up with. His father was abusive, and his mother could not seem to find away to keep him safe. This ultimately led to him being in a group home called Horizons. It is there that he met Red, a former surfing star who would come to Horizons to help out a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some time, Red reaches a point where he wanted to offer to have Kidd come and join him in Cardiff, where he works as a campground maintenance man. The managers of Horizons did not think that Kidd was ready to leave the facility. Some of that has to do with the company he keeps. His best friend Devon tends to get in a lot of trouble. This includes a number of suicide attempts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kidd finally reaches the point where he feels that he needs to runaway. He finds himself in Cardiff and starts to settle into a happy medium with work and friendship with Red. He also meets a girl named Olivia, and the two start to form a friendship that quickly develops into something more. She has her own secrets, which she hides under a ski cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "All seems to be going well until Devon pops back into Kidd's life. Old problems, such as shoplifting and getting into fights, start happening once again. Kidd is not sure that he wants to return back to those old ways, though, because he has finally found happiness. Their friendship becomes even more of a problem when Devon starts threatening Olivia. What is Kidd going to have to do to get Devon out of his life so he can live up to the new dreams. He is coming right up to a precipice, and someone is going to have to go over.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have quickly grown to like de la Pena and his books, which often do a wonderful job of exploring the dark underworld in which some teens find themselves. Right and wrong are not always clear, but getting a better understanding of the individual can help. From the beginning of the book, where we find Kidd stuck in solitary confinement after he has pushed Devon off a cliff, the reader is very much confused. That turns out to be most appropriate, as Kidd brings the reader through the events that led up to his current situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kidd is a very sympathetic character. The reader truly wants to see him overcome his troubled life, which is fully explored and explained as he tells the tale. This is accomplished through simple narration that is periodically interrupted with entries from a journal he has kept to explain to himself the important things about his life. The story slowly builds and culminates in a big climax and an ending with a twist that is really a breakthrough for Kidd, though I am not sure that most readers will be surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "The title takes on complex multiple meanings when considering who the You and the I are as well as what it means to be truly saved. This would make a for a great discussion title, and it is also a great examination of mental illness and the effects of abuse in the home.\n",

      "Nayyirah Waheed is brilliant, as always. Before I recommend this book, I would like to point out that her work is intended for POC (people of color). She has been subjected to quite a bit of appropriation lately, and whitewashing her words to fit a broader context is unacceptable. She is okay with non-POCs reading and appreciating, but please do your research on white privilege and appropriation before picking up this very important book.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are Waheed's own words on the subject:\n",
      "\"appreciate. from afar. from behind the boundary. it is that simple. people of colors' cultures. realities. lives. histories. are sacred. and rife with boundaries. as all sacred things are. decentralize and simply appreciate. the assertion that i do not want non POC engaging with my work is false. engagement is fine. it is the defining of what engagement means. which becomes the issue. what i do not want is non POC appropriating my work. my culture. my experiences. my heritage. my people. and i will not allow salt. or nejma. or for any of my work. to be whitewashed. exploited. exoticized. or to become an educational manual on who we are. these are my boundaries. if anyone is unclear. i wrote salt. and nejma. i write. for the health. the breath. the bone. and the flower. of people of color.\n",
      "and so i simply assert that my work be appreciated and respected and honored as someone else’s truth. when you engage a POC work. the first thought should be about what it means to that POC. what it might mean to their communities. their cultures. their histories. that should be processed. first. the work in the context of themselves and their world. then. and only then. can your next thoughts be informed properly. then. and only then. when your being. comes into the interplay. from behind the boundary of this person first. and you second. can your perspective be honest. and aligned correctly. decentralizing. involves removing yourself from the center. and appreciating someone else’s reality. someone else's art. as it is. for what it is. leaving alone what you can not touch. or access. and not engaging for what it can give you. what you can take from it. how you can alter it to serve you. but engaging as an honoring and appreciating. of accepting it. for exactly what it is. exactly as it is. exactly who it is. \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, I am a WOC and find profound healing in her work. She speaks to a part of me that has been quiet (silenced) for a long time.\n",

      "I love Salt. by Nayyirah Waheed so I was excited for this collection as well. But it didn't pack the same punch as Salt. There were a few lines that I loved, mainly being the famous\n",
      "\"I am mine before I am ever anyone else's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "but other then those few I didn't love anything else. I would say you can skip this and just read Salt\n",

      "My VIDEO REVIEW of this book is now online. You can watch it here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoyed Salt by Nayyirah Waheed, so I thought I would give her other poetry collection a go as well. Nejma was definitely an interesting collection as well, however, it didn't manage to woe me as much as its predecessor. Nonetheless, Nayyirah remains a super fascinating figure to me and I wish she was still publishing today.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is a self-described “quiet poet”, which means that barely anything about her life is known to the public. She also seems to have deleted all of her social media, so it's nearly impossible to get a hold of her. She was also way ahead of her time (she started out on Tumblr in the 00s) and even since writers that came after her (e.g. Rupi Kaur) have overshadowed her, it is important (in my humble opinion) to give credit where credit is due: many insta poets wouldn't be where they are today without Nayyirah Waheed. She truly paved the way. Back in the day, her style of poetry was heavily criticized and when she didn't manage to publish her poems traditionally, she simple did it on her own with the help of independent publishers such as Create Space. A method that is still used by insta poets today. Her approach to topics like (self-)love, feminism, and racial identity was iconic and remains a source of inspirations for many poets writing today.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The poems in come from a place of suffering and introspection. Judging from other reviews, many people have been moved by them. I can definitely see why. The poems in this collection range from the extremely angry to the tiredly gracious to the most subtle that may break your heart. However, for me, most of them remained flat. Unlike , which I found oddly refreshing and moving, the majority of poems in didn't leave a lasting impression on me. A lot of the poems just felt too fleeting and too short. On top of that, I was not a fan of the design/ layout of the book, with many pages only showcasing a single sentences, and therefore having one poem being spread out over five to ten pages. That seemed unnecessary to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, similarly to , the few poems that I did enjoy were the ones discussing racial identity (more specifically what it means to be 'African American' and how Nayyirah navigates that). There are many poems in which she calls out the effects that white supremacy has on education, beginning with the fact that all the writers Nayyirah encountered in school were white, from Shakespeare, Keats and Wilde to Plath, Wolfe and Bronte. Nayyirah bemoans the fact that she was force-fed these voices that had nothing to with her and that demanded of her to reject the nuances of her own self:\n",

      "These lines are incredibly powerful. I've been rating about how fucked up most curriculums are (whether you look at the United States of America or any European country). White is always the default. The curriculum only values white voices, white POVs. It's sickening. Literally. White supremacy and anti-Blackness can be found in every curriculum, no matter where you turn your head, as a Black child in the system you cannot escape from it. It's important that we talk about these problems, that we remove this discussion from the margins and put it in the center, right where it belongs. I really appreciate voices like Nayyirah's who speak from the heart and who speak up about how the system fails Black children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nayyirah also spoke up about the fetishisation of Black people – our bodies as well as our art. In one incredible poem she says that her Blackness cannot save any white person. She is not here to help them escape or comfort them or make them feel better about themselves. Again, it is an incredibly powerful poem that put into words what many of us feel:\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These poems of Nayyirah's ooze empowerment. She knows her worth. She knows her shit. She knows how to set boundaries. I truly admire her strength. It takes a lot of time to come to these realisations and then it takes a lot of courage to put them into words. I really loved what she said about her art as well: “my work is not a literary zoo. / for you to come observe. learn. about the animals. [...] it is a boundary. / i am a boundary.” These boundaries are so important. I feel like the appropriation and fetishisation of Black culture and Black art is not talked about enough. There is a lot of lewd voyeurism masquerading as empathy going on. Nayyirah Waheed makes it very clear that she writes for women of color. As a white woman you have to understand that her words are not meant for you, do not include you, do not address. That's her boundary. You cannot claim her work. It is hers. You have to respect that these poems are written by a Black women for Black women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also in the current context, many Black people (myself included) are left wondering whether white artists responding to Black Lives Matter are doing so because they truly are concerned about Black lives, or if they simply recognize the financial and critical benefits that go along with creating work around these subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, as you can see, a few poems in provided great food for thought and were absolutely beautiful and powerful. I wouldn't want to miss them from my life. However, it still holds true that the majority of this collection (I'd say about 80%) was completely forgettable for me which is why I cannot rate this higher. Nonetheless, I do hope that you give Nayyirah's work a go if some of these poems seemed interesting to you. It's important to support Black creators and every dime going in Nayyirah's direction is a dime well spent.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This collection started out with really really short poems, more like one liners. But as I continued they got longer and then further on there were really beautiful ones. I still think Nayyirah Waheed deserves more recognition. Her poetry is as good as Rupi Kaur’s, who I also love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really enjoyed this one but still think Salt was better.\n",

      "Rode Hard, Put Up Wet is book two in the Rough Riders series by Lorelei James. In this book you will get not one but two couples’ stories, Cash Big Crow and the woman he has dreamed of for years, Gemma Jansen, and Cash’s daughter Macie and Carter McKay. I didn’t completely fall in love with this book as much as I did the first one but it was still a sexy, steamy good book that I couldn’t put down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gemma Jansen is finally ready to move on from the death of her husband. She needs help badly on her ranch, the Bar 9. She and Cash have shared a kiss or two but she hasn’t seen him in a full year. Is he still interested or did he get tired of waiting for her? So she seeks him out and offers him the position of ranch foreman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cash doesn’t hesitate to accept Gemma’s offer as long as she agrees to one stipulation, she is the boss during the day, but he will sleep in her bed at night, and he is the boss then. It’s all or nothing for Cash. He won’t give up this chance to finally have Gemma right where he wants her, in his bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is one small problem, though. Cash has a twenty-two year old daughter no one knows about, Macie. Macie’s mother has died and Cash is trying to make up for years of being a bad father. He and Macie were supposed to spend the summer together traveling. So Macie would have to be part of the package, coming along to stay on Gemma’s ranch.\n",

      "Carter McKay is the quiet one of the wild McKay brothers. He is the brother that didn’t want to make his living ranching, but instead as an artist. He’s living on Gemma’s ranch, helping her with chores and working on his art. For the last couple of months he has been dreaming of a woman, a woman he has never seen before in real life. He has tried time and time again to capture the image on canvas but it escapes him. The first time he sets eyes on Macie he can’t believe it. She is the woman of his dreams, the exact woman that has been haunting him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cash knows the McKay family well and knows how the McKay brothers are. He is not happy at all with Carter’s interest in Macie.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Cash and Carter have a dark side, both sexually and emotionally. This book does not disappoint with plenty of steamy, sexy times. Both men often frustrated me with their emotional distance. And Carter…at times he made some not so smart decisions. He is probably typical for an artist. He would get wrapped up in his projects and ignore Macie. And towards the end he really made me mad. But of course, all works out in the end with the help of the strong women they have chosen.\n",

      "We also get a little glimpse of Channing and Colby from the first book which I enjoyed. And a little visit from Trevor. I can’t wait to get more of his story. I am loving this series.

      "I understand the need to cut slack to authors whose viewpoints are racist or bigoted in light of today’s values. This is particularly important when an author’s views were progressive in their day. For instance, Thomas Jefferson can hardly be called a racist when his views were downright radical in his time. Yes he owned slaves (during a time when this was the norm for men of his stature), but had he been around today his views on equality would likely put most of today’s liberal minded folk to shame.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Nothing can excuse . Even though it is clear that this woman sees herself as caring and open-minded, even though she writes about “minorities” in a way that she probably thinks is fair and balanced, even though she potrays interracial relationships, even though she offers graphic same sex lust scenes, even though she “empowers” her female characters by putting them in charge (sort of) in the work place – she can’t overcome her bigotry, her outdated adherence to gender roles and her downright racism.\n",
      "\n",
      "She gives us an “Indian Princess” who considers herself entitled because she is “half-white” (see what James does there? She doesn’t call her a “half-breed’ she calls her “half white.” It’s so much better that way isn’t it?) She gives us gay men who are written off as “sissies,” but at least she offers some graphic man on man on man dream sex (see what she does there? She gives us the big “taboo” made okay by the dream sequence, and she refrains from calling her “sissies” “faggots.” It is so much better than way isn’t it?). She gives us an artist who wants to make the “Indian Princess” his subject, and he wants to put her in “beaded buckskins,” riding a horse, wild and free, through the Wyoming plains. (see what she does there? She honours the Indian spirit, not Native or Aboriginal –- never that, and makes the modern savage noble again. It is so much better than putting her characters in residential schools isn’t it?) She gives us a strong woman who runs a ranch, but willingly gives over all control in the bedroom (at least she’s strong somewhere –- so that’s good); she gives us a responsible, sober strong, Indian man (at least he’s not the “drunken stereotype” as he himself points out -– so that’s good); it just goes on and on. Yep she sure gives us a progressive view of race and gender.\n",

      "Wonderful read! Hot, explicit, erotic and ultimately romantic book! In this one you get a \"two-fer\": the May/December romance of 38 yr. old Cash Big Crow and 48 yr. old Gemma Jansen, and the story of Cash's long lost daughter, 22 year old Macie Honeycutt and 26 yr. old struggling artist Carter McKay.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is all about second chances. Widowed Gemma gets a second chance at love, Cash gets a second chance with the daughter he barely knows and neglected all her life. Carter gets a second chance with Macie, after he does something incredibly insensitive and selfish to nearly destroy their growing love. And Macie is the woman who unselfishly gives the second chances to her father and her boyfriend, and in the process, gives herself a chance to have something she's yearned for all her life--a family to love and a place to belong and establish roots.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was one hot, easy read--I finished it in one day. The dialogue was sexy, explicit and snappy; the stories were interesting and hot, the characters were lovable, although sometimes stubborn. The sex scenes were smokin' hot, however, not for the faint of heart. There was a (fantasy) m/m/m threesome, a m/f/m menage, some light bondage and spanking, and some anal sex--so be warned--something for everyone!\n",
      "\n",
      "We also get to see the return of some characters from the previous book, \"Long Hard Ride\", including Colby and Channing McKay, Trevor Glanzer, and appearances by more members of the McKay family: brothers Cord and Colt and sister Keely, and an intro to Keely's friend Amy Jo, who will be featured in the next Rough Riders adventure, \"Cowgirl Up and Ride\".\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is a winner if you like your heroes hot and your heroines sassy and love two big fat HEAs--I do and I loved it!\n",

      "Terry Pratchett has a way with words. Like the children’s entertainer with the balloons, he can take a familiar phrase and with a few deft twists create some new plaything better than all the contents of your party bag. To do that trick once or twice is good. To sustain it throughout a whole book is remarkable. To keep it fresh into the 39th volume of a series deserves a knighthood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snuff is Sir Terry Pratchett’s 50th novel. That’s a lot! It’s also the most recent foray into Discworld series, a literary phenomenon that has been ongoing for 28 years now. Enough with the vital statistics though – is it any good?\n",
      "\n",
      "The story follows one of Discworld’s best established characters, Commander Sam Vimes, out into fresh territory. With wife and son on hand, Vimes experiences for the first time a holiday in the countryside. The Ankh-Morpork police force supply most of the characters for this tale from a well-stocked inventory of favourites. Lord Vetinari makes a welcome appearance at the open and close of the book, and with his hidden hand setting events in motion it can safely be assumed that Commander Vimes will not be idle in his country idyll.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with a murder mystery we’re presented with various angles on the topic of poo, an interesting introduction to the goblin race and their peculiarities, and some wide-ranging social critique. It’s not unusual for Pratchett to hold the Discworld up as a mirror in which he can satirise everything from the iniquitous to innocuous in our own world. In Snuff the critique is perhaps more heavy handed, the sentiments goodhearted rather than funny. We learn that oppressing minorities (goblins) is bad and that the class system along with the uneven distribution of wealth are neither big nor clever. I know these things and would have preferred a little more about how the goblins bottle a lifetime’s supply of snot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main weakness in Snuff however is simply that its hero is so familiar to us, so capable, sturdy, so grown and set into his character over many books, that the story lacks tension. We know Commander Vimes will come through. We don’t truly believe harm will befall his family. We expect the same man to walk out of the book as walked in.\n",
      "\n",
      "These issues with the book on the grand scale do not however change the fact that Snuff is continuously entertaining, line by excellent line, with all Pratchett’s genius on display in the small scale. And his again he achieves the miracle of making you care about his creations. In the midst of all the funnies he can suddenly turn on the pathos and within moments the fate of a malodorous snot-bottling goblin will matter to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fans of the series will enjoy the romp with old Discworld friends and some feisty new additions. Anyone who isn’t a fan should get a hold of one of the many entry-point books into this 39 novel masterwork (by all means start with number 1). And unless you were born without funny-bone you’ll soon be roaming the Discworld with the rest of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "----\n",
      "My 4* rating is to some degree influenced by the following wind of this excellent series - the added value carried from earlier books by many of these characters can't be ignored.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "We saw Terry Pratchett at Town Hall Tuesday. He’s frail compared to the man I saw at Kane Hall back in the 1990s, but still sharp. He took questions, and one, predictably enough, was which of his characters he was most like. “In my heart I know it’s Rincewind,” he said, grinning. But then he continued in a more thoughtful vein:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Twice I’ve kneeled in front of the Queen and she’s swished a very large sword over my head and fortunately, she’s missed every time. When I stood up a knight, a ferrier, a blacksmith, a soldier in the Crimean War, all my ancestors stood up with me. . . . and you find yourself wondering about your roots and arguing with prime ministers. .\n",
      "\n",
      "“And that’s the part of me that’s Vimesy.” This man who more or less accidentally became part of the power structure. A peer of the realm. Married to duchess who is on first names basis with most of the powerful since childhood. In this book, Vimes more or less accidentally takes on some of the ways that the powerful stay powerful, both as someone who believes in law that transcends the local power structure, and as a part of the power structure that just happens to be outside of his jurisdiction. It’s good for him he’s got friends in high places. Also in low ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn’t the sharpest Discworld book ever, and there are those who will not appreciate its earnestness. Vimes goes on vacation and more or less accidentally takes on the triangle trade. Unambiguously hero work.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is unabashedly one of the darker Discworld books. Not darkness made visible, though The Summoning Dark does whisper dark and helpful things in Vimes's ears. Horrible things happened in the gaps; things the author darkly references but does not explicate. There are unspoken parts of the book that make me squirm. Vimes is more of the Great White Savior than I was entirely comfortable with.\n",
      "\n",
      "The villains are also mostly off screen, which is somewhat dissatisfying. One of the things I like about the Discworld books is that the villains are people too. Maybe this time Pratchett could not bear to share their perspective. Or maybe he didn’t want to give us the comfort of really despising them by keeping them vague and mostly off screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "It felt a little like the pieces that were left over from Unseen Academicals. Like Pratchett is doing his best to bring in all the despised races of fantasy world and show that they’re human too. All parts of ourselves we’ve done wrong by. Like the man said, if humans could fall, why couldn’t orcs rise, after all? Or goblins?\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s quite utopian in the resolution. Mostly utopian. Except for the realpolitique that very few people are actually punished. Though the spiders might help.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had one of the best lines I’ve read in a long time, spoken by the Watch’s forensic accountant, A. E. Pessmial, discussing how people can come to do terrible things. “'I'm sorry. I know that I am a small, weak man, but I have amassed a large library; I dream of dangerous places.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pokes quite nicely at Jane Austen*, though not as sharply as Unseen Academicals poked at Tolkien. May have been partially inspired by how all the amazing things that her British Empire was doing happened in the silences.\n",
      "***\n",
      "\n",
      "*It goes much deeper than this. But see, e.g.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vimes’s lack of interest in other people’s children was limiteless, but he could count. “And the last one?”\n",
      "“Oh, Hermoine, she may be difficult as she has rather scandalized the family, at least in their opinion.”\n",
      "“How?”\n",
      "“She’s a lumberjack.”\n",
      "Vimes thought for a moment and said, “Well, dear, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a man with a lot of wood must be in want of a wife who can handle a great big--”\n",
      "Lady Sybil interrupted sharply: “Sam Vimes, I believe that you intend to make an indelicate remark?”\n",

      "Something Austen could not abide. Good times.\n",

      "Enjoyed it immensely. Not the best Discworld book I've read. But whinging about this not being the Best Pratchett Book Evar is sort of like complaining that the diamond ring you've been given is only three/quarters of a carat.\n",

      "This is not the best Discworld book or the best City Watch book and strictly speaking, it should be 4-stars only, but I just don't have the heart to give it less than five stars, because it features SAM VIMES, so there it is.\n",

      "Christmas was fast approaching, and as the snow was drifting down around them Chloe and Timothy took a leisurely sleigh ride through the Amish countryside. Timothy stopped the sleigh near an old barn in order to give Chloe her Christmas gift. Suddenly Timothy's dog became alert to something and launched herself toward the old barn with Timothy and Chloe following close behind. Their joy turned to shock at the discovery of a young Amish woman frozen in the snow. Chloe is not new to working with the local police chief, and at the police chief's request Chloe's focus becomes finding out what actually happened to the Amish teen. Autopsy results proved she was murdered, and as she seeks information relating to the murder Chloe encounters unsettling circumstances as the investigation progresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amanda Flower has created a complex murder mystery centered in the middle of Amish country. Numerous themes are interwoven throughout this suspense-filled mystery. Family dynamics and dysfunctional family elements come into play, and the dismay over a family member leaving the Amish faith is encountered. The importance of faith and hope also play important roles. The author has created humorous moments which relieve the tension at the most unexpected times. A suspense-filled, action-packed mystery, A Plain Disappearance is also a delightful story of romance and healing. Numerous issues are blended so effortlessly, I look forward to more of Amanda's heartwarming romantic Amish suspense! Well done!\n",

      "==============\n",
      "This was a cozy mystery that geared up my suspicions . Early on in the book a murder takes place and readers find Chloe and Timothy assisting Chief Rose in trying to gather evidence from the Amish in hopes of solving the case and arresting the murderer. There's lots of action in A Plain Disappearance. The person you would least expect becomes a prime suspect when the chief discovers he isn't who people thought he was. Lots of surprises are in store for you if you read this book.\n",
      "I liked that the author finally brings Chloe and Timothy together as they begin courting as a couple. Beth makes a decision on whether she will return to her Amish roots or leave the plain lifestyle for good. This book kept me riveted to the pages and at times it was an edge of the seat nail biting cozy murder mystery. Just the way I like a cozy mystery to be.\n",
      "Readers of cozy mystery and fans of Amanda Flower will love this book. In fact I would recommend the entire series to you. I've enjoyed\n",

It's laid out in the format of a regular baby book, but adds in a few funny things such as \"time father passed out during birth\" sperm donors name\" and of course \"babys first tatoo\". It's just a little something cute and humorous. Read the review for this book. I forgot about the projectile vomiting.\n",

      "Rare laugh-out-loud-at-every-page book for people who don't think children are little saints. Title says it all. I have given this book to new parents who have no patience for cute-speak and goo-goo talk. Forget about tiny footprints and first visit from the tooth fairy... How about first time baby bites the neighbor girl who needs stitches, or baby's first tantrum requiring that dad leave the restaurant, or baby's first Ritalin prescription, and of course baby's first tattoo. There's a section specifically for the conception including mom, dad and egg donor and documentation options for the bar that the parents met at. You can record the names of other caregivers such as baby's nanny and the name of nanny's first lawyer. And second lawyer. You get the idea. Highly recommend for those who yawn through baby showers and refuse to dress their kids in pink or blue.\n",

      "Huck Porter is a poker prodigy, having been groomed by his father from a young age (much to the chagrin of his mother). Every year the local church hosts an annual Texas Hold'em tournament and sends the winner to Las Vegas to play in a high stakes tournament. The standing agreement is that whatever money is won will be split between the winner and the struggling community. Huck's father has been the tournament champion for the last three years and it's only as his father is dying that a new tournament champion is named: Mr. Abbott, the meanest math teacher to ever dust an eraser. When Mr. Abbott stiffs the town by refusing to split his earnings, Huck sees this as an insult against his father who once donated all of his winnings to the town. As a result, Huck decides it's time to humble Mr. Abbott both in the classroom and at the poker table.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the opening chapter offers a lot of promise (Huck and the other poker players are being robbed at gun point in an elevator), it quickly lost momentum from there. I thought the premise of a small time, small bets poker tournament being used as a means of sustaining an economically depressed community was a little far fetched and Mr. Abbott was almost cartoonishly evil in his tyranny over the classroom. In addition, Huck is dealing with some pretty heavy conflicts, but they're glossed over and resolved in simplistic ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the target audience, which I assume to be 13-15 year old boys, this is probably a good read (especially for struggling readers) for all the reasons that I didn't like it. While the chapters are short and keep the action moving along, there's not a lot of description or character development, and there are several implausible situations/details that will probably sneak right on past a young reader. While I will certainly recommend the book to my students, it's not something that offers satisfaction to a more sophisticated reading audience.\n",

      "The story \"The Hand You're Dealt\" is a very interesting book filled with some romance and action. Volponi does a wonderful job with describing the main character and the situation he was in. He also talks about the other characters in detail. You'll meet all of the characters in the story early on in the story. The story starts off telling the readers the main problem in the first chapter. The problem never gets solved until the last chapter of the book. Volponi puts you in the spot of the main character and makes you have similar emotions that the main character did.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is one of the best that I've ever read. I never wanted to read a book like I wanted to read this one. Every chance I got I would read this book. I recommend this book to every one. This book grabs your attention right away and cares it thought the book. Volponi does a great job to keep your interest and to put a picture in your mind. You if choose to read this book then you wont be regretting your decision. You will be telling everyone about it and to read it.

It's a very short book just under 200 pages long and didn't take me more than 2 weeks to finish this book. The book can teach some common life lessons. and teaches sometimes how to deal with your enemies in certain situations. It shows how really competitive playing poker can really get.\n",
      "The story is about a father who is in love and very good at playing poker in their little town called Caldwell. There’s always a big tournament once a year which makes the whole town packed with people. Early on in the story the father passes away after becoming one of the biggest star playing poker players and being a barber his whole life. Once all the people start to gather up for the big tournament his barber shop gets packed with people asking him his secret ways of playing poker and not one person has gotten him to tell. Later on after he passes away the son takes on his passion that his dad had of playing poker and actually ends up being good at the game. His father wins big in the city tourney and wins a ring, which is stolen while he is in his hospital bed. Huck which is the son starts to think it's his math teacher who also plays poker and is one of his dad's enemies. This starts a lot of conflict with the school and that’s where all the action starts to happen. Overall I did like the novel, I believe that Paul Volponi puts a lot of work and effort into writing his books for his audience. He has written many books and hopefully more to come in the future.\n",

      "The Hand You’re Dealt by Paul Volponi is about a teenager who wants to be a professional poker player. This teenager's name is Huck. Huck grew up in Caldwell, Nevada. Huck’s dad taught him how to be a professional poker player at a very young age. When Huck’s dad died, hucks math teacher stole his dad's watch. Huck decided to take back his dad’s watch from his math teacher, Abbot. He wants to go to this poker tournament in Vegas to have a chance to hopefully get the watch back from Abbot. Huck was able to trick his mother into being able to go to this poker tournament by getting a job at a White Castle. This job at White Castle can let Huck be away from home so he can go to the tournament on Saturdays with an excuse. Huck will face many problems to hopefully take back his dad's stolen watch from his math teacher, Abbot. If Huck doesn’t get through all the challenges, then he may lose everything he has.\n",

      "The Hand You’re Dealt gave me an understanding of a game I probably only played once in my lifetime. I can now see the lengths people put in to be good at this game. In this book, I saw everything from sadness to anger. This novel taught me about poker life and everything that is a part of it. The order of events made the story really pop at times with the poker tournament. Lastly, I never had an idea of what a casino was like in Vegas, but with reading this book I understood what happened inside those magnificent buildings.\n",

      "Even though i know very little about poker and gambling in general, the author made it really easy to stay on track and follow along with what was going on, and i even may have learned a thing or two about the \"river\" and stuff like that. I thought the book was really good and the storyline behind the death of the dad and his watch being the prize for a year to the winner of the tournament was a good way to show that Huck really wanted to win, not only to possibly try to sneak into a las vegas tournament, but to also win the watch that was his own dads. When the math teacher comes in, You can already tell he's the bad guy and know that he will for sure cause trouble and that's exactly what he does. The book also had a lot of suspense that built up when there were big pots and large amounts on the line, and as the story progresses you can just feel more tense when reading, hoping that huck wins the pot. In conclusion, i really liked the book. Sometimes i found myself actually not wanting to stop reading it which doesn't happen for me a whole lot.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Please don’t ever get anxious or worry about me, but don’t forget to pray for me – I’m sure you don’t. I am so sure of God’s guiding hand that I hope I shall always be kept in that certainty. You must never doubt that I’m traveling with gratitude and cheerfulness along the road where I’m being led. My past life is brim-full of God’s goodness and my sins are covered by the forgiving love of Christ crucified.”\n",

      "One of my favorite research papers to write was one on Christian German resistance during World War II. While I could go on for days discussing it (which I’m sure you find shocking), I’ll just stick to one of the main players from that: Dietrich Bonhoeffer. He was arrested and later executed (23 days before Berlin was captured by the allies) for the discovery of his connection to anti-Hitler conspiracies (think the movie Valkyrie). Prior to being moved to a concentration camp, he was in prison where he wrote numerous letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Above is from one of them. Incredible. Knowing there was a high possibility he would die at the hands of people who lived by hate, he was about honoring God and forgiveness. As Timothy Keller concluded: “Bonhoeffer uses divine forgiveness to help him understand human forgiveness… As Bonhoeffer says, everyone who forgives someone bears the other’s sins.” So much to take from both of those quotes!\n",

      "Really enjoyed the sections where D talked about the problems of faith in the modern world (now post-modern). The world, according to D, has rejected God as a beginning point for science, philosophy and even theology! Christians are now called to live with Christ in a world that has rejected religion without being religious. In the letters D's ideas were not completely expressed but a lot of interesting thoughts could come out of what he did write. ONe can see where Peter Rollins got a lot of his inspiration for some of his ideas from this volume, i.e. deus ex machina, etc... I would not recommend this book to those who aren't interested in, or ready for, theological issues and perplexities. I like the fact that D could ruminate on the problems of faith, discussing Bultmann, Barth, Kant, and others and yet have a simple, real, trusting faith in Christ. We suffer with Christ in a world that has rejected God. The Christian does not run and hide; but embracing his calling to live in a world without God and suffer with Christ in that world.\n",

      "I finally got around to reading this classic. New editions include many personal letters (which can get tiresome) as well as Bonhoeffer's more theological musings. I'm impressed that he kept such a positive spirit, and thought so deeply in such dire circumstances. Sadly, Bonhoeffer was executed just a few weeks before the war ended.\n",
      "Review 4\n",

      "Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor and theologian, was hanged at a Nazi concentration camp in 1945 for his role in the Resistance and in planning a failed 1944 assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler. The version I read is only a selection, as Bonhoeffer’s papers from prison in his Collected Works now run to 800 pages. After some letters to his parents, the largest section here is made up of “Letters to a Friend,” who I take it was the book’s editor, Eberhard Bethge, a seminary student of Bonhoeffer’s and his literary executor as well as his nephew by marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bonhoeffer comes across as steadfast and cheerful. He is grateful for his parents’ care packages, which included his latest philosophy and theology book requests as well as edible treats, and for news of family and acquaintances. To Bethge he expresses concern over the latter’s military service in Italy and delight at his marriage and the birth of a son named Dietrich in his honour. (Among the miscellaneous papers included at the end of this volume are a wedding sermon and thoughts on baptism to tie into those occasions.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Maintaining a vigorous life of the mind sustained Bonhoeffer through his two years in prison. He downplays the physical challenges of his imprisonment, such as poor food and stifling heat during the summer, acknowledging that the mental toll is more difficult. The rhythm of the Church year is a constant support for him. In his first November there he writes that prison life is like Advent: all one can do is wait and hope. I noted many lines about endurance through suffering and striking a balance between defiance and acceptance:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bonhoeffer won over wardens who were happy to smuggle out his letters and papers, most of which have survived apart from a small, late selection that were burned so as not to be incriminating. Any references to the Resistance and the plot to kill Hitler were in code; there are footnotes here to identify them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The additional non-epistolary material – aphorisms, poems and the abovementioned sermons – is a bit harder going. Although there is plenty of theological content in the letters to Bethge, much of it is comprehensible in context and one could always skip the couple of passages where he goes into more depth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading the foreword and some additional information online gave me an even greater appreciation for Bonhoeffer’s bravery. After a lecture tour of the States in 1939, American friends urged him to stay in the country and not return to Germany. He didn’t take that easier path, nor did he allow a prison guard to help him escape. For as often as he states in his letters the hope that he will be reunited with his parents and friends, he must have known what was coming for him as a vocal opponent of the regime, and he faced it courageously. It blows my mind to think that he died at 39 (my age), and left so much written material behind. His posthumous legacy has been immense.\n",

      "\"You must never doubt that I'm traveling with gratitude and cheerfulness along the road where I'm being led.\" -- Dietrich Bonhoeffer, letter from prison, Aug. 23, 1944\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister pointed out how much significant writing comes from people who were incarcerated: The Apostle Paul (several of his epistles), Martin Luther King Jr. (\"Letter from a Birmingham Jail\"). John Bunyan wrote at least the first part of \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" while in jail. I'm sure there are many other examples ... and \"Letters and Papers from Prison\" certainly belongs with the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the \"greatly enlarged\" edition. The original edition limited itself to Bonhoeffer's letters, and only to those that addressed theological concepts. This edition includes many letters written to him, and his letters on more temporal matters. Thus, we not only learn about his theology, we see him living it out. We see him, also, as a plain old human with needs, wants and fears. Several of his early letters to his parents include a request for smoking materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost all of the theology comes in letters written to his friend and in-law Eberhard Bethge (who married Bonhoeffer's niece). This is theology raw, and one suspects it might have been refined a bit before it had been released as a theological work for a larger audience. Some of it is troubling, and some of it I just don't get. But the essence of it, I think, is summed up in a phrase that has become popular: Christianity is not a religion, it's a relationship. Don't misunderstand: Bonhoeffer doesn't use that phrase. But I think it's what he was getting at.\n",
      "\n",
      "This edition may have been expanded a tad too much. I don't think his random notes serve any purpose. I don't think he was a very good poet, but I don't know much about poetry.\n",
      "But what emerges overall is a moving portrait of a man of remarkable humanity, courage and conviction in a time of incredible darkness.\n",

      "آنچه که برای او اهمیت داشت وقت گذرانی با دوستان جوانش در اطراف شهر، و نوشتن قطعات کوچک و بی اهمیتی از قبیل نقد تئاتر، طرحهایی از جامعه نیویورک در آن زمان، و تصاویر طنزآلود بدبینانه ای از تجاّر و سیاستمداران بود که تا آن زمان به رشته تحریر درآورده بود، بسیاری از این نوشته ها در روزنامه ای بنام «سلماگوندی» به چاپ رسیده بود، اگرچه این موضوع بیش از یکسال، از سال 1807میلادی تا سال 1808میلادی طول نکشید، ولی به دلیل مشهور بودن روزنامه لذت زیادی را نصیب وی کرد؛\n",

      "اما اینکه زندگی نبود؛ زندگی او آن وقت شروع شد که ایروینگ جوان بالاخره عاشق شد؛ او میخواست با «ماتیلدا هافمن» که دختر یکی از قضات برجسته نیویورک بود ازدواج کند و نویسنده قطعات کوچک، اگر مشهور هم باشد، نمیتواند امید سرپرستی خانواده ای را در سر بپروراند و مراقبت شایسته و مناسبی از آن به عمل آورد\n",
      "\n",
      "تصمیم مشکلی بود، اما او میدانست اگر بخواهد همسری مثل «ماتیلدا» داشته باشد، باید از جاه طلبیهای ادبی خود چشم بپوشد، بنابراین وقتی که پیشنهاد پدر نامزدش را برای پیوستن به شرکت حقوقی وی با اکراه پذیرفت، حال و احوال خوشی نداشت\n",

      "معذلک، مرگ «ماتیلدا» به تعهدات وی برای کار با «قاضی هافمن» پایان بخشید، و اگرچه حقوق را به کلی رها نکرد، اما بخش اعظم انرژی خود را متوجه نویسندگی نمود و باز هم با موفقیتهای کوچکی که بدست میآورد، خود را در جامعه امریکا کاملاً غریب و ناشناخته میدید\n",

      "Simply classic!\n",
      "Delightfully written, this classic American folktale recounts the exploits of schoolmaster Ichabod Crane during his brief stay in the cozy little town of Sleepy Hollow. The town is wrought however, with ghost stories dangling upon the lips of its citizens and goblins lurking in every corner. Ichabod, the ever faithful disciple of the great Cotton Mather and hopeful victor in the battle for the Love of Katrina Van Tassel, is unamused by these folk legends and braves the odds in order to win the favor of his lovely lady.\n",
      "A little bit slow in the beginning. Washington Irving likes to paint the scene very vividly for his readers. He also tends to use a lot of anecdotes in his writing. But the older English style that it is written in is beautiful and adds to the subtle reminder that this is a classic of American literature.\n",
      "I loved this book. I can't believe it took me this long to read it but I'm glad I finally did.\n",
      "I highly recommend this book to EVERYONE!!! 😁\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Prose writers are voluminous and unwieldy; their pages crowded with commonplaces, and their thoughts expanded into tediousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a child of Sleepy Hollow, New York, and I have lived in Irving’s shadow almost as long as I can remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every Halloween, this town is inundated with tourists, who come to wander around the lovely old cemetery where the legend is set, and where Irving himself is buried. Behind my house is where they put on the “haunted hayride.” I went every year as a kid. A pickup truck drags groups of twenty in a trailer through a stretch of forest, where volunteers dressed in masks jumped out and scare the kids half to death. And of course no hayride was complete without the headless horseman himself, riding out of the shadows on a black horse with a jack-o’-lantern on his knee.\n",
      "\n",
      "The town nextdoor is called ‘Irvington’ in Washington Irving’s honor, and it is there that his old house, Sunnyside, is situated. The house is a delightful little dwelling, a small jumble of architectural styles—gothic, Dutch, Spanish—overlooking the Hudson River. Irving was an amateur architect and landscaper, very much of the Romantic school, and re-made the old farm he bought into a charming park, with a little pond, a babbling brook, and paths that wind through the forest nearby. On the property is a sycamore tree that has been growing since 1776, seven years before Irving himself was born.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Irving bought the property, he had unimpeded access to the river; but that changed when, ten years later, the Hudson Line railroad was built at the river’s edge. Nowadays, trains rattle by every ten minutes or so. All the old train cars have names printed on their sides; and as I sat there on a recent visit, I saw that one of the cars on the passing Amtrak was named “Washington Irving.” He is simply everywhere. There is a statue of Rip Van Winkle outside the Irvington Town Hall Theater. On the walk back to my house I passed by the Washington Irving Middle School, which I attended, the Tarrytown High School, where our football team is the Horsemen, and the Christ Episcopal Church, where Irving himself worshiped, and where his pew is still preserved.*\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside Philipsburg Manor—an old colonial farm that now serves as a historical site—is an ugly metal sculpture of the Headless Horseman. Right next to it is where the old bridge stood where Ichabod Crane met his fate. There is not much to see now, just a modern concrete construction. But if you keep walking into the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery you can see the Old Dutch Church, and, a little farther on, you will come across the man’s tombstone. Like his house, his grave is neither ostentatious nor grandiose, just a simple stone that lays in a family plot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man’s influence is inescapable. It was Washington Irving who originated the nickname ‘Knickerbockers’ (after an imaginary Dutch historian he used as a ) for the denizens of New York. The New York Knicks owe their name to Irving, and the word ‘knickers’ also derives, through devious channels, to this writer. It was Irving who popularized the myth that Christopher Columbus disproved that the earth was flat, which Irving included in a biography of Columbus he wrote while living in Spain. It was Irving, too, who originated the nickname ‘Gotham’ for New York City.\n",
      "\n",
      "We even owe our holiday celebrations to Irving, since it was he, along with Charles Dickens, who helped to make Christmas into the secular holiday of gift-giving and merry-making that it is today. Irving played a hand in the creation of Santa Claus, too, with a story about St. Nicholas in his first book. With his love of ghost stories, Irving is also one of the architects of Halloween—and thousands still make the pilgrimage to visit his tombstone in that ghoulish time of the year. I cannot even escape his influence in Spain, since it was Irving who helped to spread the exotic, enchanted image of Andalusia, and who thus helped make Spain a tourist destination; and it was partly thanks to his book of stories about the Alhambra that people began taking an interest in restoring that old ruin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Washington Irving was named after George Washington, and was born just a few weeks before the Revolutionary War was officially concluded. He was a new man for a new land. An often-told story—difficult to verify—has it that he was taken by his maid to visit George Washington when he was just six years old; there’s a watercolor drawing, still hanging in Irving’s hold house, of the old general patting the young boy on the head. Whether it happened or not, the story seems symbolic of the role that Irving would play in American literature—exactly analogous to George Washington in politics—as a pioneering leader. For it was Washington Irving who was the first American writer to be respected by his English peers. He showed that these unruly savages overseas could aspire to eloquence too.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is often marketed as ; but its original title is , and was published under that pseudonym rather than Irving’s own name. The book, often merely called , is a sort of parody of the sketchbooks that other wealthy American travelers made on their visits to Europe. It is framed as a travel book, and contains many vignettes about places Irving visited. But Irving does not stick to this theme very diligently. The book also contains some short pieces about Native Americans; and the two most famous stories, \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" and \"Rip Van Winkle,\" are both set in New York, and purport to be found among the old papers of Diedrich Knickerbocker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the collection is miscellaneous, Irving was not a writer of great breadth, and his distinctive style is consistent throughout. Thematically, Irving was a purebred Romantic. He has a taste for quaint customs, forgotten ruins, exotic places, and old yarns—in short, everything antique, out-of-the-way, and foreign, everything that allows his imagination to run wild with conjecture. These preoccupations lead him to investigate old English Christmas customs in the country, and to rail against their disappearance. It also leads him to treat the Native Americans as noble savages, the pure emblems of a disappearing culture, as well as to focus his eye on the old Dutch lore lingering about his native New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "In truth there is not much substance to his writing. The closest he ever gets to philosophy is the Romantic, Ozymandian sentiment that all things yield to time. Rather, Irving is a stylist. His prose is fluent and easygoing—indeed, remarkably easy to read considering its age—so effortless that the prose practically reads itself. The subject-matter is usually a description of some kind—of what someone is wearing, of a farm or a tavern, of a funeral or a wedding—and he steers clear of all argument and dialogue, maintaining the fluid rhythm of his pen as it flies forward. When he is not describing a gothic ruin, an old curiosity, or a picturesque landscape, he is involved in some ghost story or traveler’s anecdote. Some of these, indeed many, involve love affairs between gallant soldiers and young women who possess “that mysterious but impassive charm of virgin purity in whose hallowed sphere no guilty thought can live”—it’s quite revolting.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if Irving nowadays strikes one as lightweight and Romantic to the point of silliness, one should remember that he was a pioneer and an innovator—the first American man of letters, and one of the champions of Romanticism when that movement had hardly reached this country. And if he seems more style than substance, one should also remember that Irving wrote to amuse, not to instruct; and it is by that goal that he should be measured. Even now, Irving is a champion amuser; and even if he has some unfashionable tastes, he it still fresh and good-natured after all these years:\n",
      "\n",
      "Surely, surely, he has not.\n",

      "*I recently went to visit this church. As luck would have it, I was about to knock on the door just as the rector, Susan, was on her way out of the building. When I asked about Irving's pew, she very kindly gave me a quick tour. The old pew sits in a corner now, set aside to preserve it. The church also has Irving's bible and prayer book—tattered old things in a glass case—as well as a copy of the 1859 issue of  that carried a front-page story about Irving's funeral. \"So many people came in, they were worried the floorboards would break,\" Susan said.\n",

      "\n",
      "All due respect to Irving for being possibly the first American writer to be able to earn a living by writing; it’s not easy being one of the first, as you usually have only your own experiences and mistakes to learn from. The most famous of the fifteen stories in this collection are “Rip Van Winkle” and “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.” Others aren’t really stories as we’ve come to know them. “Roscoe” is more of a tribute; “The Mutability of Literature” is a meditation on writing (which is worthwhile if this is something you’re interested in); “The Adventure of the Mysterious Stranger” is a long character sketch that has the sole purpose of setting up “The Story of the Young Italian,” which also includes a long sketch of the character, making the previous story unnecessary; and “Kidd the Pirate” is a short pseudo-history lesson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some stories forget to have endings. “The Adventure of My Uncle” is a haunted bed story that teases a dark secret about the duchess haunting the bedroom, but peters out into an argument with the host who doesn’t want to tell the tale and then a lead into “The Adventure of My Aunt” without resolving anything. “Wolfert Webber, or Golden Dreams” has Wolfert ruin his farm digging for gold, abruptly switches focus to a mysterious guest at the town’s inn, and then leads into “The Legend of Don Munio Sancho de Hinojosa” without resolving anything. Who is the mysterious guest? What happens to Wolfert? To his daughter and her sub-plot? Was there ever really buried gold? Oh look, a different story.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of the female characters are fleshed out. They are almost always either scolding wives whose husbands could care less when they die (Wishbone left that part out of his retelling of “Rip Van Winkle”) or prizes to be won. Toward the end of “The Student of Salamanca” Inez almost has some agency when she tries to save her father from the Inquisition, but the narration saves her from becoming a real character by explaining that this is just female animal instinct. (Incidentally, there’s no real difference between the protagonist lying to win her and feeling entitled to her affections, and the antagonist lying to win her and feeling entitled to her affections.) “Sleepy Hollow’s” Katrina is more a long-delayed inciting incident than a character, never treated as a person by the male characters or the narrator. Icabod only wants to marry her so he can sell her family’s land for profit. “The Adventure of My Aunt” has a female character interested in agency, but this five-page story is the shortest in the collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Spectre Bridegroom,” “The Adventure of the German Student,” “The Devil and Tom Walker,” and “The Adventure of My Aunt” are the better structured and paced stories in this collection. “Rip Van Winkle” could have used a more in-depth focus on the payout after the build up it gave, but was one of the more engaging stories. “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” was entirely too long for the mundane subversion of the payout. It’s interesting which stories can gain the most traction over time, and the ever-changing cultural values that can be spotted as those stories are retold.\n",

A perfect example of magical realism - the real world here is painstakingly detailed, rendered so beautifully and realistically that when the magic is sprinkled in it, too, seems completely and utterly real. Plus, this is the type of book with writing that was so beautiful, a narrative voice so striking that I would find myself going back and reading passages over and over again, even aloud, just for the sheer beauty of the language.

      "==============\n",
      "First Man is largely about a black man named Matthew Henson. He was a part of history before black men were allowed to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "He journeyed with a white party to the North Pole and was actually the first American to step foot there without receiving any credit until many years later. Simply because he was black and the leader of the expedition was just the worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a deeply upsetting story that needs to be told in history classes all across the world. However, I'm not sure this graphic novel is the way to tell it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author states up front that he has taken a \"based on a true story\" strategy to the book. He states blatantly that he's bent the truth in order to form a better narrative. I do appreciate that honesty but what that's done is muddle the whole thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He weaves the narrative through Inuit mythology that lines up with the prophecy of this man coming to discover the North Pole. It's an interesting framing device but further muddles the reality of the tale.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was interested in the story the whole way through the book and it was succinct, entertaining, and at times disturbing. And then I got to the afterward that contained the actual time line and I found myself extremely frustrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main thing that stood out to me was that in the story version Henson receives recognition for his accomplishments after his wife has passed and he goes to her grave to tell her, a touching moment for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "In reality she outlived him by 12 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking this kind of liberty to emotionally manipulate the reader feels like an abuse of power.\n",
      "\n",
      "School children everywhere should absolutely learn the story of the brave hero who battled the elements and a society who didn't trust him to reach the harshest peak of the Northern Hemisphere. But they should learn about it truthfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since prior generations were convinced that a false story was true, the way to rectify that is not to put forth another false story. History is rewritten enough as it is!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is one of those books that I like less and less the more I think about it. Upon initial reading I was grateful to have learned about Henson of whom I otherwise was ignorant. But now I'm just kind of mad that the more I look into it the more falsities this book contained.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would love to see a version of Henson's story told by an African American, with respect and dignity. Not this one put out by just another white guy rewriting history to suit his needs.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "If you go to the last couple pages of this book you will arrive at the afterward. And though this book is a heart-breaker, there is a note of victory upon witnessing its final contents. First, the map: \"The site of Matthew Henson and Robert Peary's journeys toward the North Pole.\" (Matthew's name listed first). Then, the chronology: \"First Man: Reimagining Matthew Henson is a literary retelling of Matthew Henson's life. Not all aspects of the graphic account are historically accurate. The list below presents milestones from the life of Matthew Henson in chronological order.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the chronology is interesting to read. It offers a very different picture than the graphic novel, which is good, because I think they both have a lot of truth, both emotional and historical accuracy (which don't always go hand in hand.)\n",
      "\n",
      "It is such a relief to see a little poetic justice in this beautiful, poetic book. The art is just right, compassionate and humanizing while still cartoonishly accessible. Panels shifting in size and texture to accommodate the different landscapes, textures and moods. The colors (I don't know what this kind of color scheme is called, not black and white, but not in full color either), and the use of caricature, and folksy-mythological art, give this book a graphic language that deepens the complexity in subtle ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this book, we learn that during most of Henson's life, his talents were appreciated only in so much as others were, and particularly, Peary, was able to exploit them. But even that is not entirely true. Henson was, it seems, beloved by the Innuit people he traveled with. There was a mutually appreciative and respectful relationship there. And in this book Henson and his Innuit friends are celebrated while Peary and Cook show up to this literary party as pathologically selfish fools.\n",
      "\n",
      "My main complaint is that the beginning is a bit choppy. And when I read the timeline in the back I find myself wishing that some of the stuff in the timeline was made more clear in the story.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Matthew Henson was one of the first men to reach the North Pole. He was a member of nearly all of Robert Peary's expeditions and, because he was a black man, received little recognition for his work until late in his life. In the introduction of this book the author states that when he wrote this book he made \"no attempt at nonfiction.\" It's clear when comparing the novel just to the supplemental materials included in the back that he was uninterested in the facts of Henson's life, and overall the impression of Henson the novel gives is a pathetic rather than heroic figure. The novel is framed in two ways. First, Henson is set up as a mythological character in Inuit tradition called Mahri Pahluk (Henson's name among the Inuit), with a storytelling voice setting up the myth. The other framing devices sees Henson as a widower in New York, working as a janitor at the Museum of Natural History and the ways in which his life in New York, panel by panel, mirror his life as an adventurer. These framing devices might be okay, if either of them were true.\n",
      "Schwartz says in the introduction that he became fascinated with telling this story when he learned that Henson \"has become part of Inuit mythology as the mystical figure Mahri Pahluk,\" but he never, here or in the selected bibliography, says where he learned that, or any, of the Inuit mythology presented in the book. And it's clear from the imagery and actions of the Inuit characters in the novel that he means Henson not just to be a folk hero like, say, Johnny Appleseed, but a prophesied figure who is recognized as such immediately upon his arrival (and who, later, magically survives falling the in the ice and magically knows just when they reach the North Pole).\n",
      "Real life Matthew Henson never worked as a janitor at the Natural History Museum. After his final northern expedition, he got a job as a customs clerk and lived with his second wife, Lucy, until his death (she died over 12 years later).\n",
      "I found myself frustrated with the way the author bent and used the Inuit mythology, downplays the role of the Inuit men who were also co-discoverers of the North Pole, and how he layered on injustices done to Henson and made him out as a passive figure in his own life. There is so much that is true and fascinating about Henson and his life and a real legacy he left in the Arctic, a little son whose many descendants live in Greenland to this day. It is a disservice to tell this kind of a story, washed over in magical stereotypes of both black and Native peoples.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "If I had an endless supply of money, I would buy a copy of this book for every school library in the United States. The book succeeds on countless levels and leaves the reader with the desire to dig through it numerous times to revisit the nuances of the numerous story telling paths. It works as a personal introspection of an aging man who is haunted by his more agile days. It works as a tale of the courageous and humble path of a hard-working African American who was not respected as he should’ve been. It works as a mystical Inuit fairy tale. It works as an introduction to a rarely told exploration story.\n",
      "\n",
      "At it’s base “First Man” reimagines what the experience would’ve been like for Matthew Henson as he assisted the arrogant and selfish Robert Peary explore the arctic landscape until they reached they’re ultimate goal of discovering the North Pole. The story drifts into Henson’s reverie of the love his life, and hints at the mystical beliefs of the true first men of the North Pole, the Inuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The illustrations have as much vfirst manariety and complexity as the story line. At first view they have a simple cartoonish quality. The villians have pointed chins and the hero is soft and round. All of the coloring is in shades of gray and blue which give the reader the chilling feel of the arctic. The sections that delve into the Inuit fantasy have more lines, patterns and a petroglyph type style. The texturing and detail in the illustrations of the city buildings, museum and ship frames have the same underlying layers and complexity as the story- they are there if you choose to see them.\n",
      "Because this is a reimagining, the text can’t be used directly for lessons on the event. The author states in his intro,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not a historian but a graphic novelist, which is why I mad no attempt at nonfiction. I played with the story. I gave myself freedom with the narrative, although readers can find a timeline at the back of the book that doesn’t take the same liberties.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It can however be a powerful tool for kids who don’t relate to text only books and for kids who think on deeper levels and would enjoy the challenge of sifting through the multiple layers of this complex an beautiful story. Although this is an appropriate book for teens my hope is that adults will also discover the beauty, depth and passion of this rich graphic novel delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "This title was originally published in German in 2012 as Packeis.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I liked a great deal about this book, including the art and the incorporation of Inuit myths. However, I found it hard to tell what was actually biographical and what was fiction and that bothered me. I don’t think the life of Matthew Henson is that well known, so trying to figure out what he really experienced and what the author made up was challenging. There is a helpful chronology at the end that includes pictures, but that is not enough to make me recommend this.\n",

      "I was disapointed. I had enjoyed the last opposing viewpoints I read but this one each side cited different statistics for the same thing, and also I noticed all the viewpoints against birth control were written by religious people. They especially made me mad with the one that said pharmacists should have the right to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions because everyone has the freedom to choose. However they are eliminating some persons freedom to choose by refusing to fill a prescription. Also the one about the morning after pill gave false information, it said that it causes an abortion because some people believe life begins at fertilization (that's incorrect, the pill only prevents fertilization), and they also said that the pill is dangerous because it hasn't been studied enough and is just a really high dose of the monthly birth control pill, which also is incorrect (it is the same ingredient as progestogen only birth control but others are different). Also every thing they claimed the plan B website said was untrue (I checked). These people need to check their sources.\n",

      "God Loves Hair by Vivek Shraya is a very impactful collection of short stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "God Loves Hair follows an Indian boy navigating through growing up and standing out. He has to deal with gender, race, and religion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend God Loves Hair. This book teaches you so much in a short book. Shraya discusses many important topics some of which are not frequently discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I listened to the audiobook narrated by Vivek Shraya and she did a great job narrating. Having the author narrate this book really added to the impact and added emotion to an impactful story.\n",

      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "It's hard to believe these are Vivek Shraya's first stories! Sweet and funny and sad, they're about her youth and growing up, with topics like plucking eyebrows, being bullied at school, a 'love affair' with God, and more. They often end at exactly the right time, just leaving you wanting more but also with a feeling that the story ended just when it should have. What impeccable timing!\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "An interesting collection of stories, as colourful and unique as the author herself. Vivek Shraya is a popular musician, writer and visual artist. Born to Indian parents settled in Canada, Shraya came out as transgender in 2016, at the age of 35 and chose she/her as her preferred pronouns. She uses her childhood memories to create short stories for this book. The stories span a variety of personal experiences, and show a child struggling to come into “his” own in the confusing world around. This was a nice read for me, equally insightful and entertaining. The language is quite simple yet the stories hold your attention. The illustrations accompanying the stories were a perfect add-on to the stories and complemented them well.\n",
