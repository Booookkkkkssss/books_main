      "==============\n",
      "I received this book for free from the publisher (Quirk Books) in exchange for an honest review.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved this book! I love history, especially when it comes to topics that are not talked about much. So naturally, this book was right up on my alley.\n",
      "\n",
      "This edition of the book features profiles of all the First Ladies, including the most recent one, Melania Trump. It gives a short biography about each First Lady and her time in the White House, as well as some fun facts and stories. There are also some fun illustrations (which I loved).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest takeaway from this was that so many of the First Ladies had tragic lives. Many of them were upset and cried when their husbands became president. A lot of them had to endure a bunch of bad stuff (absent husbands, children dying, health problems, long travels, etc.) to help their husbands get to the White House. I had no idea that this was the reality for a majority of them. Their lives were not as glamorous as some may have thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly anyone ever talks about the First Ladies (especially the earlier ones) so it was really insightful to learn more about them. They deserve more recognition than they get.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, if you want a fun little history lesson on the First Ladies, then look no further, this book is for you!\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I'm giving this a five star since I'd really only thought this would end up being a good bathroom reader, if you know what I mean. Instead, I found myself rereading my favorite wives or referencing them in conversation. The short excerpts are perfect for a shorter attention span (or a bathroom reader, lol). All the extra insider details read like that favorite history teacher who gave you all the real scoop.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "There isn't so much plot in this book as there is anecdote - and yet it still manages to capture attention and flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance - Martha Washington might have been involved in the death of her first husband's half-brother? It's just not the picture I had in my mind of our first First Lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "And being as Grover Cleveland wasn't particularly prominent in my childhood education, I hadn't heard the details of his White House marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really, Grover? Your former ward? The daughter of your best friend? Proof that there were People of Wal Mart long before there was Wal Mart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because\n",
      "is not a story, but a series of vignettes taking a gossipy look at the lives of the women behind the men leading the nation, it can be read in short bursts while waiting for kids at sports practices, at doctor's offices, or while waiting for the slow wheels of bureaucracy to... do anything. Leaving and coming back to the stories presents no hardship in how they are processed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Cormac O'Brien writes up gossip better than the Daily Mail, so the entertainment promised is delivered with exponents tacked onto the end. Delivered so well, in fact, that I immediately bought his .\n",
      "\n",
      "On a final note, I had no idea that Martin Van Buren neglected to even mention his wife in his memoirs. What a jerk.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Well, that was fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "My f-t-f book club is reading the lives of First Ladies, each participant picking one and reading about her, but, of course, I couldn't do that, so instead I decided to read about all of them (up to 2005, anyway, the book's copyright date).\n",
      "\n",
      "I found I especially liked Mary Todd Lincoln (who doesn't?), Lou Henry Hoover (a geologist), Lady Bird Johnson (with such a bossy husband), Laura Bush (who knew she smoked until the 1990s?), as well as Abigail Fillmore (started a library at the White House) and Florence Harding (wife of the most corrupt president...though this title could be questioned today, perhaps).\n",
      "\n",
      "What did the best of these First Ladies have in common? Ambitious for their husbands. Very bright. Right hand man of the president. Able to overlook flaws of the presidents and focus on their strengths. Multi-taskers. A strong sense of what was right.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fun read. I may look for more of this series from Quirk Books.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This was different than the stories you get of presidents. This is from the woman side, you find out that a lot of will-be presidents married up for money or prestige. I’m sure love too. There were a lot of first ladies that didn’t want their husband going to the White House. There are more first ladies more troubled than you’ll believe but there are more ladies more talented than we ever knew. The women in the book were more interesting than their husbands.\n",
      "Jason Rekulak was an editor of this book. He wrote a fantastic book called “Impossible Fortress.”\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Very good book, second chance story with a mystery going along with it. This isn't really a stand alone story as the first book, A Brother's Honor, should be read first to get the full story. The main focus in this book is Caden, the middle brother, and his relationship with Shiloh. Caden and Shiloh had been friends as kids, until Caden's mother was murdered and his father imprisoned for it. Shiloh's parents forbid her from seeing him again. They renewed their friendship after they were grown and away from home, where it grew into a deep love for each other. Their plans to elope were interfered with, leaving Caden feeling betrayed and Shiloh wondering what happened. Four years later Caden finally learns the truth and is determined to win back Shiloh's love and trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caden came across as a bit of a jerk at the beginning. His attitude toward Shiloh when she came to him with what she discovered about their aborted wedding was really bad. I got that he was hurt by what he saw as her betrayal, but considering the source of the information he should have investigated more. I liked the way that he realized how badly he had screwed up once he did have the truth and knew it was going to be a struggle to win Shiloh back. Shiloh had suffered from her heartbreak for a long time, and after the latest confrontation with Caden had finally decided it was time to move on. Having him show up and admit he was wrong was satisfying for her, but she wasn't so sure she wanted to risk her heart again. I enjoyed Caden's persistence and Shiloh's attempts to resist. A near death experience for Caden showed Shiloh that her love for him hadn't died and being together was more important than hanging on to her hurt. Their relationship continues to grow as they deal with questions of who might be trying to kill him and the ongoing puzzle of who was really responsible for his mother's murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the story are more clues showing that Shep Granger is indeed innocent of his wife's murders. He may be stuck in prison, but he is still receiving threats against his family if anyone tries to prove him innocent. I love seeing how he has made use of his time in prison and the influence he has had on the lives of others. That influence ends up helping him protect his family, even from behind bars. I also enjoyed seeing his relationship with his lawyer and look forward to more of it in the next book. The clues we get about the murder lead to the idea that there was more to it than a lover's quarrel. The last chapter contains a twist that I really didn't see coming and will be very interested in seeing what comes of it in the next book.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also some good parts dealing with the ongoing relationship between Jace and Shana. I loved seeing the way that Jace's happiness is an example for his two brothers, even though they may not always appreciate it. They are still dealing with some of the fallout from the corporate spying in the first book and a suspected murder has them thinking that their troubles aren't over yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shana's dad also has a continuing storyline with his new lady friend. I loved his conviction that her blindness doesn't matter. I really liked his conversation with his daughter about his feelings for her late mother and the difference in his feelings now.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most enjoyable parts of the book is Dalton's search for the woman that he met in a bar one night. Dalton is the brother who is the biggest player of them all. He's never had to work for a woman's attention and it seems to have gone to his head. When he tracks down the mystery lady he's surprised when she wants nothing to do with him. He has an even bigger surprise in store when he finds out who she is. His book should be very interesting.\n",

      "I thoroughly enjoyed this book, hence the 5 out of 5 rating. It is the second book in a series, but it contains enough details so that you'll know what's going on and get caught up in the story. There's a romance, naturally, and an ongoing mystery that continues through the series. I highly recommend. Kudos Ms. Jackson!\n",

      "I loved it and found it a continuation of the first series...'A Brother's Honor.' I would definitely suggest you read the first series to truly understand what is going on in the second series. \"A Man's Promise\" was mainly of Caden Granger and Shiloh Timmons love story and it was a real interesting one that will bring to us 'lies, misunderstandings, secrets hurt and betrayal.' Now add some mystery, suspense, romance, drama and conspiracy into all of that and you have one amazing story that just keep on going into the next series. ..Dalton's story. I don't want to give too much away just know that the Granger brothers...Jace, Caden and Dalton will give you a such a intensed read from start to finish. By picking up 'A Man's Promise' you will find that this author has done a excellent job giving us a well written novel from start to finish with all of its twist and turns. The characters were all simply off the chart ...well wait a moment...their were a few to shake you head at...but mostly all were well developed, well portrayed, colorful and so believable only helping to give the reader a well attention grabber and oh yes I loved that ending...a cliffhanger. This was very well done. The only thing left to say is I will be waiting for the next series.. about Dalton and I am sure there will be even more for us... unlocking and tying it all together in this who, what, when and why of it all in this last series.\n",

      "\n",
      "Caden and Shiloh were close as kids but after the murder of his mother, Shiloh was forbidden to have any contact with him by her father. Shiloh and Caden would reconnect again and built on their friendship from childhood. They fall in love and decide to elope and spend the rest if their lives together. Shiloh's father gets wind of the plan and puts one of his own in action. This plan would separate them for years.\n",

      "Shiloh learns the truth about her father's deception after his death. Her first thought is to tell Caden but he is still to hurt by what he believes is her betrayal. Her mother eventually tells him the truth in an apology since she believes he has already been told the truth. Once he learns the truth, he becomes determined to win her back. Shiloh is not feeling him right now and is determined to stay away from him. Yet, we know when a real man makes a promise there is nothing you can do to stop him.\n",

      "This is a (very loose) retelling of Cinderella in a historical romance format.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronwyn is a minor Scottish lady. She, her eccentric inventor father, her stepmother, and her two younger stepsisters are living in genteel poverty - able to keep on a servant and a cook, but sometimes unable to afford firewood or the ingredients for apple tarts. Sense and Sensibility-like.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, Bronwyn is reading in the forest with her two wolfhounds, Walter and Scott. A huntsman chasing a small fluffy white dog bursts into the clearing. He is Alexsey. He is an arrogant jerk. In this opening scene, he snatches away a book she's been reading, reads a few passages out loud, and declares its kissing descriptions to be bunk. When Bronwyn protests, he states that she must know nothing about kissing, and starts kissing her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was like, \"Excuse me. You just met this woman. You don't know her. She doesn't know you. You guys are alone in an isolated part of the forest. She didn't flirt with you or make any sign that she wanted to be kissed by you. You do not have a right to touch her. Back the fuck off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She runs off, leaving a shoe behind, which Alexsey keeps. He thinks she is a servant girl and is excited at the thought of having an affair with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 40 pages later, there is a ball. Bronwyn, who at 24 is considered \"on the shelf,\" attends as a chaperone for her two younger sisters. There she is surprised to learn that the huntsman who kissed her in the forest is really a half-fake-Russian-speaking country/half-Gypsy prince. And he is surprised and dismayed to find that she is a minor lady. That will make his seduction of her all the more difficult. Her mother immediately starts pushing her gorgeous middle daughter, Sorcha, at the prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the prince and Bronwyn have a dance, they have the following conversation after Bronwyn steps on his toes:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Um, excuse me. I have to go vomit in the corner now. He just MET this woman and I cannot even believe what he is doing and saying. It is disgusting and he is a pig. Thanks be to God that he didn't actually attempt to spank her at any point, or mete out any other form of punishment, because if he did this would be an instant DNF for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some days later, he stumbles upon Bronwyn in the park and there's more kissing. More mutual this time, which I was grateful for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, now, here's the rub. Alexsey's gypsy grandmother hates Bronwyn and has her heart set on him marrying Bronwyn's younger stepsister, Sorcha. So she's always arranging teas together between the families. On one of these teas, Bronwyn accidentally overhears Alexsey talking to his (even more of a jerk) best friend, Strath. He states that he WILL \"have\" Bronwyn, and what's more, he's going to actually pretend to court her so that his grandma stops nagging him about getting married.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronwyn decides to seduce him in equal measure so that ... I don't know... at the end she can say, \"gotcha!\" or something? Whatever - this is one of those ridiculous romance plans that don't make any actual sense. So they are each trying for the same thing - seduction - although with Alexsey having slept with half of Europe and Bronwyn being a virgin who was just kissed for the first time a few days ago, it's pretty much the sacrificial lamb going to slaughter here.\n",
      "...\n",
      "\n",
      "THINGS I HATED:\n",
      "1.) And this is the most important one: Alexsey, the \"hero,\" is a domineering, bossy, arrogant asshole. He refuses to take 'no' for an answer, multiple times. He tells Bronwyn what to do and expects no argument. He is toying with her and wants an affair with her even though he knows if it was ever discovered, she'd be ruined for life.\n",
      "\n",
      "He actually has sex with her (instead of playing: Everything But), seemingly forgetting, despite all his knowledge of sex and women, about a little thing called \"pregnancy.\" He can leave at any time, nothing can hurt his reputation, but she and her family will be ruined if she is pregnant. This never seems to occur to him or bother him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's constantly taking Bronwyn's spectacles off and asking her not to wear them. I'm like: \"She needs those to SEE, you asshole!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He has no regard for anyone but himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and then there's this scene. Okay, Bronwyn and Alexsey are settled in to read together. He says that she can have kisses any time she asks for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just ask,You\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What a prideful, arrogant asshole. With no sense of humor. In my opinion, men with no sense of humor are shit in bed. I felt so sad for Bronwyn. If a guy has his head this far up his own ass, there's no hope for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did I mention that he has unprotected sex with her, because he's a piece of shit with no regard for her life or feelings? Yes? Okay then.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.) Alexsey's asshole best friend, Strath, who is even MORE of a jerk than Alexsey. I know. You can't believe it. I can't either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strath, who also sleeps with anyone in a skirt, has a huge problem with Bronwyn's gorgeous younger sister, Sorcha. She's so beautiful. Because of this, Strath immediately thinks she's a stuck-up, vapid, selfish twit. Actually, Sorcha is a very sweet, caring, book-loving girl. He is judging her solely on her appearance and the fact that he lusts after her but thinks he can never possess her. This makes him very angry. This guy is the type of guy who ends up murdering women because they turned him down for a date, e.g. Elliot Rodger.\n",
      "\n",
      "And do you want to know the worst thing? The absolute worst thing?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THINGS I LIKED:\n",
      "1.) The cute, tiny, not overwhelming Cinderella aspects. Hawkins does a great job of very subtly weaving Cinderella elements into the story. It's wonderful. From the lost slipper, to the ball, to wearing her stepsisters' castoffs, to being locked in her room, ... there are just so many wonderful little details that are there if you are looking for them. But this is very underplayed, and so much the better for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.) Bronwyn's stepsisters and stepmother and not evil, but kind. Bronwyn's two stepsisters (Sorcha and Mairi) are sweet and also her best friends. Even though they are prettier than Bronwyn, and more interested in balls, all of them are loving sisters and good friends.

      "3.) Bronwyn's character. Even though I feel like the description of Bronwyn (plump, brown-haired, freckled, and wearing glasses) was only for show (she was obviously not chubby. I think the author just meant \"she weighs 130 instead of 100) - I felt like her PERSONALITY was really fun and quirky. She loves books, she loves her huge dogs, she willingly helps with chores, she helps her father file patents on his inventions, she is a HORRIBLE dancer (which is pretty funny during the ball scenes)... She's just got a really cute personality that I liked.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.) The best, absolute best scenes are when Bronwyn uses stuff from her romance novels to seduce Alexsey. It's HILARIOUS. Pure gold. I was laughing out loud, these scenes were so funny. She studies up on his home country, and then spouts all these facts about it over tea. Or the time when she thinks she can win him over with singing, and starts singing in the middle of a make-out session with him. OMG It was so funny. Then there's the time she decides she has to have a 'unique scent' that he will always remember her by, but can't find any good perfume, so... LOL Well, you'll have to read the book to find out where THAT goes, but trust me, it's comedic gold.\n",

      "Alexsey Romanovin enjoys his rakish ways and has no intention of marrying despite his grandmother’s machinations. When Alexsey meets brainy and bookish, Bronwyn Murdoch, he realizes that courting her is the perfect solution as she will never meet his Tata’s requirements. Bronwyn enjoys her quiet life and has plans of her own for the spoiled and arrogant prince - none of which include falling in love with him.\n",

      "\n",
      "Bronwyn is a lovely heroine and the fact that she always has her nose buried in a book makes her very relatable to the bibliophile in me. She sees straight through Alexsey’s suave charm and the seducer ends up being seduced himself.\n",

Although her stepmother is preoccupied with social enhancement for her daughters, she seems to truly care for Bronwyn (even though there are moments when this is questionable). Her daughters, Sorcha and Mairi, are very likable and my main complaint is that Sorcha’s relationship with Alexsey’s friend, Strath, is underdeveloped.\n",

      "\n",
      "With a little bit of inspiration from Cinderella, The Prince Who Loved Me tells the tale of the loveable shy spinster Bronwyn and the dashing rakehell prince Aleksey. He is intrigued by her and would like to whittle away the country hours by engaging in some bed sport. She is wary of his slick charming attitude but would like to have a real life adventure that she so often reads about in books. Both are looking for just some light and fun interactions. Fate, well it has its own agenda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronwyn is a very likable and relatable character. She lost her mother as a very young girl, began to emulate her father, worried the family with her unladylike behavior, and ended up with a stepmother and sisters. Unlike Cinderella however, Bronwyn gets along with her new family members and while she is compared to the older more beautiful one, there is no resentment or jealously. Bronwyn is very strong minded and while at times she may lack self-confidence, she also goes after what she wants; readers will enjoy cheering her on. Our hero Aleksey is the one I had a problem with. For a large part of the story he was very selfish, immature, and displayed an overall unattractively young personality. I can see why he was attracted to Bronwyn, intelligent and different from anyone he had meet before but beyond his good looks I have no idea what Bronwyn saw in Aleksey.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story moves at a good pace, I'm just not sure anything really happens for eighty percent of it. A majority of the story arc is Aleksey trying to convince Bronwyn to simply be in his presence. Their interactions are all fairly quick and barely move beyond the \"I want to seduce you\" \"I can't allow myself to be seduced! But oh my, look at those gorgeous eyes!\" Without any real substance to their connection I was left feeling very bereft when their first love scene occurred and wasn't as emotionally involved as I usually like to be when they eventually came together. The \"villainous\" grandmother and stepmother were extremely overdone and detracted from the story rather than added to it as this story arc went on for too long and overshadowed Aleksey and Bronwyn towards the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronwyn was a keeper character for me, unfortunately Aleksey never measured up. I also wish we could have seen them interact more away from the seduction/trying to avoid plot so more material could be gathered as to why these two felt such a strong connection to each other. Ms. Hawkins can write, lamentably, this book fell short.\n",

      "Full Disclosure: I Owe Part of My Heart to Kindle Alexander\n",
      "\n",
      "My use of the title of one of Kindle Alexander's best books (well, they are all \"best books\" in MY book) to lead off my headline of this review is done for two reasons: 1) It's the theme of the book, and 2) it's personal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's get the personal out of the way. I have corresponded with Ms. Alexander for a couple of years because I just love what she does with men who have some serious issues about loving other men. A lot of authors do this very well, but she does it for such a wide cross-section of men in so many situations that I just kept telling her this, and she kept writing back and we had some very nice philosophical discussions (by e-mail only, we have never met or talked or Skyped or connected by social media), and shared some personal histories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I was completely taken aback when I saw to whom she dedicated this book--Bo--and I sent off a missive asking if she knew someone else by that name, and she said, \"no, silly, it's you.\" And I nearly died on the spot--after my jaw hit the ground. Full disclosure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just so you don't think I was unduly influenced by this unbelievable honor, I wish to let you know that it took me a few days to let that settle in, and then I started to read, nervously. After all, what if I didn't like it? And, actually, the first couple of chapters, which concentrate on a bit of a family crisis in the life of computer genius and Dallas semi-mogul Dylan Reeves, threw me for a bit of a loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the jacket blurb of the book does a good job of setting the reader up for a potential romance between him and computer genius and Laguna Beach mega-mogul Tristan Wilder, the exquisitely handled introduction of Dylan's family--wife Teri, daughters Chloe and Cate, son Chad--has me shaking my head: Is this going to be one of those books where one MC, i.e., Dylan, is straight as a Texas arrow and we are getting set up for a sloppy seduction process by an admitted player in Tristan Wilder? This man Dylan Reeves is a completely devoted husband and father, and you could not even imagine where Ms. Alexander is going with this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until the last couple of pages of Chapter Two--wherein you discover that the title of the book is not only the name of Dylan's high-tech company, but also the definition of virtually every little plot twist that comes along. And, wow! Do they twist and turn--but with such deft segues, beautiful writing, and extraordinary sexual heat that you ultimately cannot put the darn book down.\n",
      "\n",
      "This one took my breath away in every way and in every chapter. It's fast-moving but not capricious, to the point but not nasty (well, one little incident is, but that's expected), mind bending but never outrageous in its premise that two alpha males just over the 35-year-old divide can blow their lives apart, but agree not to keep doing it, until there is no choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is never a choice in this book for continuing to have secrets--which is why the title of the book, the name of the company, and the plot twists are so cool to contemplate. No, the reason there is no choice is because Dylan Reeves is one of the great characters to have emerged from the M/M contemporary romance novels I have read (and there are many): He lives his life on integrity, except, of course, for one part of it which some might say qualifies him as a hypocrite, but not when you get to know him. He is walking honesty personified, and he manages to change people's lives with that honesty and integrity without leaving the other people, or the reader, raising skeptical eyebrows--a testament to Ms. Alexander's fertile imagination.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he has a wife who as a major positive player here may stun you at first, just as much as how a conflicted Tristan thrashes about trying to wrap his head around a man he cannot figure out, may take you aback at first. But when you get wrapped up in this tale, and this family, you will wonder how many other couples are in the same situation, and how few of them deal with it as this one does.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a book that will challenge you to guess when the next secret is disclosed, and how these people will deal with it. That Ms. Alexander will toss a nice little bomb in your path to each of those discoveries will rivet you to the page, this tale, and to these characters.\n",

He’s gone as far as he can with it and is ready to sell so the company can be taken to higher levels. Dylan’s company, his app, is called Secret.

Could these two have any more road blocks in their way? I loved watching the transformation of these two, especially Tristan. He was pretty much flummoxed by his feelings for Dylan. He just wasn’t a relationship guy, up to that point anyway. He found himself willing to do anything to win Dylan over, to give him a chance. Even pretending to be a jogger on a long run and almost killing himself in the process.\n",

      "I hate when this happens and thankfully it doesn't happen often. This book is going on my Everyone Like it But Me shelf. I went back to read some reviews after I finished the book and the positive response for this book from my GoodRead friends is overwhelming. I'm glad for that, especially since I'm such a big fan of Kindle Alexander's books and have given all of them 4 and/or 5 stars. But this one did not work for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, since the blurb indicated that one of the main characters was married with children, I wanted to know if there was cheating involved before I started reading it. I'm not one who absolutely read a book with cheating (one of my favorite books of all time is Cameron Dane's where cheating is a huge part of the plot) but I like to be prepared, especially since children were involved. I don't think it's a spoiler to tell you that there was here. Dylan and his wife Teri are together only for their kids and Teri is actually involved in a two year relationship with another man when Dylan meets Tristan.\n",

      "So, we have a deeply closeted man, Dylan Reeves, who is the creator of a social media app that all the big name companies what to acquire. He and his team travel to California to meet with the team at Wilder-Nation (described as a Google clone) and start negotiations to sell them Secret, the app that has millions of users. Tristan Wilder wants to acquire Secret at all costs after his own company's foray into the social media business has failed spectacularly. When Dylan and Tristan meet, there is an immediate attraction, but it thankfully isn't insta-lovey where they felt the need to rip each others clothes off in the stairwell. But we do hear both men's inner monologues and the attraction is there and mutual.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Tristan and his team give Dylan and his team a tour of the Wilder-Nation facilities, they take them out to wine and dine them and even visit a titty bar. Tristan can see that Dylan is uncomfortable and suggests the two of them leave the group and visit another establishment that would be more to their liking. This is where my problem with Tristan starts. Tristan is all promises to Dylan that he won't force him to do anything he doesn't want to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "See a pattern here? And all that is in the ! I felt that Tristan was pushy and had his own best interests in mind from the start. The next day, he finds he is enamored with Dylan that he offers the Secret team 20% then their asking price and all the stipulations they were asking for. On one condition: That Dylan agree to drive with him at sunset in his Ferrari and have a picnic on the beach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story continues with Dylan being apprehensive in his new relationship with Tristan (some reviews I read had readers annoyed with Dylan and his closeted ways, but I felt his feelings were warranted given the circumstances) and Tristan doing everything in his power to start a relationship. Flowers, Ferrari's, private dinners with Wolfgang Puck as their chef, elaborate hotel rooms, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, the boys do eventually get their HEA and all family members come to grips (incredibly quickly, if you ask me) with the changes in status and Secret is an astounding success. The end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tristan was just too relentless in his pursuit of Dylan and it kept me on edge throughout the entire book. I wasn't able to enjoy any of the sex because it felt just a touch dirty to me given Dylan's inexperience and Tristan's pushy tendencies. I personally , but for my one negative review, there are so YMMV. Either way, I do hope enjoy!\n"
