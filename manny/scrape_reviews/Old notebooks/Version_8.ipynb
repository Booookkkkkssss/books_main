I did not care for the narrator, and the child character Mattie was not a convincing three-year-old. However, there were some hot sex scenes. I was looking forward to the book two premise more than the others anyway, so I plan to continue with the series.\n",

DON'T GET ME WRONG IT'S NOT A BAD READ, CUTE STORYLINE, STEAMY SORT OF SEX SCENES WITH A LITTLE TOO MUCH ANGST FOR MY TASTE. IT JUST DIDN'T DO IT FOR ME I WAS SORTA BORED. SINCE THE PREQUEL WAS THE HOOK I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING MORE LIKE THE PREQUEL MADE ME WANT TO READ THE NEXT BOOK (I PRE-PAID FOR IT). IT WAS JUST SOMETHING FLAT ABOUT THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS PAIGE & MATTEO. REMINDED ME OF LOOKING FORWARD TO A GOOD MEAL THEN WHEN YOU TASTE IT THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING YA KNOW NOT ENOUGH PEPPER OR SALT MAYBE A LITTLE MORE SOMPTHIN', SOMPTHIN'? ;D\n",

She still wants Garett, Will’s twin, the man who eight years ago broke her heart and decided to join the military. She knows Garett is not the man for her, so instead she decides to seduce Will. She has everything planed. For one night she will be Will’s submissive at Serve, one of the biggest BDSM Clubs.

And if BDSM is not quite your cuppa, not to worry. Katee gives you just enough kink here to simply dip your feet in the pool.

Ms. Robert definitely treated and served her readers a delicious hot steamy read with this BDSM romance. If you are looking for a DOM that screams total alpha and a SUB that is discovering and exploring her sexuality then Mistaken By Fate is the book for you.\n",

Ridley and Garrett had a romantic history in the past. Soon Garrett found himself wanting more of Ridley. He was consumed with her and wanted more. With Garrett, Ridley found herself submitting to the man who awakened her sexuality. Together they found themselves igniting a bond that will awaken their hearts. And now that Garrett had a taste of Ridley, he will make sure not to make the same mistake twice and let Ridley go.\n",

And as for Ridley, she was a strong heroine. She was still able to voice her concerns and Garrett was able to ease her into the BDSM scene. They complimented each other well. So if are you looking for a book that will deliver HEA with a side of BDSM then I highly suggest you go read Mistaken By Fate because Katee Robert served the perfect balance of romance, steam and sexiness.\n",

      "A doggone good start to a new cozy series! Sisters, Daphne (a free-spirited pet sitter), and Piper (a veterinarian), live in the quaint, lakeside village of Sylvan Creek, PA, in a cozy farmhouse belonging to Piper. Daphne has a wise, meditative basset hound, aptly named Socrates, plus is fostering Artie, a feisty, teeny one-eared Chihuahua. After the suspicious death of a K9 trainer at the farm property; a handsome detective, one Jon Black, who's caught Daphne's interest, singles out Piper as his likeliest suspect. There are plenty of other notable frenemies, however, and Daphne and pals just have to narrow down motive, means, and opportunity. Great plot--To say the least, the killer reveal caught me by surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "A treat for animal lovers--a slow, easy, and entertaining way to wile away some downtime hours and relax. The characters are flawed and likeable, and I'll be looking forward to seeing them polished up and what's in store for them in future stories. There are also numerous laugh-out-loud moments throughout the book. Little Artie, the Chihuahua, has the larger dogs charmed and in the palms of his teeny tiny paws! LOL! Pet and people recipes included.\n",
      "\n",
      "I voluntarily reviewed an advanced copy of this book.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Dollycas’s Thoughts\n",
      "\n",
      "A Chocolate Lab names Axis, a Chihuahua named Artie, 3 huge rottweilers named Macduff, Iago and Hamlet and a Basset Hound named Socrates are all on a walk with pet sitter, Daphne Templeton and her sister Piper as the book starts out. Piper is a veterinarian and with the exception of her love life things are going well for her. Daphne lives with her rent free as she tries to get her new pet sitting business started. Piper’s ex Steve Beamus, is also part of this animal world in Sylvan Creek. He runs the Blue Ribbon K-9 Academy. They are all going to be together for a dog agility event at Piper’s farm. But when Steve is found dead in a unlikely place on Piper’s property, the event come to a barking halt and Piper is the first name on the list of prime suspects. Plus Steve’s dog Axis is missing. Daphne has no choice. She needs to find that dog and prove to Detective Jonathan Black that her sister had nothing to do with Steve’s murder. But she may be biting off a little more than she can chew.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a dog lover I was in love with the canine characters well before the end of chapter one. Socrates belongs to Daphne and she is fostering little Artie in hope of finding this unusual little dog a forever home. The rottweilers belong to a very well to do client. Axis, the victims dog is missing throughout most of the story and I was as anxious as Daphne to know that he was safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the 4 legged characters the story is filled with an great and unique cast of human characters. In addition to the sisters and the deceased, we meet Detective Jonathan Black. He is new in town, easy on the eyes and really doesn’t think Piper is guilty. Daphne, if she is honest with herself, would like to get to know the man better. Virginia Lockhart, owns the rottweilers with her politician husband but I think she loves those dogs more than she loves him. Mr. Peachy lives in a cottage on the farm and is sort of like a grandfather figure to the girls and helps out around the farm. We also meet some Sylvan Creek merchants. All the characters are well fleshed out and believable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story starts out at a good clip. The murder happens in the early chapters. Then the pace slows down almost too much but does pick up again. I usually read a book in two evenings. The slower pace gave me a good stopping point the first night and then I quickly finished it up on night two.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mystery itself had plenty of suspects and when we reached the big reveal it just knocked my socks off. I was absolutely, and totally surprised. The story also reached a happy place at the end for two of the doggies and that made the reader very happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "These characters were very engaging so I am excited for their next story. The Lucky Paws Petsitting Mysteries are off to an excellent start!\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I knew I had to request this book when I saw it on Netgalley because my Canine ADHD kicked in after seeing the basset hound on the cover. I'm glad I did because I found \"Death by Chocolate Lab\" to be a quick-paced cozy mystery and a strong start to a new series. Daphne is a pet sitter and since she has a Ph.D in philosophy, she doesn't quite see things as many around her would. She lives with her sister and kind of strikes me as a jack of all trades because although she pet sits, I don't think her life has a whole lot of focus. When her sister's ex Steve turns up dead and her sister Piper is the prime suspect, Daphne takes it upon herself to solve the mystery because she doesn't have faith that the new hot police detective in town, Detective Black, is looking in the right places.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked a lot of the characters in this book as well as the setting, and I believe both are crucial for a good cozy mystery. I found Daphne to be somewhat annoying at times because she is super presumptuous and makes a lot of hasty decisions and has to be bailed out tons. However, she grew on me at the book progressed and she didn't interfere with my overall reading enjoyment. I wasn't able to solve the mystery right away and there is a bunch of zany characters which I'm sure will make the future installments that much more fun to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now a word about the dogs. Daphne basically ends up collecting strays and fostering homeless pets throughout the book. Her basset Socrates is a permanent fixture, and she spends the whole book trying to find someone to adopt Archie, a misshapened Chihuahua. At one point, she is also caring for 3 Rottweilers as well as the Chocolate Lab mentioned in the title. Socrates is quite an aloof animal and his name definitely fits him. He doesn't get shaken up or excited about too many things and he is a nice juxtaposition for Daphne.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoyed reading this and look forward to future installments. If you like animals in your cozy mystery series, than don't pass this one up.\n",

      "I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, this was cute, but honestly, the best thing about it were the dogs, especially Artie, who has the biggest personality. The first book in the Lucky Paws Petsitting series is a quick read, and Daphne Templeton is a pet lover who ends up investigating a murder. Since this didn't grab my attention, I may pass on the next book. Overall, I liked it though. Readers of cozies may like this if they're looking for something on the light side.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A good start to a new series.\n",
      "\n",
      "I very much enjoyed DEATH BY CHOCOLATE LAB during the first several chapters. It was a very quick read, (I love short chapters in a book), and I found myself flying through the pages, learning about protagonist Daphne Templeton, and her sister Piper, Daphne’s petsitting business Lucky Paws (thus the name of the series), and meeting canine characters, Socrates and Artie, as well as a few townsfolk.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I mentioned above, during the first eight or so chapters, things moved rather swiftly, making it hard for me to put the book down. However, there were slow scenes further into the story that, honestly, if the chapters had been long ones, I would have found it hard to get through them. I know most authors have a word count that must be observed, (depending on the publisher), but there were parts of the book that would have been better if they had been trimmed back.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that being said, I think author Bethany Blake can make the Lucky Paws Mysteries into a great series. She has created some likeable characters that I look forward to seeing grow as she continues to flesh them out, and her cast of pups already have a place in my heart. Blake is a good writer, and I very much want to read the next in the series when it releases.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are a lover of adorable dogs, I suggest you give DEATH BY CHOCOLATE LAB a try. If you do, be sure to check out the back of the book for recipes for dogs and humans (though some of the dog recipes sounded like something I’d eat), and read an excerpt for book two the Lucky Paws Petsitting Mysteries, DIAL MEOW FOR MURDER.\n",

      "5+ stars – Vampire/Historical Romance\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my favorite book in the extraordinary Brotherhood of the Blood vampire historical romance series. The series has a unique take on vampire mythology, centering on six soldiers who became vampires by drinking from an ancient chalice infused with the essence of Lilith. Taken by the Night focuses on the vampire Saint’s pursuit of a Jack the Ripper style killer in London and his relationship with the strong, feisty heroine Ivy. I LOVED the vampire Saint...he is dark, rogue, sexy, cocky, sweet, and romantic. The romance between Saint and Ivy is steamy and definitely my favorite of the series. This is a fantastic, romantic read. I loved this book and love the series!\n",

      "\n",
      "The 3rd installment of the Brotherhood of Blood series focuses on Saint, a skilled thief and renowned ladies man, as he works together with Ivy Dearing, the daughter of a high-end madam, to investigate a series of Ripper-like murders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, despite the intriguing premise and original explanation for the Jack the Ripper case, Saint and Ivy's story falls flat. The main reason is the complete lack of chemistry between the romantic leads. This is compounded by the fact that there is something distasteful about an immortal vampire becoming sexually attracted to the woman he has known from birth and whom he has watched mature from childhood into adulthood over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The actual murder investigation is enjoyable overall even though the identity of the killer is obvious from the start and the twists and turns are predictable albeit quite suspenseful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ongoing arc revolving around the machinations of the Order of the Silver Palm continues, and it will be interesting to see how it all plays out when the various members of the Brotherhood ultimately meet up to face the Order, whose ultimate agenda has yet to be clearly established.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, not the best in the series, but the hints at Reign's story have potential.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Yeah, I skipped about 100 pages between the halfway point & the climax, but whatever. I'm still counting it as finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Book 1 isn't the most marvelous thing ever, but at least it's a mildly enjoyable story with a plucky, likable heroine & gruff, likable hero. This one...nope. The hero is a walking cliché (seriously; all his dialogue & backstory is in 100% accordance with the Romantic Vampire Hero template) & the heroine is a judgmental shrew. A perpetual bitch. A continual nag. However you choose to describe that type, she's it. :P Every single thing Saint says is insulting because she's a woman, because he doesn't respect her, because he doesn't see her, because he's smothering her, because he's neglecting her, because he's a vampire, because he's rude, because he's polite, because he won't screw her, because he wants to screw her...STFU, woman!\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a shame, really. I like how Ivy is a tableau photographer (sort of Julia Margaret Cameron for whores), & I also like her backstory about growing up in the Maison Rouge, etc...but overall she's a singularly juvenile, annoying heroine. Saint isn't anything special, but he certainly deserves better than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue: the plot is uber-predictable (one exception being how the first Ripper was a failed acolyte of the Silver Palm...that was a good tidbit) & the villains are a pack of pathetic, cartoony loons straight out of Scooby Doo.\n",
      "\n",
      "...And did I mention that it's boring? SO INCREDIBLY BORING. Nothing happens until the last quarter. Until that point it's a circle-jerk of Ivy & Saint mooning over each other whilst stumbling across the corpses of Ivy's friends & somehow missing the most bloody obvious villain who ever took up residence in a Victorian-era paranormal. 🙄\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway. I'm officially done with this series.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Ooohhh...I like this better than the last one! This story line was really good. Saint and Ivy were perfect for each other, a complimentary couple. I liked seeing Saint not so tough as most male characters are portrayed. He was a more sensitive vampire who believed and desired love and not afraid to admit it. He didn't fight it either. I like the change of character. I was really hoping for a connection from the last book to be here and was disappointed when it didn't come to pass but hinted at the end of maybe in another book it would. Can't tell you what that would be. Must read the books! lol Also made me really sink into the series plot line and now must continue series to see where it all leads. I could have stopped with the last but this book seals the deal to continue!\n",

      "Sin Sweetly With Saint\n",
      "Ivy Dearing is a modern woman of twenty-seven and there isn't much in life that surprises her, certainly nothing regarding relations between a man and a woman. As the daughter of the madam of Maison Rouge, an eminent house of prostitution in London, she's grown up knowing more than the average young lady about what goes on between the genders. As the daughter of a woman cast aside by a married lover and forced to rely on the good nature of the vampire Saint, she's familiar with the vampires that the Maison Rouge protects and provides for - in every way - and disbelieving in the concept of love. Lust she understands. Love is a farce perpetrated on the feeble minded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The year is 1899 and Ivy has lost two dear friends to the blade of a butcher who did unspeakable things to them...took unspeakable things from them. She's desperate for help to catch a killer, as the coppers of London don't put themselves out much for a couple of dead prostitutes. When Saint shows up at the Maison Rouge for the first time in a decade, Ivy takes it upon herself to remind him of all the house has done for him and his brethren over the years and demand his help to stop a madman before more fall under his blade.\n",
      "\n",
      "For over six hundred years Saint has been thief, reprobate, killer, and lover of women, but his actions have toned down considerably since the death of his beloved Marta twenty-five years ago. He goes to Maison Rouge to visit old friends and to rest for a bit. He's poleaxed by the vision that is Ivy Dearing, the challenging and impertinent chit. Feeling all of his immortal years bearing heavily on him as he realizes the child of seventeen he'd last seen a decade ago is a child no more, he can't stop thinking about her...wanting her. She challenges his honor and he vows to catch a killer for her. She challenges the notion of love...and he vows to love her forever. And forever for his kind is a very long time indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite not being the biggest fan of historical fiction of any sort, I have to admit, 's Brotherhood of The Blood series has really grown on me. I wasn't overly fond of the first, but I enjoyed the second very much, and with Saint and Ivy's story, I'm firmly a fan...even though I preferred the characters in the previous book just a bit more.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't speak intelligently on the historical accuracy of the dialogue or the settings, but I can say that Smith can blend a gruesome murder mystery with a sensual romance and grace her readers with a well-paced plot that's ripe with style and full of emotion. I enjoyed the sense of history, regardless of whether it was historically accurate, and I really loved how Smith not only addressed the parallels between the murderer in the book and the infamous killer Jack the Ripper, but incorporated those parallels into the backstory and plot. I thought that was particularly well done. So too Smith's vampire mythos, which I've enjoyed from the beginning of the series. There's a plethora of vampire-themed series out there, and I've read lots of them, and I think the history of the Brotherhood of The Blood combined with the historical setting and the evolution of the individual characters in each book has provided just enough of a twist to the mythos to give it a unique, imaginative, and fresh feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't say I was totally thrilled with Ivy as a character. I appreciated her independence and intelligence, and I loved her profession/art, but found her personality grating when things didn't go her way and frustratingly obtuse when it came to her feelings. Saint, on the other hand, was very appealing. I liked the turnabout of having Saint as the romantic and believer in love and Ivy the doubter who is willing to embrace her lust but keeps her heart disengaged, but I found Ivy's belligerent refusal to even entertain the notion of love wore on my patience after a while, and the resolution of that seemed oddly placed and a bit peculiar.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was an odd time jump towards the conclusion of the book that I wish had developed differently, but I was very pleased with the tie-in to the events of and conclusion in and very much look forward to seeing where the series goes from here. I'm a fan of this series, a fan of 's unique and stylistic writing, and a huge fan of the brothers themselves. I hope to see a book that puts all the brothers and their women together to deal with the Order of the Silver Palm. That's just a personal dream, though. I'm sure I'll enjoy however this series develops.\n",

      "5+ stars – Vampire/Historical Romance\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my favorite book in the extraordinary Brotherhood of the Blood vampire historical romance series. The series has a unique take on vampire mythology, centering on six soldiers who became vampires by drinking from an ancient chalice infused with the essence of Lilith. Taken by the Night focuses on the vampire Saint’s pursuit of a Jack the Ripper style killer in London and his relationship with the strong, feisty heroine Ivy. I LOVED the vampire Saint...he is dark, rogue, sexy, cocky, sweet, and romantic. The romance between Saint and Ivy is steamy and definitely my favorite of the series. This is a fantastic, romantic read. I loved this book and love the series!\n",

      "The 3rd installment of the Brotherhood of Blood series focuses on Saint, a skilled thief and renowned ladies man, as he works together with Ivy Dearing, the daughter of a high-end madam, to investigate a series of Ripper-like murders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, despite the intriguing premise and original explanation for the Jack the Ripper case, Saint and Ivy's story falls flat. The main reason is the complete lack of chemistry between the romantic leads. This is compounded by the fact that there is something distasteful about an immortal vampire becoming sexually attracted to the woman he has known from birth and whom he has watched mature from childhood into adulthood over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The actual murder investigation is enjoyable overall even though the identity of the killer is obvious from the start and the twists and turns are predictable albeit quite suspenseful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ongoing arc revolving around the machinations of the Order of the Silver Palm continues, and it will be interesting to see how it all plays out when the various members of the Brotherhood ultimately meet up to face the Order, whose ultimate agenda has yet to be clearly established.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, not the best in the series, but the hints at Reign's story have potential.\n",

      "Yeah, I skipped about 100 pages between the halfway point & the climax, but whatever. I'm still counting it as finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Book 1 isn't the most marvelous thing ever, but at least it's a mildly enjoyable story with a plucky, likable heroine & gruff, likable hero. This one...nope. The hero is a walking cliché (seriously; all his dialogue & backstory is in 100% accordance with the Romantic Vampire Hero template) & the heroine is a judgmental shrew. A perpetual bitch. A continual nag. However you choose to describe that type, she's it. :P Every single thing Saint says is insulting because she's a woman, because he doesn't respect her, because he doesn't see her, because he's smothering her, because he's neglecting her, because he's a vampire, because he's rude, because he's polite, because he won't screw her, because he wants to screw her...STFU, woman!\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a shame, really. I like how Ivy is a tableau photographer (sort of Julia Margaret Cameron for whores), & I also like her backstory about growing up in the Maison Rouge, etc...but overall she's a singularly juvenile, annoying heroine. Saint isn't anything special, but he certainly deserves better than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue: the plot is uber-predictable (one exception being how the first Ripper was a failed acolyte of the Silver Palm...that was a good tidbit) & the villains are a pack of pathetic, cartoony loons straight out of Scooby Doo.\n",
      "\n",
      "...And did I mention that it's boring? SO INCREDIBLY BORING. Nothing happens until the last quarter. Until that point it's a circle-jerk of Ivy & Saint mooning over each other whilst stumbling across the corpses of Ivy's friends & somehow missing the most bloody obvious villain who ever took up residence in a Victorian-era paranormal. 🙄\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Ooohhh...I like this better than the last one! This story line was really good. Saint and Ivy were perfect for each other, a complimentary couple. I liked seeing Saint not so tough as most male characters are portrayed. He was a more sensitive vampire who believed and desired love and not afraid to admit it. He didn't fight it either. I like the change of character. I was really hoping for a connection from the last book to be here and was disappointed when it didn't come to pass but hinted at the end of maybe in another book it would. Can't tell you what that would be. Must read the books! lol Also made me really sink into the series plot line and now must continue series to see where it all leads. I could have stopped with the last but this book seals the deal to continue!\n",

      "Sin Sweetly With Saint\n",
      "Ivy Dearing is a modern woman of twenty-seven and there isn't much in life that surprises her, certainly nothing regarding relations between a man and a woman. As the daughter of the madam of Maison Rouge, an eminent house of prostitution in London, she's grown up knowing more than the average young lady about what goes on between the genders. As the daughter of a woman cast aside by a married lover and forced to rely on the good nature of the vampire Saint, she's familiar with the vampires that the Maison Rouge protects and provides for - in every way - and disbelieving in the concept of love. Lust she understands. Love is a farce perpetrated on the feeble minded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The year is 1899 and Ivy has lost two dear friends to the blade of a butcher who did unspeakable things to them...took unspeakable things from them. She's desperate for help to catch a killer, as the coppers of London don't put themselves out much for a couple of dead prostitutes. When Saint shows up at the Maison Rouge for the first time in a decade, Ivy takes it upon herself to remind him of all the house has done for him and his brethren over the years and demand his help to stop a madman before more fall under his blade.\n",
      "\n",
      "For over six hundred years Saint has been thief, reprobate, killer, and lover of women, but his actions have toned down considerably since the death of his beloved Marta twenty-five years ago. He goes to Maison Rouge to visit old friends and to rest for a bit. He's poleaxed by the vision that is Ivy Dearing, the challenging and impertinent chit. Feeling all of his immortal years bearing heavily on him as he realizes the child of seventeen he'd last seen a decade ago is a child no more, he can't stop thinking about her...wanting her. She challenges his honor and he vows to catch a killer for her. She challenges the notion of love...and he vows to love her forever. And forever for his kind is a very long time indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite not being the biggest fan of historical fiction of any sort, I have to admit, 's Brotherhood of The Blood series has really grown on me. I wasn't overly fond of the first, but I enjoyed the second very much, and with Saint and Ivy's story, I'm firmly a fan...even though I preferred the characters in the previous book just a bit more.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't speak intelligently on the historical accuracy of the dialogue or the settings, but I can say that Smith can blend a gruesome murder mystery with a sensual romance and grace her readers with a well-paced plot that's ripe with style and full of emotion. I enjoyed the sense of history, regardless of whether it was historically accurate, and I really loved how Smith not only addressed the parallels between the murderer in the book and the infamous killer Jack the Ripper, but incorporated those parallels into the backstory and plot. I thought that was particularly well done. So too Smith's vampire mythos, which I've enjoyed from the beginning of the series. There's a plethora of vampire-themed series out there, and I've read lots of them, and I think the history of the Brotherhood of The Blood combined with the historical setting and the evolution of the individual characters in each book has provided just enough of a twist to the mythos to give it a unique, imaginative, and fresh feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't say I was totally thrilled with Ivy as a character. I appreciated her independence and intelligence, and I loved her profession/art, but found her personality grating when things didn't go her way and frustratingly obtuse when it came to her feelings. Saint, on the other hand, was very appealing. I liked the turnabout of having Saint as the romantic and believer in love and Ivy the doubter who is willing to embrace her lust but keeps her heart disengaged, but I found Ivy's belligerent refusal to even entertain the notion of love wore on my patience after a while, and the resolution of that seemed oddly placed and a bit peculiar.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was an odd time jump towards the conclusion of the book that I wish had developed differently, but I was very pleased with the tie-in to the events of and conclusion in and very much look forward to seeing where the series goes from here. I'm a fan of this series, a fan of 's unique and stylistic writing, and a huge fan of the brothers themselves. I hope to see a book that puts all the brothers and their women together to deal with the Order of the Silver Palm. That's just a personal dream, though. I'm sure I'll enjoy however this series develops.\n",

      "\n",
      "I love this series, and I loved this couple - I was looking forward to their story, and while I definitely enjoyed it, there was more angst than I felt necessary. There are some allusions and ties to book 1 in this series, so I would recommend reading Accidentally Compromising the Duke before reading this one for some more background on this couple and their history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Evie Chesterfield has been in love with Richard Maitland since he happened upon her casting up her accounts at a party she was not supposed to be attending as she was not yet of age. Not only did Richard, her older brother's good friend and the second son of a duke, keep her confidences, he also gave her advice on how to avoid being married off to an older gentleman that her mother has been pushing on her to secure at her coming out party happening the very next day on her 16th birthday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evie has no desire to be married - she is much too young and she believes in love and wants to find it before she makes that kind of commitment. But over the next few years, Evie and Richard become close friends, and they seek each other's consult when they have no one else they can talk to about things. Before long, Evie realizes she has fallen head over heels in love with Richard, but she knows he has vowed to never marry after his former fiancee broke his heart years earlier. When her mother schemes to marry Evie off to the Duke of Wolverton (known to all in the ton as the \"Mad Duke\") at a house party that they are hosting, Evie betrays her best friend Adeline by setting her up to be compromised by the duke so that he will have to call off their betrothal plans to wed Adeline instead (this plot unfolds in book 1 mentioned above). Fortunately for all, the duke and Adeline fall in love, but when Evie's mother tells her that their family is falling into financial ruin, Evie know she is running out of time before she is forced to wed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Richard Maitland became enchanted with Evie from the moment he met her, and over the years, they have become friends and confidants. In fact, Evie is who he turns to when he returns from war and grieves the loss of his older brother. And Evie is also who Richard turns to when he learns he is a father, and the mother of his child (the fiancee that jilted him years earlier) abandoned their daughter Emily at a baby farm. Evie supports his decision to find Emily and claim her regardless of her birth status, even when the rest of the ton, including his own family, turn against him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of the situation he found Emily in and the circumstances of the many other children he has since rescued, Richard is equally determined to use his seat at the table as the Marquess of Westfall (set to inherit the dukedom as a result of his brother's untimely death) to take on the establishment that only allows the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer. His interactions with his \"peers\" and their disdain for people who are not responsible for their impoverished conditions has soured Richard towards the ton to the extent that he no longer socializes with them nor cares what they think of him. Though he has always had strong feelings for Evie, she has been the darling of the ton since her coming out, and he knows that his standing in society would drag her down. He also isn't certain that she could ever accept his daughter and openly embrace her in society. But when Evie tells him that she must marry, will Richard truly be able to let her go? Can Richard give Evie a chance to accept him for who he is and his daughter as her own? And when they are caught in a compromising position, will Richard step up to the plate?\n",
      "\n",
      "What I liked:\n",
      "--- In the earlier books of the series, I always liked Richard, but Evie was so selfish in the first book setting her best friend up like that... I didn't like her much at all; this book gave me much more insight and demonstrated growth, so I found both main characters likeable in this story\n",
      "--- The characters from book 1 were in this one quite a bit which was nice bc I enjoyed their story\n",
      "--- The story dealt with the disparity between the rich and the poor in this time period, which is often not a focus in HRs, so it was nice to see a champion for this cause\n",
      "--- Once we GOT to the steamy goodness, it was delish\n",
      "\n",
      "What I didn't like as much:\n",
      "--- FFS Richard - get over yourself! While I liked that he was passionate about his daughter and making positive changes in the world, he was WAY TOO STUBBORN about things with Evie, and he made too many assumptions - made me crazy and I felt like it went too far beyond what would be considered reasonable (thus, my too much angst rating); and I HATE when\n",
      "\n",
      "--- SLOW BURN - I really could have used a little more much sooner bc there was already a relationship there between the two, so there wasn't much need for all of the lead up time\n",

      "Lady Evie Gladstone had been friends with Marquess of Westfall, Richard since she was sixteen and he twenty-four. Richard was Evie's brother friend first but the two bonded and had a special connection over the years. As the years passed their feelings grew and became deeper. Evie came to love Richard and dreamed of being his wife. But Richard had a cynical view of love, he was hurt and betrayed by a woman in his past that he thought he loved and would marry. He was attracted too Evie and cared deeply for her. Richard cherished their friendship but knew that there was a line/boundary that he couldn't cross with her. Plus she was too good, sweet and proper for him. Richard went off to war and Evie became the diamond of the ton.\n",
      "\n",
      "As years pass they correspond and continue their friendship. One day Richard learns he has a daughter from the woman who betray him. He does something that is so outrageous and against what the ton would ever accept, he acknowledges his daughter and brings her to his home to raise her.\n",
      "\n",
      "What transpires is Richard fighting his attraction to Evie and believing she would never accept his daughter. Even though Richard cares for her he believes/thinks Evie is somewhat of a snob and the approval and acceptance of the ton is most important to her. Evie in the mean time struggles to understand what she believes/stands up for opposed to the tons and her family. She learns that Richard might marry for his daughter sake, so she can have a Mother figure in her life. Evie is hurt, angry and determined to be that wife to Richard and mother to his daughter. She devises a plan, she asks Richard to teach her how to seduce and entice someone she cares for. Richard struggles with the notion of Evie with someone else but yet can't resist her or the temptation of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story takes off from there with the ebb and flow of their acceptance for each other, communication and development of a deeper relationship. There was misunderstandings, hurt but yet enlightenment of their true feelings and growth of their character.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found this not to be a true Regency fiction, with the customs and restrictions of the era/time. More a modern version of a \"Historical\" (if there is such a thing 😬). Not too much Historical accuracy. But I did find it entertaining and engaging read. The characters grew in depth and the plot was engrossing. The time span of when they were not together at times seemed lengthy, but not so much that it took away from the story.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I was curious about this couple since they’ve both made small appearances in the first two books of the series. Neither had particular good traits. Evie made a selfish decision and sacrificed a friend to save herself from an unwanted marriage and Richard was cold and blatantly rude to everyone he came across. These two have been friends for 6 yrs. Both must get married, however Evie only wants to marry Richard and Richard doesn’t want to taint Evie with his scandalous reputation. Evie played her part well. She was outspoken and stood firm in her desire. Richard had lots to overcome and had to soften his heart to see clearly. He had a special reserved soft side for Evie, his daughter and his sister. His other redeeming quality was his plight to care for the poor, ignored and underserved. I enjoyed how this book really elaborated on both of their character traits and allowed the reader to get a good understanding of each of them and the make sense of their past decisions. it was written very well. Lots of drama and angst, hot steamy scenes and lots of tug and pull.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I am so thrilled for Evie and Westfall’s book to be out in the world. I got dozens upon dozens of emails/FB messages from readers asking about their story.

      "\n",
      "We know quite a bit about Richard, Lord Westfall and Lady Evelyn from the first two books of the series. He's the jaded, scandal-ridden man who had the audacity to claim his bastard daughter, and she's the society sweetheart who loves him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the two, she sounds like the boring one, doesn't she? Wrong. I loved Evie. She was sweet and loyal, yet she had some great spunk.\n",
      "She had some fantastic moments in this book that I won't spoil for you, but just know that she did what needed to be done and that it often left me with a huge smile on my face.\n",
      "But don't think that I'm implying that Richard was boring. He wasn't. His love for his daughter and his crusade to help the impoverished were heartwarming, and contrasted sharply with his disdain for the hypocritical . And he had a intense streak a mile wide...\n",
      "...that would soften around Evie to make this book incredibly swoon worthy at times.\n",

      "Sean Hayward was successful and wealthy. As a criminologist, his job was bleak and stressful. But he never had to worry about feeling down because he had his four best friends living under one roof to pick him up if he ever needed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The five of them were content but something still wasn't enough. They needed not only a housekeeper but also someone who would attend to their sexual needs. Sascha Dubois was the perfect candidate willing to fill both roles. But their long term plan might not necessarily match hers.\n",

      "Sean's a genius. Not that he brags about it. An eminent criminologist, he rules his particular roost. More than just at work. At home too.\n",
      "See, back in college, Sean met four other guys. All geniuses, crazy prodigies who were going to set the world alight with their brilliance...\n",

      "I was most definitely Charmed by Them.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was an unexpected delight. It was effervescent and fun, with entirely likable characters and a sweet story. I utterly adored Devon - one of the most interesting, unusual, and adorably sweet love interests I have read in a long long time. Actually, I loved what I saw of all the men, and I hope to learn more. In this first episode, most of them are not yet fully fleshed out. But they show a lot of promise!\n",
      "\n",
      "The main character, Sascha, is also delightful. Strangely for all the RH's I have read in recent months, she was not abused, wasn't fighting miles of emotional angst to get to happy, she was just intelligent and fun and very self-aware and self-confident. A wonderful surprise!\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, all of the characters were outside the norm. It was almost role reversal in some ways - a female MC who was self-confident and strong (without snark or bitchiness or dominance), and knew what she wanted and went after it. Made the first moves. And male love interests who seemed very in touch with their emotions and feelings, were crazy intelligent and interesting, yet didn't appear to surrender their sexy swagger when it came right down to it.\n",

      "My one quibble? A hell of a cliffhanger. And I hate cliffies.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "What can I say, Kathryn Le Veque never fails to deliver a fantastic medieval book full of adventure, romance and friends that would die for you. Characters and story come alive in her books and this one is just fantastic a real page turner. A Must read!\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Prepare to enter a world of medieval intrigue with a fearless knight, part of a group named the The Unholy Trinity - The Executioner Knights, who after the Crusades became mercenaries. That is exactly what they are and the hero, Sir Maxton of Loxbeare is the leader and possibly the most ruthless. Sent on a mission to find the men who seek to assassinate the new King John of England, he will stop at nothing.\n",
      "That is until he comes upon Lady Andressa, who has been living in a convent, sent there by her aunt, who is stealing her inheritance. She may be the key to to helping him find the men he is looking for and she finds herself greatly attracted to him. A man with no softness or can he have strong feelings for Andie?\n",
      "Filled with suspense, danger and strong emotions that you can feel through the characters, once you start this story you will not be able to stop. Kathryn LeVeque is a master at creating a story that is filled with strong heroes and heroines of legendary proportions that take you through history as never before.\n",
      "A remarkable debut of the Executioner Knights series. Cannot wait for the next.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Kathryn Le Veque never ceases to amaze me. How she unfailingly comes up with such outstanding stories is a mystery to me. But, I am always left with a big smile on my face with each and every book she writes. Oh, the ride along the way is undoubtedly going to be filled with angst, intense emotion, intrigue, sometimes tears and laughter, incredible battle scenes, camaraderie, family and loyalty (just to name a few). But the end result is always the same. I always say \"geez, that was SO good!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was first introduced to \"the Unholy Trinity\" in Ms. Le Veque's \"Lord of Winter.\" I remember thinking at the time that she just had to write individual books about the three intriguing lethal loners who worked so well as a team. \"By the Unholy Hand\" is Sir Maxton of Loxbeare's book. It is an off-the-charts winner and a fabulous start to this new series. There are a lot of puzzle pieces to this tale, with two fabulous, unusual characters taking the lead. Just fabulous!\n",
      "\n",
      "The other \"Executioner Knights\" are Kress de Rhydian and Archilles de Dere. To say I cannot wait for their stories would be an understatement. Sigh. ;)\n",

      "❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️\n",
      "💋Maxton and Andressa , what a team , and a great start to what looks to be a brilliant series.\n",
      "These two are awesome.\n",
      "He’s tougher than most , a man who knows no fear ,unless Andie is hurt or in trouble, he has seen and done it all , is not afraid to get in there and get the job done , and is in his element when getting Bric McRohans back up .\n",
      "She is meek , mild , and helpful, a lovely sweet young lady .\n",
      "But when she is called to defend and protect her King she is a veritable whirlwind, and doesn’t mind getting imaginative with anything to hand to protect herself .\n",
      "Great book and excellent story.\n",
      "Loved the meeting of all the great minds from LeVeque World , especially Max and Bric , so good .\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Sir Maxton of Loxbeare is summoned by William Marshall of a job to stop the killing of King John from the Pope which could throw all of England into turmoil; Maxton and his three other friends known as the Executioner knights takes the job. Maxton and his friends must find out who wants John dead. The job definitely isn’t easy and could cost Maxton everything including his life but he is willing to try. As Maxton is trying to figure out the mystery he meets the hungry starving pledge, Lady Andressa du Bose. Maxton feels drawn to Andressa and decides to help her. In doing so Maxton and Andressa form a sort of friendship and Andressa for some reason comes to trust Maxton. As Maxton gets to know Andressa he finds where she stays St. Blitha-holds some very strange secrets, women also disappear and cruel women are nuns. Maxton thinks there has to be a connection to the starving pledges, the disappearing women, the nuns, the Pope and the plot to kill John isn’t there or is Maxton willing to put his reputation on the line by accusing the wrong people?\n",
      "What a truly amazing book this is! The story is crammed full of mystery, secrets, spies and a sweet romance thrown in. The story is so intricate and wonderful; filled with quite a bit of action never slowing down keeping one glued until the very last page! Sure the story did start off slow but really built up into a pleasing climax that would satisfy anyone! Ms. Kathryn Le Veque just knows how to tell a fantastic tale weaving fictional and non-fictional characters in a way that is pure genius! Even some previous characters from other books made an appearance heightening the story but never taking center stage. Maxton the quiet, brooding, deadly intelligent knight is stealthy and not afraid of killing anyone that will get in his way. Maxton also has a hidden sweet compassionate side that is hard to resist, no wonder Andressa fell for him! He’s really a good guy even with his horrid reputation but there is a redeeming quality about him that just because he is supposed to be bad he isn’t really. Andressa the starving witty heroine is also great too! Sure at first she isn’t portrayed in the best light but when her circumstances come to light then she becomes a winning fighting woman that still manages to see the good in Maxton. This book definitely has staying power that waiting for the other stories of the executioner knights will be well worth the wait!\n",

It is dry, too simple, boring, etc. Despite all this I have to say she is one of my favorite poets. She is no Langston Hughes, not a Maya Angelou, or Sylvia Plath but I could read poem after poem. Is the way she uses her verse sparse simplicity? Perhaps. Is it the way she deals so precisely with the subject matter of each of her poems? That could be. Far be it from me to explain, but her poems keep me wanting to read another one, and since this is just her first volume (published posthumously) I will definitely be reviewing volume 2 as well.\n",

      "This book was still good, and I read it super fast, but there are a few questions that I really need answers for at this point. I wish we knew a bit more about what Sienna's life in the human world was like, who Jordan is to her, what happened in her early life that was so traumatic, etc. Her life keeps being referenced but we have gotten zero explanation (was she a stripper? did her parents die in some accident? Jordan and her lived together place to place?). Also, I was confused whether Jordan is supposed to be her best friend around her age or like a little brother figure because he seemed to act and be treated like a 5-year-old and they kept calling him \"the boy,\" but then Dominic was super jealous when Sienna kissed his cheek?\n",
      "\n",
      "I still love Dominic, Will, the Duchess, and Lochlin. Bee was kinda a bee (bitch) in this book, and I don't really like her anymore. Green is not a cute color on you, Bee. Diana was an interesting character--I haven't made up my mind about her. I was not surprised at all about the betrayer; that betrayal was obviously coming. I was annoyed throughout their entire plot planning meetings because their plan was obviously not going to work, and as the reader, it was frustrating to read long paragraphs of plotting a stupid plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a little annoyed that we are 2 books into this series and still not any closer to finding out what Sienna is or what exactly the extent of her powers are. The Duchess said in the 1st book that she knew what Sienna is, so why don't they just ask her for answers instead of going through this charade with the oracle? Also, are we ever going to learn Sienna's real name? I'm just getting impatient and we need some answers before the author starts opening up more questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will continue this series because I really like the world and the main couple, but I need some answers to things that have been danced around throughout books 1 and 2. I'm worried that the author has forgotten some of the plot points or background that she referenced early on that she has yet to answer/elaborate on.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I was even more hooked on book 2 than I was book 1! Absolutely obsessed. It’s a great plot with fast pacing and the perfect amount of spice 😍\n",

      "Dying for book 3 already!\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I know we’re always talking about our book boyfriends, but you ever get hooked on an amazing leading lady? I certainly have a decent list of my favorites and I’m absolutely adding Sienna to it! @ Alpha Territories series sucked me in with the first chapter and I’ve been clamoring for more ever since!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hunted By Fate is book two and we pick up right where we left off … knee deep in snow and a giant pile of trouble! Sienna is on the run with one wounded vampire in tow, a murderous vampire on her heels, and the vampire who stole her heart stuck with the enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So where does she turn? To the werewolves! And if she doesn’t have enough to juggle, she’s still trying to track down her brother while uncovering some truths about herself. Certainly no shortage of stuff on her plate and in spite of it all, Sienna is fierce, witty, compassionate, smart, and loyal. See, definite top leading lady material!!\n",
      "\n",
      "But let’s not forget about our favorite vamp, Dominic, aka The General. He’s in an impossible position between family and the woman he’s not supposed to care for. Some of my favorite scenes were of him and Sienna, especially because we finally got some awesome steam in this book!\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no shortage of intriguing revelations in this book, which adds more to my list of questions. But that ending … let the countdown to book three begin 😏\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Ok, so I thought book one was OK. It gave a good background on Sienna, how she got to the vamp lands, what her purpose was, and an intro to her weird powers and connection to The General. We got a good insight into Dominic’s motivations and duty, his reasoning behind steering clear of Sienna, and his love for his country and brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Skip to book two. There’s a weird opening “prologue” that vaguely connects to one phrase the Duchess uses in book one, but from there, things go off the rails. Sienna and Dominic really don’t have much interaction in book 1, so there is a bunch of misunderstanding/miscommunication and very little talking between the two characters. As the book progresses, there is this unspoken devotion and love that is supposed to have developed between Sienna and Dominic that is just not believable, seeing as they spend most of the two books apart and never talking to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also a bunch of unexplained “knowledge?” about Siennas powers and her purpose, but again, there is little foreshadowing to tie these discoveries to, making things feel disjointed and contrived.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationship between Sienna and Jordan (who apparently got kicked in the head by a horse or something equivalent?) and Bee (who is best friends with Sienna after being her maid but then wants nothing to do with her?) are very confusing and hot/cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I think the author didn’t know where to take the book after the first one, and doesn’t have a clear idea of where the story is going.\n",
      "\n",
      "DNF at 87% after ANOTHER unexplained “plot twist” is thrown in. I don’t plan to read the next book in the series.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I find it absolutely amazing that the prologue of this book was a portend to the final chapter!! A genius way to show how this wonderful word circles back around!\n",
      "\n",
      "In this installment we meet up with Sienna as she leaves the vampire territory for wolf territory at breakneck speeds! Of course this is where things begin to go wrong as well. Bloodworms are spreading quicker than the news of King Sterling’s death, can they be outrun?!\n",
      "Even once Sienna, Bee, and Will make it to wolf territory it doesn’t mean they are welcome with open arms. Danger follows Sienna everywhere she goes and this territory is no different. The more Sienna’s life is in danger the more her powers seem to spark leaving everyone, including herself, wondering just what she is.\n",
      "The heartbreak and the betrayal continue for Sienna and for her friends. I love every single one of these characters, but especially Sienna and Bree!\n",
      "I absolutely cannot wait to read the next installment, I am 100% invested!\n",

      "\"As we live through the Anthropocene, our current epoch of human-made disaster, a new book, Elvia Wilk’s 'Death by Landscape,' argues compellingly that giving more space to the weird can help us reconsider our relationships to nature—and, even in the face of institutional inertia, exercise greater responsibility to each other.\" — Michael Friedrich\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I feel like this is the type of book one might appreciate if you wanted to feel like an intellectual about the state of the world without having to do very much work about what that actually means. Much of my issues with this book come from the fact that Wilk clearly knows how to use the language of progressivism, yet many of the ideas she puts forth (particularly in Plants) echo ecofascist talking points. She generalizes humanity's relationship with nature as purely negative and extractive over and over again. She follows this up by saying maybe it would be good for the Earth if humanity vanished. Now, this line of reasoning is unfortunately very common. If you don't spend much time reading intersectional environmental literature, it's easy to fall into the idea that all people, everywhere, are bad for nature. Wilk provided very little in the way to counteract this troubled reasoning, and essentially advocated we should all just accept our inevitable change/death. It irks me that someone who supposedly spent so much time reading environmental works could not see how harmful this particular attitude is to hold, especially for marginalized groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "That glaring issue aside, I think her essays shined the most when they focused on her personal experiences. The epilogue was perhaps the most resonant part of this book for me, but I can't say I can recommend the rest of it very strongly. You need to spend a lot of time picking apart the arguments in this book, or else you run the risk of tacitly agreeing with some pretty uninformed/borderline dangerous viewpoints, which I fear many who read this book have done. Wilk is clearly a talented author in terms of her writing skills, so this makes it really easy to agree with a bad argument dressed up in lace.\n",
      "\n",
      "One book I will recommend in place of this one and touches upon similar ideas is Robin Wall Kimmerer's Braiding Sweetgrass. Kimmerer is able to provide the image of hope in the face of climate change that Wilk is unable to deliver, and also comes from both a personal and scientific background that better inform her views about the environment and how people form relationships with it.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This collection of essays takes its title from a short story by Margaret Atwood (which can be found in her 1991 collection Wilderness Tips) which is, on a very basic level, about humanity's relationship with the natural world (which is hardly an unusual theme for Atwood, of course), but also self-identity, the nature of perception, the nature of loss, environmentalism, feminism...all of which themes inform Wilk's interconnected essays as she discusses various books, films, and writers.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there's a single overlying concept to , it's a defence of genre writing—the importance of non-mainstream perspective and the utility of alternative or speculative story-telling—as Wilk discusses writers and books from the Old/New Weird (, ) to body-horror (, ) to sci-fi/cli-fi (, ) to cyberpunk/solarpunk (, ) to medieval mystics and 'alternative' philosophers (Hildegaard Von Bingen, r).\n",
      "\n",
      "I did find it interesting to read Wilk's take on these subjects...but I do wonder who exactly the readership for these essays might be...and whether I might be the best or the worst target audience (which is something I wondered about her Berlin-set, Creatives-charactered novel, ). I must say that I am already familiar with the majority of the books and authors Wilk writes about in this collection. Not that I didn't learn anything or wasn't inspired to seek out the writers I was unfamiliar with (, for example), but I wonder whether a reader who is less familiar with these books and genres (and/or vice versa) would appreciate ?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, what I found most engaging about the collection were the more personal elements—Wilk writing about her own methods and work habits, in particular the genesis of (which included a LARPing session of the book!)—even if, again, I found this relatable on a personal level, as it seemed reflective of some of my own work habits.\n",

These essays discuss women relating to nature, literary works, larping and her writing process. I found every essay extremely interesting! I’d tell you my fave essays but half of them were my faves. Sometimes I find it hard to articulate what I love about a book and that’s the case with this one. I just loved reading it! If you’re looking for you’re next non fiction read then pick this one up!

Ik kan het iedereen aanraden, de ervaring van het lezen alleen al was bijna meditatief. De rustige manier waarop Elvia Wilk filosofeert en referenties aan elkaar rijgt, openden ook iets bij mij. Het lezen van Death by landscape voelde op veel manieren als ademen, en ik had telkens het gevoel wat meer uitgerust te zijn nadat ik weer een paar pagina's had gelezen. Het boek ging een tijdje lang overal mee naartoe, in mijn jaszak. Dat gevoel ga ik nu missen, maar veel stukken zullen nog lang bij me blijven.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "This captivating page-turner is not a Detective Maigret novel but one Simenon termed , meaning uncomfortable or hard on the reader. With , each chapter begins with a brief epigraph, for example, the epigraph for Chapter 1 reads “In which Julius de Coster the Younger gets drunk at the Little-Saint George, and the impossible suddenly breaches the dykes of everyday life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's my choice of epigram for the book itself: \"The Case of Kees Popinga, or how upon hearing shocking revelations, a well-to-do bourgeois bean counter goes completely berserk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The first pages provide the setup: One icy December evening in the northern Dutch city of Groningen, forty-year-old family man Kees Popinga walks down to the dock to check on a cargo delivery he scheduled himself in his capacity as head clerk of an esteemed shipping firm. The enraged ship’s captain blasts him because the shipment did not arrived. Nonplussed, Kees strolls by a nearby pub only to see through the window, to his amazement, his boss, Julius de Coster, drinking at a table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Julius waves for him to come in, and, between swigs of brandy, breezily tells Kees in so many words that he, Mr. Pop-in-ga, is Popinga the Poopstick, prime stooge, a ninny so blind he couldn’t see how he, Julius de Coster, has been embezzling, stealing and cheating for years, not to mention having extramarital sex with former employee Pamela, an attractive young lady everyone in the company, including Kees Popinga, dreamed of going to bed with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Julius goes on, since he made a bad investment in sugar, the company is now bankrupt and not only will Popinga lose his job but also his life savings, thus his house and all other personal properties. Lowering his voice, Julius also informs Mr. Pop-in-ga that this is the very night he, the well-respected Julius de Coster, will be faking his own suicide and fleeing the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Mr. Popinga! Nothing like having your well-ordered, comfortable Dutch bourgeois world come crashing down in a heap of rubble. And how, we may ask, does our staid, conservative shipping clerk react to this disaster? The next morning, he makes his first radical decision: to stay under the covers in bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "What! Not go to the office, Kees? Mrs. Popinga is shocked, to say the least. Oh, yes, new world, new man. We read: “The important thing was that he felt completely at ease. This was the real him. Yes – this is how he should have acted all along.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for the first time in his adult life Kees Popinga has a taste of tranquility and joy, a state free from agitation and constant worrying, what he recognizes as “the real him” – and for good reason: many the spiritual and philosophical tradition maintaining such a combination of tranquility and joy is, in fact, our birthright, our true nature. As existential psychologist R.D. Laing observed: “Our 'normal' 'adjusted' state is too often the abdication of ecstasy, the betrayal of our true potentialities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And then we read: “Kees had always dreamed of being something other than Kees Popinga. That explained why he was so completely the way he was – so completely Kees Popinga – and why he even overdid it. Because he knew that if he gave even an inch, nothing would stop him again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, it’s all or nothing.- once the thin shell of rigid identity is even slightly cracked, the entire edifice breaks down. It’s as if, in his own clerkish way, Kees Popinga grasps R.D.

      "What follows when he travels to Amsterdam to have sex with Pamela (Julius de Coster bragged about how he set the luscious Pamela up in a particularly posh hotel) and then on to Paris is a truly odd series of events, a story Luc Sante in his to this edition calls both galling and comic.\n",

      "This Georges Simenon novel is a penetrating exploration into the psychology of personal identity. How far can Kees Popinga the bean counter free himself from his habit of counting beans (the former shipping clerk continually, almost obsessively, makes entries in a small red leather notebook he happens to find in his jacket pocket)? And how far will the consequences of his actions (for starters, he quite unintentionally kills Pamela) launch him into madness? If you are up for a quizzical existential tale by turns humorous and infuriating, this is your book.\n",

Routine sicura, consolidata, specchiata.\n",
      "Poi, però, a Simenon piace sconvolgere l’esistenza di questi uomini re del grigio, del torpore esistenziale. E nel caso di Kees, lo sconvolgimento è agitato più che miscelato: quando apprende dal suo datore di lavoro che la ditta sta per fallire, Kees decide di fare una gita a trovare l’amante del padrone. Cerca una forma di vendetta per il posto di lavoro perso? Perché il boss ha fatto bancarotta fraudolenta? In ogni caso, la donna non ci sta, e Kees finisce con l’ucciderla.\n",

Attinge alla sua passione e conoscenza del gioco degli scacchi per avviare una partita con la polizia francese e il commissario che guida le indagini. Si mette a correggere i giornali che fanno di lui un ritratto che reputa sbagliato: come se volesse finalmente costruirsi l’identità che ritiene più adatta a se stesso. Assapora una tardiva libertà sfrenata: che però subisce grossi limiti dal doversi nascondere e fuggire.\n",
      "A questo punto crede che l’unica soluzione e via di fuga sia eliminare il superfluo, spogliarsi di abitudini, luoghi sicuri e surplus. Solo che Kees si prende alla lettera, e conclude il suo percorso andandosene in giro per la campagna francese completamente nudo.\n",

      "Pubblicato nel 1938, Simenon aveva trentacinque anni e già una solida produzione alle spalle, sia di romanzi duri che racconti che avventure di Simenon. Eppure, a me, forse perché è stato il mio primo incontro con lo scrittore francese, è un romanzo con un sapore a parte, con una vena estrema che mi pare di non aver più ritrovato nelle pagine di Simenon.\n",
      "Quello che invece ho ritrovato in ogni altra lettura simenoniana è altrettanto scavo di personalità, altrettanta sottigliezza psicologica.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Cool as a cucumber, Dutchman Kees Popinga wonders around Paris with plenty of cash. Drinking, smoking, playing chess, entertaining women, seemingly without a care in the world, sounds great!. Oh, I forgot to mention the police are on his tail, as he is wanted for being the 'Amsterdam sex maniac', Kess himself sees this tag as a bit of an insult, that makes him mad (which he clearly is) believing he is nothing of the sort. Although he is a killer, you wouldn't think it.\n",
      "Leaving his family behind after the company he works for goes down the pan, he heads from the Netherlands to France completely at random and fueled by dark impulses, but always remaining calm and relaxed, unaware of being dragged ever lower due to his resilience and absolute confidence in his ability to outwit the French police, which he is good at for a time, however, when his downward spiral is set in motion from the moment he wakes up earlier in the story, there is no going back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The psychological portrait of a criminal on the run and his descent into insanity is the core of the novel. Next time an overconfident criminal starts sending letters to the press, I will be thinking of Popinga. It was Like being informed of the mind games behind the press releases and psychological profiling from today, Police methods haven’t really changed much since 1938 after this was was published. The character of Popinga is a bizarre spectacle and was riveting spending time in his company, chilling yes, but he never seemed threatening or reckless, and carried on with his new lease of life trying to be as normal as possible, while other people woven into the novel felt rather flat, and seemed to welcome unwanted trouble. Simenon generally devoted only about a week and a half to writing a novel (in-between getting his leg over with one of 10,000 girlfriends) a practice that, again, was good for his bank account and bad for his reputation. Will certainly read more of him.\n",

      "Too long caught up in the daily routine of his life as a Dutch petty-bourgeois, the good father of the family Popinga has just been fired free of the job, he intends to take example on his former boss, have a mistress like the beautiful Pamela. Still, he twists the blow like a duck.\n",
      "Became a fugitive, Popinga jumps on a train. An excellent thriller without his famous Simenon character Maigret. The point of the investigation is that it is enough to follow the character who changes identity and skin. Of cow! The man who loved watching the trains pass scrolls at full speed.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "It was time for another Simenon roman dur! I found this one once again quite different from the tales of the other romans durs. Cees Popinga, bookkeeper and living a stifling bourgeois life in Groningen in the north of Holland, quite accidently discovers one evening that he will loose his job the next day and, consequently, his comfortable income and possessions. At the spur of the moment he decides to radically break with his life and pursue a life he had no clear idea of that he had always wished to lead. He decided that from now on he would be a free man and do whatever would please him. He leaves Groningen the following day, not informing anyone of his departure, and pursues a path of ruthless self-interest by becoming an overconfident criminal in Paris. Interesting story as only Simenon can come up with in such a short tale. I must confess that I have liked a number of his other romans durs better, but this is certainly a strange tale which developed in an increasingly uncomfortable way. Perhaps I should not have read it in Dutch, even though the protagonist is a Dutchman, as the translation felt a bit awkward and outdated and that is not the Simenon we know!\n",

      "This is probably the most criminally underrated fantasy series out there (and I say that knowing that Phil Tucker's The Chronicles of the Black Gate exists.) It has excellent world-building that never overwhelms the twisty, complicated story that is given time to breathe but not dragged out, it has multiple interesting and complex characters that are allowed to have good and bad. The enmities/friendships/familial relationships/romance are so real I felt like an emotional vampire peeking in.\n",

      "This book gets a lot darker than the first one. Jon, the literal knight in shining armor of book 1 is forced to do things for the greater good that he finds abhorrent and that almost destroy who he is. Me being me, him becoming a destroyed mess for quite a large chunk of the book actually made me like him instead of the benign indifference I felt towards him in book 1. What can I say, I have a type? Rielle undergoes some truly horrific stuff that she does not fully recover from by the end of the book (and possibly never.) She was never sunshine and roses, but new and horrific trauma makes it all worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Brennan, ah...Brennan. It is no secret that Brennan is my favorite character times 10 and my love gets to new heights in this book. Ironically, while Rielle and Jon get massively darker, Brennan Karadis Marcel Redemption Tour 2017, tickets now at Ticketmaster, is in full swing. Brennan keeps (most of) his acquired maturity in this book and (in an ironic transformation of roles), it is his turn to be Rielle's shining knight to the rescue. He has plenty of flaws and always will (he will never leave his underhanded manipulative streak behind and his ease of killing is higher than Rielle or Jon's - unlike them he has little care for people in general, outside of those he loves.) But it is hard not to root for a man who will literally die to buy the woman he loves a few more minutes of life or who does his best to preserve as much of her dignity as he can in truly awful circumstances. I think the reason I love Brennan so much (in addition to the bond concept, or my love for screwed up guys who reform and repent) is that unlike Jon and Rielle, he's complicated even in love. His intensity and dedication are insane, but he took shelter in cruelty for earlier hurt in book 1 and even now, as he bares his heart and wills himself to step back, he still tries to meddle. In any reasonable estimation, Jon's love is \"better value\" - his is selfless - he is willing to have Rielle with Brennan if it makes her happy. Brennan's love is not selfless in the least. But he is also the one with shared history, who was there for Rielle when Jon was not, he is the one who didn't let greater good interfere with his hunt for Rielle.\n",

      "The book was good but to short. Serena and Roman have intense desire for each other but I missed where the love grew. I wanted a lot more after the office scene where it will they won't they over and over while they discover things they love about the other. Those were the parts that I missed in the book. The epilogue was good and probably got it its forth star. I will continue reading this series but I hope they link the series because I hate when authors write series and only link then by a common denominator rather than actually knowing one another.\n",

      "Not a novel, but as the title would suggest, a collection of passages or sketches by Charles Dickens (under the pseudonym of ‘Boz’) written between 1833-36 and originally published as individual pieces in newspapers/periodicals before being published collectively in one volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "This collection consists of 56 separate ‘sketches’ and is divided into four sections namely: ‘Our Parish, Scenes, Characters and Tales’. Each one of which providing a descriptive piece about that particular character or scene etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is important to note here is that this was written very early in the literary career of Charles Dickens, prior to the publication of his first novel ‘Pickwick Papers’. What Dickens gives us in these ‘sketches’ are vignettes from the past, from his world, from his London and provide us with a fascinating window on (mainly) London society of that time – as seen through the lens of Charles Dickens. What Dickens also gives us is a tantalising glimpse, a hint, a mere taste of his literary genius that was yet to come into fruition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst Dickens pieces in the first three sections of this book provide us with a fascinating insight into society of that time, it is the final section entitled ‘Tales’ that really gives us a feel for the literary delights that were to come ahead (particularly the most notable pieces such as ‘The Black Veil’ and ‘The Drunkards Death’). The pieces in that particular section constitute the most compelling part of the book and feel the closest to the novels that were to follow.\n",

      "‘Sketches by Boz’ does very much feel like a combination of two elements here, in that Dickens is:\n",

      "a. Practising, honing and fine-tuning his literary craft – doing the ground work and seeing how the pieces fit together, how things work, in preparation for the greater and infinitely more sophisticated things yet to come\n",

      "Split into four parts—Sketches, Scenes, Characters, and Tales—Sketches by Boz is Dickens’s apprenticeship to becoming a novelist of undeniable magnificence. The scenes here evoke pre-Victorian London with the forensic description, the restless persistence of detail, the compassionate eye, and the formidable wit familiar to those who have skimmed only a page of Chaz in school. Even in these earliest works, the only comparable depictions of London are to be found in everything Dickens wrote after. To say that Dickens’s genius sprung fully-formed from nowhere is correct, as these remarkably evocative pieces demonstrate with each irresistible scene, bursting with the splendid dialogue and unforgettable characters common to every Charlie production. It’s in the Tales, however, where Dickens brings the Dickens ruckus, exploring class tensions in ‘The Tuggs’s at Ramsgate’, absurd marriage rituals in ‘Horatio Sparkins’, a proto-Scrooge called Nicodemus Dumps in ‘The Bloomsbury Christening’, and exquisite comic farce in ‘The Boarding House’. The darker, compromising Dickens is also on form in his piece on Newgate Prison, and the melancholy closer ‘The Drunkard’s Death’. is not the beginning. This is where Dickens was born.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now my difficulty in writing this review is that I started Sketches by Boz about five years ago, but the reason it took me so long to finish this collection of vignettes and short stories is not that I found them plodding – some of them I did, though – but that we read them in a Dickens reading group here on Goodreads, and that we always read some of the Sketches in between major novels instead of dealing with the collection as a unit. This way, it took raaaaaaather long to get through the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "The collection consists of 56 individual pieces, which are divided into four groups. The reader starts with “Seven Sketches from Our Parish”, then there follow 25 “Scenes”, 12 pieces on “Characters”, before the collection is rounded off with another 12 “Tales”. The names of these groups are not strictly apt in that the “Scenes” tend to dwell on description of places in London – some of them particular, like Newgate, Doctor’s Commons, Vauxhall Gardens, some of them more generic, like London streets in the morning and at night, various shops or criminal courts – or that the “Characters” present us ingenious portrayals of people one would frequently meet in Victorian London, but still these sections also contain several narrative pieces. By the same token, the section entitled “Tales” is not exclusively made up of stories. , as we know it today, was published in a one-volume edition in 1839 – when Dickens’s fame had already been established with –, but there were two earlier collected editions of the sketches in 1836. The individual stories, as I will call them, appeared in various newspapers and periodicals between 1833 and 1836. Among them is the earliest story ever written by Dickens, namely “Mr. Minns and his cousin”, originally published in in December 1833, as “A Dinner at Poplar Walk”. does not present the stories in their original chronological order, and there is one story – “The Drunkard’s Death”, a very melodramatic piece with some quite impressive passages – that was written by Dickens expressly for the second 1836 edition, to “finish the volume with ”, as the Inimitable said. Whether “The Drunkard’s Death” is really the most memorable piece and the most suitable one to close this collection, is a question that will probably divide opinions: The early Dickens often got slightly heavy-handed when trying to give a description of domestic drama – nowhere more so than in –, but then “The Drunkard’s Death” is redeemed from stock drama through bewilderingly subjective passages like this one, when the drunkard drowns himself in a liquid he has hitherto rather neglected:\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, we can even steal some glimpse at the later Dickens and his ability to allow us readers to see into a haunted character’s mind and to share their agonies and fixations. All in all, this was, to me, the major attraction of this collection – to spot signs of Dickens as I have always known and loved him, in those earlier pieces. For example, when we take a look at most of the “Scenes”, we already find a lot of places described that will play their roles in later Dickens novels – and there is no question that Dickens’s ability to imbue places with a life of their own, sometimes driving on the characters in their pursuits, sometimes taking their characteristics from the very people living in them, was fully-fledged in some of these early pieces. There is such a thing as pathetic fallacy, when nature is vested with human emotions or characteristics, and Dickens – in these Sketches, but also later in his novels – proves himself a master of a particular kind of pathetic fallacy, an urban one, so-to-speak, namely when he draws the city itself, or parts of it, or people’s houses and rooms, as being imbued with a spirit of their own. Nobody who has read will ever forget the beginning of that haunting novel. This gift of Dickens’s, the ability to present a certain place as though it were pulsating with a life of its own, can be witnessed in many of these Sketches. And although lots of the situations presented in the Sketches could easily have found their way into the , e.g. in the form of interspersed tales, whereas other stories are rather lame in their lack of focus, there is already a lot in these tales that reminded me of Dickens in his maturity and at the height of his creativity. In a way, reading these Sketches is like doing an archaeologist’s work – only you are not digging downwards but into what was, at that time, still a future.\n",

      "There is nothing like reading a little Dickens for giving yourself a new perspective as a writer. When you find yourself on a bit of an ego trip, thinking how great and undervalued you are, Dickens makes you ashamed. He makes you feel like a pretender. And that's what you need. You need to strive to be better. Always. That's what Dickens did. A great example to us all. No matter what you're writing, you'll find you have something to learn from this man. His words are as relevant today as they always were.\n",

      "I rely on this book twice for both of my kids. It’s informative. I read it each week to be informed about my baby and being pregnant. This book was given to me by my OBGYN clinic from 8 years ago. I use it again for my second baby. I do recommend everyone to read this book. I don’t read many pregnancy books, just this one and what my doctor tells me. I occasionally google search any additional information I may need but majority I rely on this book for information about baby, what foods to eat, what to avoid, how to prepare my body so baby can be healthy and etc.\n",

      "This book was kinda fun at first because it shows you pictures of the baby's development every week. But the text made me sick to my stomach! As if I wasn't enough already... every week this doctor-author (a man, by the way) goes into everything that could possibly go wrong during a pregnancy - from the most rare complications on. It is ridiculous! It was scary and depressing at a time when you should be relishing in the amazing changes and visulizing nothing but the best outcomes. Pregnancy is full of aches and pains and strange feelings, and there's no reason to go and think that every pang is leading to something bad. This book is only good for the pictures - just don't read beyond that! Read Ina May Gaskin's or her other books instead- and relax!\n",

      "If you're looking for a week-by-week account of baby's growth and development, this book is not it, despite what you might think judging from the title. It gives roughly 2-5 sentences about your baby's approximate size and development per week, and then moves on to give you worst-case scenarios and things that can go wrong throughout your pregnancy. Sign up for an email newsletter that gives you weekly baby updates for free and spare yourself any needless worry or emotion this book could cause.\n",

      "If you read research and are aware that safe births can occur outside of hospital settings, prepare to be annoyed by the author's quick dismissal of midwife-attended homebirths, as well as her support of the antiquated notion that women should not eat or drink during labor. I sincerely hope that if women choose to read this book, they do not take it as the be-all end-all of pregnancy and birth.\n",

      "In the category of pregnancy reads, I would say this is one of my favorites and most useful books. In the category of weekly updates of what is most likely happening in your pregnancy, this is by far the best book of it's kind. I had so many recommendations to read a different book that has been around, but I am so glad that I found this one, in comparison the \"other\" book has nothing on this one. When curious about this book in it's republication, I found several negative reviews that talked about how it could cause a person to become neurotic knowing all the possible things that can go wrong. Really, what I can tell you from reading this cover to cover, is that it definitely has information on a bit of everything, most plausible diseases and complications. When I was reading this, if I came to a section on smoking mothers, it obviously did not apply to me, so I skipped over it. Same with other categories such as ethnic specific diseases and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "I find that this book is a wealth of information. Reading through can tell you plausible things to go wrong, but it also tells you all the miracles that are occurring step by step along the way. There are drawings that show about what the development looks like for your babies stage. There are fabulous exercise suggestions for each week and I would easily say that this is medically current and a comprehensive guide. With my background in nursing I would suggest this book highly.\n",

      "There's parts of this book that I think everyone should read, there's parts of this book that bored me to death, and there's parts of this book that I quite passionately disagreed with, but I always think with books like this that if someone can make you think of things in a different way, even if you end up not in agreement, it's still something which was worthwhile. So for me, the first half of the book was just fabulous, several concepts, which while not necessarily new, were written in such a way that they changed my perspective on what the concepts actually meant. And even better, it was really easy reading. I did feel that the book lost its way a bit when the author strayed from concentrating on the 5 things, and I started to find the book somewhat frustrating and just lacking in focus... but by the end it picked up beautifully to make it pretty close to a 4 star rating from me. I dare say it's a book that I will reread, and it's certainly inspired me enough to read some other books by the same author.\n",

      "This book is seriously one of, if not, the best self-help book i've ever read. Not that i've read much, but after reading this, I feel no need to read any more. It's basically a trip to the psychologist in a book. David Richo explains the five things we cannot change in life, or \"givens\", and the things we gain by embracing them. Ultimately wisdom, understanding, loving-kindness and happiness. All throughout reading this book, I realized that most of what we read in self-help books, are the very things which we already know deep down inside of us, but just need that reassurance, some form of understanding by another human being, to help us understand it ourselves. This book is no Holy Bible or The Secret, but is just a regular book, written by a normal guy, who seeks only to understand himself and the world around him a little better, all the while sharing his knowledge and wisdom to those who are willing to believe in it.\n",

His description of how to be with, and stay with, your own emotions/thoughts/experiences, as a way to heal and grow, is fascinating and right on. I cannot wait to read more from him!\n",

      "\n",
      "I am always on the lookout for a writer who is a little bit different, a little bit quirky, fresh, original, etc. That's why I was so excited to discover Carolyn Crane and Gail Carriger this year. A favorite \"quirky\" author of mine, who has branched out from romance to mysteries, and whose writing keeps getting better and better (what a breath of fresh air that is!) is Annette Blair. I do believe her new mystery series showcases the very best of her writing ability. She has such a lovely, snappy cadence to her prose, it's a delight to read. Her \"voice\" is fresh, modern, peppy. Her heroine is adorable....obsessed with vintage clothing and hiding a paranormal secret. She can \"read\" old clothes when the time is right. This series is told from first person POV, but instead of the heroine being a snarky, irritating bitch, she is actually a smart, caring, creative and fashionable sleuth/shop-owner/vintage clothing aficionado.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a delicious love triangle going on in this series. The sexual tension is fabulous...Madeira has not one, but two hunky law enforcement officers lusting for her, and I can't decide who to root for! Werner is the straight laced cop, and Nick is the sexy, alpha FBI agent. Decisions, decisions! (Although I guess I am leaning somewhat towards Werner...I'm thinking of making a T-shirt that says \"Team Wiener\"--and no, I'm not talking about dachshunds. Get your mind out of the gutter! I'm not talking about that either!).\n",
      "\n",
      "Throw in a bunch of wonderful settings (mansions, the theatre, a charming small town, etc), gorgeous descriptions of vintage clothes, quirky family members, really cool paranormal stuff, and a snappy mystery. And you've got Death By Diamonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some bizarre reason, I find myself crying a lot when I read Annette's books. First, I cried while reading her dedication page, which is written for her husband. Oh, Jiminy!--\"my heart's haven\"!!!!!! I love that! Then, I found myself crying at the end of the book. Beneath the vintage clothes and curious mystery, this story is ultimately a love story, which is illuminated in the final pages of the book. It is very sweet and very touching. Blair's writing is an awesome juxtaposition of modern, snappy prose with a very sentimental, old-fashioned heart underneath. I love it!\n",

A local homicide detective is a close friend.\n",

Wearing her Dominique 's clothing, Maddie has several versions of her friend's recent life. She needs to finds answers to many questions. Among them are what kill her friend, where are the diamonds, did her friend have a lover, and how did the play her friend was in effect her death?

      "This book should be required reading for educators at all levels. Like all great ideas, Understanding by Design presents a process that seems like common sense, is surprisingly difficult to implement properly, but could have astounding results. The premise behind Understanding by Design is that learning doesn't happen by accident, or merely by hard work on the part of students and teachers, but from the deliberate mastery of skills in pursuit of hard questions. Understanding by Design doesn't require much more work on the part of teachers than other approaches, but requires great courage and clarity in describing what is being learned, and why.\n",
      "\n",
      "UbD centers around understanding, and the idea that when students really get something, they're able to perform effectively with knowledge and wisely transfer what they've learned across domains, rather than simply reciting facts or plugging through the steps of an algorithm. \"Understanding\" is a slippery phrase that is somewhat unfashionable. For example it's not in the original 1956 Bloom's and is relegated to a basic level in subsequent revisions, but the word serves better than any other to mark the difference between someone who gets it, and someone who has not yet. The common enemies of understanding are 'coverage without context', textbook driven learning akin to reading the encyclopedia A-Z, and 'activities without purpose', hands-on activities that do not connect back to a larger point. Rather, the goal is to help students Big Questions for themselves; the eternal scholarly and humanistic debates that link back to individual life experience and mastery over specialized skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Desired understanding must be linked to a proper assessment of that understanding. Here, Wiggins and McTighe make their single strongest pedagogic claim, that understanding can only truly be measured by authentic performance-based tasks, typically complex and realistic and built around creating reasoned and supported answers, so that a student may be successfully proven to have learned something. Assessment is a also a continuous process, and UbD recommends a continuous feedback loop of practice and evaluation, as well as 'one-minute essays' at the close of class about what students have learned and what they are confused about. The book supports realistic assessment over teaching to the test with a survey of major research that shows that better performing countries have realistic problem-based assessment, and that this method when used in America, leads to improvements in all schools, with the greatest improvements in deprived under-performing schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final step, planning for learning, connects understandings and assessments to the daily practice of what is done in the classroom. This section is the least developed, introducing the WHERETO heuristic, but mostly leaving it up to educators to decided what in their box of tools is appropriate for the situation. It's a fair trade-off, given that they need to supply advice for teachers in every topic from K-16, but it annoyed me that just when we're about to get our hands dirty, the book backs off to a level of abstraction.\n",

      "Good teachers will know everything in this book intuitively. Hesitant, or less well-prepared teachers (ahem, junior faculty) will benefit from having some wise words to justify what they know is right. Organizations will benefit from a common plan and language for building up binders full of good classes. This is a wonderfully crafted, action-oriented, theoretically grounded, guide for creating classes that matter, rather than classes that merely have to be completed.

      "Understanding by Design is a technical publication for building curriculum using the backward design process. This book helps instructors support their work by implementing Essential Questions so that a course can be built around the end result and focused on understanding rather than milestones and tasks. It is a pretty basic lesson planning guide – almost a 101 for teachers of anything. It lacks a few fundamental ideas, such as using taxonomy as a basis for questioning, but I think that the book's primary focus is on building of courses, lessons, and units rather than pedagogical technique.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few things I like about it – it teaches the concepts and also manages to include applicable strategies and forms that will help the instructor build their unit. It is also well written. Some things I don't like is that it is unnecessarily wordy in many places, and it contains many useless graphics that illustrate ideas that are not really difficult for anyone to grasp. One final note is that the author uses unnecessary humor at times that I think really just adds to the wordiness of some topics that are relatively simple to grasp.\n",

UbD describes a set of strategies useful for university students and first graders, science classes and physical education.

Obviously, impossible.\n",

      "The premise and main message of the book is good. Basically it's advocating that all teachers purposefully design their units and curriculum around the premise that students should understand the big ideas undergirding the content of the course, rather than covering a certain amount of information. Frankly, I'm not entirely sure why this even needed to be written, isn't that common sense? Alas, I think that this book was written as a response to American public school education, and I, having never attended an American public school, or indeed any public school, have never experienced the kind of teaching the book excoriates, 'coverage', where you march through a textbook and memorize facts and never engage with the wheretoes and the whyfores of those facts. I'm thinking back to both my homeschool classes and my boarding school classes...yes, I attended a boarding school, it makes me sound so snobby or 19th century...but one, I lived close enough to not have to board, as did most of the students, and two, there's not many other options in Ecuador, if you want to get a decent education...Anyway. I can't remember a class where we didn't engage with underlying ideas. Maybe not all of the underlying ideas that the book talks about, in all subject areas, but what educational system could? At the very least home-schooling successfully instilled in me the ability of autonomous learning, being self-motivated, and seeking after learning for the pleasure of it. Apparently that's the holy grail of this book, and one of the goals of this curriculum design framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other main idea of the book is that a curriculum should be designed backwards. That you should clearly delineate the goal of what you want the students to learn, apply or perform, then build the curriculum towards that goal: designing scaffolding, activities, assignments and rubrics that all build to that goal, rather than doing activities for the sake of activities that don't really have any bearing on your stated goal. Again...I'm not entirely certain why that needed to be written. Isn't that common sense? Apparently not. Seriously, what is taught in education classes at the college level? Is the reason that I find this ludicrous because I skipped the undergrad education courses and went straight to the graduate level? Or is it because I went for a TESOL degree and you kind of have to teach with specific language goals in mind if you want to have any success? Or is it because I was forced to teach in a coverage aspect at my first job and was excessively frustrated by it because it obviously didn't work, therefore there must be a better way? Or is it that I just gained this knowledge implicitly because of being homeschooled? I don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come to think of it though, the statistic classes that I have taken have all followed the cardinal sins of this book. They march through a bunch of discrete skills and you never learn how to apply it to messy real life data, you just have to sort of infer it. This works for things like means, and medians, and even standard deviations, but once you get into inferential statistics...how are you supposed to know which test you are supposed to use, on which data set, to get which prediction? I haven't the foggiest most of the time. Can I even use these tests with my data as it is not normally distributed?\n",
      "\n",
      "The other cardinal sin this book mentions is that students walk away being able to quote facts but not being able to articulate the underlying ideas behind those facts. That is true, and I think exacerbated by internet culture. When people are arguing on the internet, they post a paper, or an article backing up their point...but they never make a point. They're like 'you're wrong' paper linked. That doesn't actually demonstrate that I am wrong, and even less does it demonstrate that you are right. It demonstrates that you lack the ability to make your own argument. It's particularly frustrating because so often they depend on the headline or the abstract and assume that it says what they want it to say, but when you read the actual article it disproves their point. This has happened to me, multiple times. It makes me bemoan the problems with literacy in the western world. Something is obviously not working in how we teach argumentation skills and reading skills. That or humans are just inherently lazy and can't be bothered to actually pursue knowledge and take the easiest route.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book did have really good pointers and a couple of good personal/professional development tools. Self-assessment of lessons and units is critical, and is often not done. Repetition of lessons and units across years is critical, and is often not done. It took me about five years to get my Freshman English curriculum really refined and useful at my last university. The first time you teach a class: it's crap. Sorry. Just facts. You don't really have a lot of time to plan, you are inundated with meetings, classes, grading, and you are struggling to keep your head above the water. You do your best to design a class that meets the needs of your students, but you don't really have enough experience to even know what the needs of your particular demographic of students are. The first year is all experimentation, you try things, they don't work, you try other things that do, and you save those things and then reincorporate them into next year. Slowly, each year, things get better and more streamlined, until finally you have a product that is actually useful. Teaching, lesson planning and curriculum design is a process and inherently takes time and that is a point that this book was careful to make and that needs to be made. I have seen teachers avoid this process. They teach each unit once, even though they have the same class, they get bored so they never review or edit what they teach and instead go on to something different each year. One, that's a ton of extra work, two, that treats every year like the first year, and three, their curriculum design never really improves. I've seen the other extreme, where a teacher does use the same unit every year, and never changes it...that blows my mind. So I can see why this book felt the need to address that topic, that's obviously a problem and needs to be corrected.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand. I didn't like the book! I didn't like the writers! I felt that there was way too much unnecessary jargon. I felt that they are too insistent on following their \"WHERETO\" acronym...which I found obtuse and impossible to remember, let alone implement. I got very sick of their assumptions of things as facts...even as they advocated questioning everything! Gah! It's the postmodern Achilles heel: \"Question everything: except postmodernism.\" \"The meaning of a text is what you make of it, not necessarily what the author meant to convey.\" That's stupid. Yes, each person walks away with a subtly different take on the book that they read. My feeling that the authors of this book are sometimes pompous may not be what they intended to pass on. But that really only applies to secondary aspects of the text. If I walk away from this book with the received meaning: I should teach by covering a ton of information, I have completely missed the point of the book! They specifically acknowledge that a text's purpose is to communicate specific information in how they are constantly having 'misapprehension alerts'. Don't misunderstand what we are writing. I always wonder if they apply this to the spoken word too. It seems to me that when you take this philosophy to it's logical extreme then you are denying the ability to communicate ideas at all. Yes, in our inner mind when someone says 'cup' we all represent that word differently. Some have a mental representation of a black mug, some have a glass, some have a tea cup, some have pictures in their head, some have words, but we all agree on certain aspects, it's a container to hold liquid, that all follow the same basic shape of having sides taller than the width of the base. If we didn't all agree on this same basic meaning, communication would be impossible. If I decided to associate 'cup' with a flat piece of paper used to mark my place in a book, I would be wrong. The same is true when you string words into phrases, sentences, and texts. There is a distinct meaning you wish to convey. Some of the trimmings don't necessarily matter, or you leave up to the imagination of the reader to fill in the gaps, but the core meaning doesn't change and isn't open to interpretation, if it was language would not communicate.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that part bothered me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other part that bothered me was the facets of understanding: application, empathy, explanation, interpretation, perspective and self-knowledge. I'm sorry. I don't think these are all equally important. I don't. I don't think empathy should be on the same par as application, explanation and interpretation. To be brutally honest, I don't think perspective and self-knowledge are on the same level either. Self-assessment is important, you need to be able to look and see when something isn't working and correct. I don't think seeing things from other perspectives or having empathy with those other perspectives is important in all subject areas. What is the use of looking at mathematics empathically? What is the use of looking at other perspectives in mathematics at a basic level, or even an algebraic level? What is there to be empathic about in science? In history or literature, cultural studies or linguistic studies, I get it, it's important. But what is practical about teaching different perspectives on numbers in K-12 education? Our goal should be to prepare students for living in the real world, where numbers have concrete meanings and equations have practical uses. Sure, teach them that this works because we accept a priori certain numerical relationships, but also teach them that we accept these a priori beliefs because it works in the world we live in. If in higher education they want to go on to explore other mathematical systems, go for it, but I don't think that belongs in elementary education. There's a reason it's called elementary. It's supposed to be about the basics.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also see a problem with the over emphasis of empathy in our culture at large. We so often empathize with one person to the exclusion of the other person or people involved. In our rush to empathize with the victim of society, we forget to empathize with the needs of the other people in society. You can see this in the homeless problem we have now. We empathize with people who have mental illness and don't want to put them in homes, because we value self-determination and think that everyone should have it. But, when the mentally ill take over public parks and sidewalks because of this value, now those who have the right to use those parks and sidewalks in safety cannot because they are occupied by those who have a tenuous grasp on reality and behave in unpredictable and often dangerous ways. Our empathy with one group has overridden our empathy for another. This is a constant problem in our society today, because we prioritize certain groups over others, because of a perceived lack of power, or of historical wrongs done against that group. If empathy were applied to every group equally it would be fine, but we are hierarchical creatures, even when we claim not to be, we empathize with certain groups and exclude others. We need to empathize with the feelings of the native Americans as their land was taken from them. Yes, we do. But we also need to empathize with the feelings of the settlers. They were not inhuman, they had motivations, understandable ones, for what they did. It's not this group is wholly good and put upon, and this group is wholly evil and predatory, but so often in the name of empathy this is what ends up being taught. We are reactionary, we go from one extreme to the other. From manifest destiny to colonization is inherently evil. All we are doing is reacting and swinging to the opposite extreme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway. There were good aspects in the book. There were aspects I didn't like. One thing that I shall COMPLETELY take to heart is that it says that textbooks are not a syllabus, they are a resource, and sections should be pulled out because they meet your goals, not because you feel it necessary to cover all the information in them. I shall take this to heart by not teaching everything in this book, and choosing the chapters that I think are most relevant to the goal of helping students learn to create a curriculum that is well-designed. I'm not sure they meant it to be applied to their book, but it shall be.\n",

      "Once again, Donna Gephart delivers a funny, heartwarming and wholly original tale of a boy who faces some real challenges: the death of a parent, the threat of eviction, the cruelty of a bully, and his grandfather's Alzheimer's disease. In trademark Gephart style, the seriousness of these issues is balanced with humor and optimism. Ben, the likable main character, pins his hopes on winning a contest with his witty slogans for toilet paper to avoid eviction from the apartment he shares with his mom and his grandfather. A quirky best friend named Toothpick and a spunky senior neighbor show Ben true friendship when the tough going gets even tougher. This book will make you laugh out loud; the scene with the dentures is HYSTERICAL! Be prepared to get a little verklempt, too, especially if you have recently experienced the loss of a loved one. Gephart should also be commended for her deft depiction of Jewish characters, something which is hard to find in books for middle grade readers. I will recommend this one to fans of Wendy Mass.\n",

      "The Dumbest Spy in the World\n",
      "\n",
      "Cummings, C. (2001). A Spy By Nature. New York: St. Martins\n",
      "\n",
      "The protagonist is a recent college graduate in London who works in a dead end telemarketing job and feels his life drifting. He applies for a job as a spy and apparently does well in the application, but is ultimately rejected without explanation. Or is he really? A retired MI5 acquaintance mysteriously invites him to join his international oil firm as a clerk, with a covert mission to spy on a competing American oil company. Young Alec accepts the job despite the lousy pay, long hours and probationary status, and sets about charming the socks off a couple of Americans in London who represent the American oil firm. He manages to establish a solid friendship, skillfully presenting himself as disgruntled, so that, predictably, the Americans turn him and soon he is passing information about the London oil company to them. All this takes at least 200 pages and is skillfully written. Then Alec acts stupidly, completely and unbelievably out of character, the dumbest spy in the world, and his cover is blown, his career ended. The end.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story is very plodding and predictable, with essentially no dramatic tension, because there is nothing significant at stake, and because there is no situational drama baked into the cake. What keeps the book from screaming boredom is good writing in thoughtful and keenly observed, if mundane, scenes.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I read this book after two of the author's other books. Had I read this one first, I wouldn't have read another. It's not often I get to the end of a book and want to scream, but this book has an ending that makes no sense to me. In addition, the main character is completely unlikeable.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "One of the worst endings since Russo's 'Empire Falls'. The protagonist is unlikable, inconsistent and quite frankly an egotistical pansy, if that combo can exist. There are a few moments of articulate insight into young career angst, but not enough to save this or sell it.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A Spy by Nature, Charles Cumming’s first novel, is the semi-autobiographical precursor several subsequent espionage stories that have caught the attention of reviewers and the reading public alike. The Trinity Six, the most recent, was a deft and ingenious reimagining of the familiar story of the five aristocratic Cambridge graduates whose greatest fame came when they defected to the Soviet Union after many years of undercover work in Britain.\n",
      "\n",
      "In A Spy by Nature, Cumming tells a version of his own story as a recruit to the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). His protagonist, Alec Milius, is a 24-year-old underperformer in London who devotes three months to testing and interviews preparatory to joining MI6, only to be rejected. The consolation prize is a job as a “support agent,” a species of contractor, who is placed in a British oil company with the assignment to infiltrate its American competitor and feed it disinformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Alec’s story unfolds, he finds himself more and more deeply enmeshed in a web of distrust and betrayal that brings out the worst in him — and generates tragic consequences. Cumming’s portrayal of his alter ego is utterly convincing, and the story brings to light an increasingly important aspect of latter-day espionage in the post-Cold War Era: industrial espionage.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Spy by Nature is an entirely worthy antecedent of Cumming’s later, more fully realized spy stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "(From )\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I worry that sometimes I'm reading a completely different book to the one that a lot of other people have reviewed...\n",
      "\n",
      "If this book is, as the cover promises, \"taughtly written, cleverly plotted\" then either the contents of my copy had been cunningly replaced by a windy, over-long and largely drama-free doppelganger or my understanding of \"taught\" and \"clever\" needs some serious work! Aside from the fact that the leading character is so unremittingly unlikeable that I ended up sincerely hoping the CIA would put him and his readers out of their misery (sadly the open ending denies us this wonderful reward), the basic premise of a spy story is that it will reward us with action, tension, or ideally both - A Spy by Nature signally fails on both counts..!\n",
      "\n",
      "Other reviewers have suggested that this is something of a \"poor relation\" to Mr Cumming's later books. This may indeed be so, but I for one won't be troubling to find out since something twice as good would still rate somewhere in the region of mildly disappointing.\n",

      "I've waited eagerly for Vail's The Mad Elf Prince book, since I saw him in book 1. Oh man, I was not dissapointed !\n",
      "Perfect couple and so different from the pattern.\n",
      "Both MCs suffer of PTSD , Vail more so then Rosalind, because he was enslaved, controlled ,violated and subjected to torture 4000 years by the dark witch Loren killed in the first book.\n",
      "Rosalind is trying to cope with the fact that she has taken lives in the war between the 3rd and 5th Realm ( you can see her in action at the end of book 2).She is kidnapped and taken as slave by the new demon king of the 5 th Realm and forced to heal his injured warriors. Her powers are bound by dark magic so she is pretty much defenseless.When a new man is brought for her to heal, she feels a deep connection to him, and soon learns that he might be exactly what her grandmother predicted for her.\n",
      "Rosalind is the perfect mate for Vail, for he is not a man that is easy to be around. His schizo episodes, anger outbursts, blackouts and nightmares made him unpredictable and a real threat for her, but she handled him like a pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved that this was a slow burn, it took lots of work on Vail for him to open up and slowly learn to overcome his hatred and darkness. I also liked that this book centered on them as a growing pair, and had less secondary characters income. We still get plenty of action and steam and swoon moments, but mostly heartbreaking ones when in Vail's mind.\n",

      "Wow! Just, wow! The Eternal Mates series is one of my favorites and each book just makes me love it more. I was hooked by Kissed by a Dark Prince then after reading Claimed by a Demon King I thought that Heaton couldn't possibly create a better story, but I was wrong folks! Tempted by a Rogue Prince is now at the top of my favorite paranormal/fantasy book list. Vail, aptly known as the \"Mad Elf Prince\", tore my heart to shreds. I had to consistently tell myself to suck those tears back in. Be strong. It's a story. It's not really happening. Let me tell you, none of that helped. If you are sensitive to the suffering, torture, and self loathing of a strong male character, Vail just may leave you a quivering and blubbering mess. Oh my heavens, Heaton got me good with this one. I loved every one of the tear dabbing, snot sniffing scenes with Vail. I loved this book so much that I don't even know where to begin or how to properly convey just how much I appreciated the journey Heaton took me on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Vail and Rosalind are confused by and fighting against prophecies dictated to them regarding their mates. Vail knows that his mate was to be a witch and after what he suffered at the hands of Kordula he wants nothing more than to destroy anyone who embodies the same magic that was used against him. Rosalind on the other hand is living with the knowledge that when she finds her mate it will lead to her death. Neither is looking for or wanting a mate and under the circumstances that they find themselves love is the last thing on their minds.\n",
      "\n",
      "You get a strong engrossing story way before you get the sexiness with this one. There isn't a real sex scene until after the 60% mark and I assure you that you won't miss it. Keeping Vail and Rosalind from coming together physically until later is especially important to the realism of their story. There simply is no way that Vail could have been open to a real relationship with Rosalind after suffering through over 4,000 years of being controlled and tortured by a dark witch. Rosalind was a perfect blend of compassion with a strong sense of morality and strength, intelligence, and perseverance.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are also introduced to an incubus by the name of Fenix, a new secondary character that I now need to read more about because his story will revolve around a horrible curse that could also be another awesome ride. Heaton is good at throwing these little firecrackers into her story that peaks your interest, leaves you wanting to know more, but somehow still doesn't take away from the main story at hand. Yes, Felicity Heaton is a tease of a writer, but I love her for it. If you are a paranormal romance fan do yourself a favor and start this series now. The stories are engaging, both the male and female characters are dynamic, interesting, and multi-layered, and best of all the series is still at the beginning and there are set ups for many more stories to come. I'm am now anxiously awaiting stories for Bleu, Grave, and now Fenix. Oh, the sweet, sweet, pain of waiting for a favorite character's featured story. The next book in the Eternal Mates series is Hunted by a Jaguar it will be Kyter/Iolanthe's story and is due January 2015 so you have plenty of time to read the first three books and be all caught up for it's release.\n",

      "Vail is the \"mad elf prince\" striking fear in all the paranormal world. But Vail is not \"mad\" by choice. He was driven to it over centuries of being under the spell of a dark witch. He was forced to kill people.  Much like Zsadist in the BDB series by J.R. Ward, Vail was sexually abused, well really he was repeatedly raped by the dark witch. It's no wonder why Vail would hate all witches much like Uilleam MacRieve. They both hate witches because of how they were abused by one and both of their fated mates are witches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vail has a severe case of PTSD. Any time he feels magic, sees a witch, or touched by someone he blackouts and returns to the hell he lived through. Slowly Rosalind learns what triggers Vail's madness and tries to bring him out of it.\n",

      "Rosalind has a few issues of her own. She is trying to live with the guilt over killing people. True she did it for a good reason to protect herself and her friends. But Rosalind is a light witch and does her best not to hurt people and has a strong connection to nature. Much like Vail, Rosalind is dealing with PTSD, seeing blood brings her back to the battlefield where she had to kill to say alive.\n",

      "TEMPTED BY A ROUGE is a step away from Felicity Heaton's usually sexy novels and takes us to a dark place with Vail. It was a little slow in parts for me but over all I enjoyed getting to know about Vail and Rosalind and was glad to see they got their HEA.\n",

      "\n",
      "Tempted by a Rouge Prince is book three in the Eternal Mates series by Felicity Heaton. Another Amazing Spectacular read by Ms. Heaton! I have been waiting on the edge of my seat for Vail’s tail ever since he was introduced in Kissed by a Dark Prince. I was blown away by the emotional, heart-wrenching, action packed adventure. We start off just after the second book and the battle that took place in Hell. \n",
      "\n",
      ", our Mad Elf Prince, brother to Loren. He was tricked and used by a dark witch several millennia ago. Now he suffers emotional and mental issues. You see throughout the series that he is trying so hard to fight the witch who has him under her control. His battle to find some peace for himself is just starting. Ms. Heaton did an amazing job showing us the battle inside. The conflicting emotions and desires that go through Vail were well done and I was crying at times just from how much I felt for him.\n",
      "\n",
      ", a witch, Vail’s mate his Little Wild Rose as he calls her. She has been avoiding any contact with the elves; because of a prediction her grandmother gave her. This has made her a hermit (sorta) unable to live her life; because of the fear of the prediction. In Claimed by a Demon King she ends up helping in the battle, but in doing so ends up a prisoner to those she fought and now battles nightmares of what she did in the war. Ms. Heaton did a fabulous job with Rosalind. I was not sure if she would be strong enough to help Vail, but she finally faces her fear to embrace life and love. I enjoyed the struggles she went through both physical and emotional. \n",
      "\n",
      "I just love the series. Ms. Heaton does an amazing job of bring together everything a PNR needs. The writing style flows easily and the story pulls you in making it so hard to put the book down. Remarkable plot and character development. The action battle scenes where so real and detailed. The sex was fantastic and the connection the character’s make are well matched. \n",

      "Once again, Donna Gephart delivers a funny, heartwarming and wholly original tale of a boy who faces some real challenges: the death of a parent, the threat of eviction, the cruelty of a bully, and his grandfather's Alzheimer's disease. In trademark Gephart style, the seriousness of these issues is balanced with humor and optimism. Ben, the likable main character, pins his hopes on winning a contest with his witty slogans for toilet paper to avoid eviction from the apartment he shares with his mom and his grandfather. A quirky best friend named Toothpick and a spunky senior neighbor show Ben true friendship when the tough going gets even tougher. This book will make you laugh out loud; the scene with the dentures is HYSTERICAL! Be prepared to get a little verklempt, too, especially if you have recently experienced the loss of a loved one. Gephart should also be commended for her deft depiction of Jewish characters, something which is hard to find in books for middle grade readers. I will recommend this one to fans of Wendy Mass.\n",

      "Have you ever read a book where the plot ideas were mostly interesting but you keep checking the page count to see how many pages you have left because everything is taking forever to actually get somewhere? That was me reading this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book FELT like the long 700+ page novel that it was and really could have used an editor to skim it down some (basically the entire Liam/elves storyline and all the sections from the point of view of Shadow). Yet with all theses pages and pages of things that could have been reduced or removed entirely without impacting the plot, the author managed to almost completely omit one important scene (spoiler:\n",
      ").\n",
      "\n",
      "I mentioned in the last book that I hoped that the romance triangle would shake up in this book, and it did, but not entirely in a way I enjoyed, this definitely feels like just a speed bump for the 'real' relationship which is just irritating. I think I will just stop at this book, these things are too long to not be loving them sadly.\n",

      "Miranda did not pull any punches with this book. I have not been so enraptured and edgy in a long time with a new fantasy series (especially with this only being the second book). If I was a nail biter, I surely wouldn’t have any nails left. The plot still continues to be enticing and the characters complex (even though I wanted to punch he who shall not be named a few times...ok more than a few). Miranda will forever be an auto buy author for me.\n",

      "I really truly liked the first book in the series but I love this one! I want to have angsty gorgeous magic babies with it! Or maybe just scorching hot quasi-sex to fool my captors and keep my cover? (YES, this is a thing that happens in the book. YES, the thought of it will keep me happy for days.)\n",
      "\n",
      "But fine - to be serious for a minute or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is probably the most criminally underrated fantasy series out there (and I say that knowing that Phil Tucker's The Chronicles of the Black Gate exists.) It has excellent world-building that never overwhelms the twisty, complicated story that is given time to breathe but not dragged out, it has multiple interesting and complex characters that are allowed to have good and bad. The enmities/friendships/familial relationships/romance are so real I felt like an emotional vampire peeking in.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book gets a lot darker than the first one. Jon, the literal knight in shining armor of book 1 is forced to do things for the greater good that he finds abhorrent and that almost destroy who he is. Me being me, him becoming a destroyed mess for quite a large chunk of the book actually made me like him instead of the benign indifference I felt towards him in book 1. What can I say, I have a type? Rielle undergoes some truly horrific stuff that she does not fully recover from by the end of the book (and possibly never.) She was never sunshine and roses, but new and horrific trauma makes it all worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Brennan, ah...Brennan. It is no secret that Brennan is my favorite character times 10 and my love gets to new heights in this book. Ironically, while Rielle and Jon get massively darker, Brennan Karadis Marcel Redemption Tour 2017, tickets now at Ticketmaster, is in full swing. Brennan keeps (most of) his acquired maturity in this book and (in an ironic transformation of roles), it is his turn to be Rielle's shining knight to the rescue. He has plenty of flaws and always will (he will never leave his underhanded manipulative streak behind and his ease of killing is higher than Rielle or Jon's - unlike them he has little care for people in general, outside of those he loves.) But it is hard not to root for a man who will literally die to buy the woman he loves a few more minutes of life or who does his best to preserve as much of her dignity as he can in truly awful circumstances. I think the reason I love Brennan so much (in addition to the bond concept, or my love for screwed up guys who reform and repent) is that unlike Jon and Rielle, he's complicated even in love. His intensity and dedication are insane, but he took shelter in cruelty for earlier hurt in book 1 and even now, as he bares his heart and wills himself to step back, he still tries to meddle. In any reasonable estimation, Jon's love is \"better value\" - his is selfless - he is willing to have Rielle with Brennan if it makes her happy. Brennan's love is not selfless in the least. But he is also the one with shared history, who was there for Rielle when Jon was not, he is the one who didn't let greater good interfere with his hunt for Rielle.\n",
      "\n",
      "It kills me to ship Rielle x Brennan so hard because I am 95% sure he is not the endgame - Miranda Honfleur clearly wants us to see Jon x Rielle as star-crossed\n",
      "But even though I like Jon in this book, like him a lot, he is just not as interesting to me, sorry. I've seen the Sarah J Maas comparisons for MH and they are pretty warranted so maybe I will get lucky and the bad boy/angstbucket will get the girl, but I am not holding out hope.\n",

I spent most of his chapters hate reading and hoping he'd fall off a cliff.\n",

      "I think the only thing that could be off-putting about this series is the length. The name of the game these days is instant gratification in books, it seems. I'm not a huge fan of that. I like series that take their time because often the more you rush a story, the more gaping plot holes you'll leave. When I downloaded this on kindle, the time to read made me do a double take, especially since I'm a fast reader. But folks, the investment is worth it.\n",

      "I enjoyed this series, but the author has flat out said, \"Dear Readers, this is a public service announcement. Do not read Killer Characters if you can't handle a non Disney ending. It doesn't have one. It's not a fairy tale.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't need a Disney ending, but I don't need an ending that destroys everything I enjoyed about the series. So I shall take the author's advice, and not finish the book. I'd rather remember Olivia and Rawlings and the rest of the gang the way they were in previous books. I already knew Laurel was an idiot and her husband a major jerk, I don't need to read this book to confirm that.\n",
      "\n",
      "*ETA: After thinking about it for a while, I think the biggest thing that has fans upset is that this was a COZY mystery series. It's supposed to be a fun read, not a heart-breaker. The mystery gets solved in the end and no matter how much danger the idiot MC puts themselves and their friends in, they all get out ALIVE. Because it's a @#!%ing COZY!\n",

      "This series has been my favorite cozy mystery series and I am sad to read that the series is ending with this book. I am not going to write a synopsis of the plot as others have done so. I want to relate why this book and this series was my favorite. It is mainly due to Ellery Adams creative and original writing. She does not do cookie cutter plots and each book is different from other cozy mystery series. My favorite was Written in Stone. I felt it should have been up for an award the year it was written.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I like about the series too is the characters. As readers we have watched Olivia evolve into a warmer and more giving person. I often wondered when the author started the series, if she knew where she wanted to go with Olivia or if Olivia just evolved more from book to book. I will miss the Bayside Writers. They are interesting people who I was always interested in keeping up with.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ending of the book at this point has polarized readers. When I thought about the ending, I thought really that is why I like Ellery Adams writing so much. You don't always get the expected from Ellery. I understand why some readers are upset but feel it took courage for her to write the book the way she wanted. She had to know that some would be upset. When I thought about all this, I thought that is why I like Ellery's books. She is true to her own self.\n",

      "I always enjoyed going with Olivia on her treasure hunts with Captain Haviland. I looked forward to seeing what treasure the ocean would give up. As the book neared the end, I thought she hasn't gone on her treasure hunt.. Then in the last pages, she went on the treasure hunt. I will miss this series very much.\n",

Anything good was lost in the final few chapters. If someone could somehow make it as though I'd never read the book and would never again even be tempted to pick it up, I wouldn't hesitate to pay that person $100 on the spot.\n",

      "•You see, this is actually a good book. Since I admittedly hardly have any expertise when it comes to fanfiction, I can't tell whether Bebris's are among the best ones or not, but I honestly could find nothing wrong with North by Northanger. The author clearly possesses a deep knowledge of the originals (in the case at hand, Pride and Prejudice and Northanger Abbey), which surely showed in her work, and that's probably the highest praise I could give to any book presenting itself as the continuation of such a beloved story. was fitting as well: and generally pleasing, and as close to Austen's as it humanly gets, I guess. Nothing wrong to be found with , too, though I can't say I suddenly became enamoured with any of Bebris's version of them. I think that if I rated my books merely with objectivity -with my brain rather than with my guts- this one would deserve three full stars.\n",

At one point I just couldn't wait for it to finish already. is tiresome, unexciting, (like far-fetched), utterly(seriously now) and far of babies, Lady Anne's perfection, and a horrifyingly detailed account of what is wrong with Elizabeth's management of Pemberley by Lady Catherine de Bourgh. All very nice things, you see, but all inconsequential to the plot. Result, I was bored out of my mind. And I'm not even one bit sorry.\n",

I am at least content that the supernatural elements and the annoying Professor Randolph are done away with in this book.\n",

First, Elizabeth finds a letter from Lady Anne, Darcy's mother, implying that she should search for a hidden object.

They accept the invitation, which gets them accused of theft.\n",

      "Bebris shows her knowledge of Austen mores and manners and builds up a convincing story. There is a lot of meeting and bowing and talking, which I enjoyed - a lot! The supernatural element still exists but it is kept to a minimum and the focus is basically on getting out of the legal trouble they are in and finding ivory statuettes belonging to Lady Anne. Elizabeth's pregnancy and her fights with Catherine de Bourgh were entertaining.\n",

Elizabeth is pregnant, and the Darcys have been staying in Bath to \"take the waters,\" along with Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Darcy's aunt, who never fails to insult Elizabeth. The Darcys are invited to Northanger Abbey to meet Frederick Tinley and have an extremely unusual encounter there, starting with their unaccountably strange reception by the housekeeper. They leave much sooner than they had anticipated and run into legal problems that result in Lady Catherine coming to live at Pemberly with them. But, of course, the Darcys eventually figure out what is really going on, and it all ends well. And now I need to read Northanger Abbey. :->\n",

      "This is the third entry in the Staszek crime family series. Although it's a standalone in terms of the couple, other characters and certain lines of action first appeared in previous books.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, we follow younger son Jakub and his second-chance romance with Nicole, the girl who got away five years earlier. Now, she's back in Chicago, working for one of his clubs, and threatened by a rival mobster. Can he keep her safe? And will their old feelings for each other resurface?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is much more consensual and, thus, much less \"dark\" than the other two (really, all are more \"grayish\"). This is a relief to me, but others might be disappointed. If, however, you're looking for a relatively mild erotic book featuring two likeable characters that moves at a decent pace, you'll probably enjoy this. I particularly appreciated two aspects. First (unlike his brother and brother-in-law), Jakub's actions are for -- not because he wants something from her. Second (unlike his brother and brother-in-law), he always puts her first and doesn't pander to anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have some quibbles. Although I liked Nicole's spirit, she did do some pretty foolish things. In addition, as usual with this author, there are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Plot holes/Inconsistencies: It either does or does not matter that Jakub didn't use a condom. Nicole's father did or did not leave Chicago under a cloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Plot points are introduced and then not developed: It's\n",
      ".\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Narrative aspects that make no sense: Henry's OTT feelings for Nicole, for instance. And, given that Nicole and Jakub were together for only one month and don't appear to have thought of each other in five years, I'd classify this as insta-love.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 1/2 stars which I'm raising to 4 for this: “You killed someone, Jakub, and you want to lecture me on if I was in the hallway or in the living room at the time?” , an author references the huge cognitive dissonance we have to engage in when known H's call their h's \"bad.\" Since there are no more siblings, I'm not sure whether or not they'll be other books, but a couple of lines of action are left open. Side Note: Nicole more specifically goes to UIC, not the U of I.\n",

      "In the third book of the Staszek Crime Family, Nicole gets into a Staszek owned bar with a fake I.D. along with two underage friends. Jakob Staszek is manning the bar, realizes she is underage and refuses to serve her, thinking as she is a college student, she came in with friends. He wanted to kick them out, but as her father was associated with another Polish crime family, the Kaczmarek's, she didn't snitch, even after he threatened her...so they had a brief affair before she left Chicago to go the New York...then five years later, Nicole returned to Chicago, working in marketing at a club that is expanding, KatFish...not realizing the bar is owned by the Staszek family and overseen by Jakob along with two other clubs...and they reconnect...but when she left New York, she had been seeing a man who worked for the Kaczmarek's...but you will need to read this enticing story to see what happens...I voluntarily read this book through an Advanced Reader Copy. \n",

      "After a terrifying health scare, Ander is finally getting the help he needs. He's running out of options and needs the treatment. The only thing is, he hasn't been honest with Hadley. One truth leads to a cascade of events that all circle back to one thing...Ander's addiction. Life is never easy and the road to recovery is paved with shattered glass. Hadley's in love with an addict that harbors more secrets than Pandora's Box. Ander is in love with the girl that deserves more than he can give her. Their love was built on a mountain of lies and broken promises. When it all comes crashing down, will their love survive? Or will they finally fall apart?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is one series that has really been hard on my heart. But so worth it. Your emotions are all over the place with this one too and you just are waiting for the hammer to fall the entire time. This is the story of a very toxic relationship between Ander and Hadley. He has kept a health scare hidden from her even if he could have possibly spread it to her. But he is sober right now and realizes that he has really nothing. He isn't in school and he doesn't have a job and he even still lives with his mother. All this makes him feel like he is not worthy of Hadley because she is standing on her own two feet. He couldn't take care of her if he had to. But Hadley is beginning to see just how toxic this relationship and she is willing to take a step away from her for her own well being. This book will have you in pieces wondering is these two can get the happily ever after they both want. Will Ander ever get clean? You have to read to find out. I loved this story but man it was a hard on to read.\n",

      "Captivated By Him is the third book in the Mafia Brides series, but could be read as a stand alone. Nicole and Jakub have a history together and now not only does she work for him, her ex has placed her in danger. Jakub is determined to make her his and keep her safe, and the only way to do that is to give her his family’s name. But will he give her up when the danger has passed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Another fantastic book in this series! I absolutely loved the dynamic that formed between Nicole and Jakub, I loved that they wanted to be together, and I loved their steam just as much as their tender and vulnerable moments. Neither were perfect, but they were two puzzle pieces that fit together just right. I really liked Nicole. She had so much fire and refused to back down. I loved that for as strong as her mind was and how much she wanted to make her own choices and back up her decisions, often her body was what gave her away. I just really liked how strong she was, even when she made mistakes. Jakub was pretty great, too. Just as dominant as his brother, yet he didn’t have as much of the danger aspects of his job. I liked how protective he was of what he considered his, and I liked how he didn’t feel like he measured up to his brother. They were both interesting characters that I was, dare I say it, captivated by! I really enjoyed this book! I loved all of the danger elements, I loved all of the hurdles they needed to triumph, and I really loved how this whole series has played out! Fantastic read!\n",

      "This story was absolutely fantastic! Measha Stone writes these Mafia men who are ruthless, obsessive, and truly Alpha. Jakub is definitely in that mindset when he reacquaints himself with ….. And they become explosive in their passion and sensual in their love.\n",

      "**DISCLAIMER** This is NOT your average romance. It's a dark, gritty, sometimes erotic psychological thriller with a heavy emphasis on plot. It also contains elements of dominance and discipline with dubious consent, psychological conditioning, and mental manipulation. There’s also gunfire and violence. If any of this offends you, this may not be the book for you. Intended for mature audiences only.\n",

He's on edge, everyone is a threat and it doesn't take much for him to explode.

He'd done the sweetest thing the day before and he just ruined it all in one go!!! The expectations he had were just ridiculous, he deemed some things beneath her but expected her to do the most menial things. It drove me nuts!!! Yes he's possessive but most of he's behaviour stems from trying to protect Taylor, and that's what he's doing in his own sick and twisted way. He partly likes it when Taylor shows fear, but he goes crazy if she shies away from him. Even though he gives her every reason to.\n",

I seriously didn't see a way out for Sebastian and Taylor, and I was just a little bit disappointed in Sebastian. He should have known better, especially after his conversation with Marx. I saw this coming a mile away! The violence at this point shot through the roof, there was this particular scene that was just so graphic, I guess it just got to me because I have this fear of suffocating...\n",

I don't see her as being a woman in love, I look at her as a victim, a girl with some serious family issues which drove into a hands of a monster. My biggest problem with her, and the main reason that I gave it 4 stars, was lack of informations about her family problems that made her the way she is. I felt that there was an important piece of information missing that could have explained her behavior. That could made me understand her better.\n",

      "Another riveting installment in the SKALS series! This series is not for the faint of heart, or for someone expecting a flowery romance. This is dark, gritty, and raw; but somehow it has me in its grasp and won't let go. When Sebastian is with HIS Taylor and everything is going how he expects it to go, he has got to be the most endearing, loving, and intense man there is. He loves Taylor with an intensity that goes far beyond any regular Alpha males love for their woman.\n",

This man is cold, calculated and evil to his core. He is very frightening, and he crosses the line to deliver whatever abuse he deems necessary to correct Taylor's behaviour. He does this with no guilt, as he feels he is doing her a favor, and teaching her how to make sure she never makes the same mistake twice.\n",
      "\n",
      "What has me boggled with this story, is the fact that Taylor puts up with this. Mind you, when everything is going well, Sebbie is a dream come true for her; but when it is bad, the terror that she has for the man that she loves does nothing but confuse her.\n",

I feel I should hate him with all of my being; but instead I am able to understand why Sebastian is the way he is. I have my fingers crossed that as the series progresses, Seb will begin to develop more patience and gentleness. Even if he doesn't, I am caught in his web, and I'm hanging on for dear life!!

      "Damn... Book 2 was just as amazing as book 1 ! I've got a new author to add to my top favorites list and Adriana Noir is it! She has created the perfect anti-hero.. the guy you love to hate at times, hate to love other times, and then just full out love. Arrrrhhhhhhh! I wanted to smack Seb around so bad sometimes. He's just... he's one of a kind. He's uber possessive and very controlling. He's a total wicked bad ass.. he's as tough as they come and he takes no shit and no prisoners. However... this time around we get to get a little deeper and see even more of the compassionate side of Seb this time around.. There's some serious bad dudes out there after him and his SKALS team but mainly Sebastian. The baddies will go after Seb anyway they can..even if it means going after his biggest weak spot.. which happens to be Taylor. Taylor has been a balm to Seb's soul.. she's everything to him. But as much as he loves her.. he's still very controlling and he takes \"obey\" to a whole other level. Like ... seriously another level. Dude is cray cray sometimes. I would literally get goosebumps when Taylor would do something that I just knew was going make him go all defcon 1 on her ass.\n",

His life demands order and sometimes the really bad shit he has to go through bleeds over into his personal life. His strong demands that Taylor do exactly what he says and how he says it are for a reason.... his on crazy bad ass dude reasons.. but reasons none the less.\n",

      "\"As we live through the Anthropocene, our current epoch of human-made disaster, a new book, Elvia Wilk’s 'Death by Landscape,' argues compellingly that giving more space to the weird can help us reconsider our relationships to nature—and, even in the face of institutional inertia, exercise greater responsibility to each other.\" — Michael Friedrich\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I feel like this is the type of book one might appreciate if you wanted to feel like an intellectual about the state of the world without having to do very much work about what that actually means. Much of my issues with this book come from the fact that Wilk clearly knows how to use the language of progressivism, yet many of the ideas she puts forth (particularly in Plants) echo ecofascist talking points. She generalizes humanity's relationship with nature as purely negative and extractive over and over again. She follows this up by saying maybe it would be good for the Earth if humanity vanished. Now, this line of reasoning is unfortunately very common. If you don't spend much time reading intersectional environmental literature, it's easy to fall into the idea that all people, everywhere, are bad for nature. Wilk provided very little in the way to counteract this troubled reasoning, and essentially advocated we should all just accept our inevitable change/death. It irks me that someone who supposedly spent so much time reading environmental works could not see how harmful this particular attitude is to hold, especially for marginalized groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "That glaring issue aside, I think her essays shined the most when they focused on her personal experiences. The epilogue was perhaps the most resonant part of this book for me, but I can't say I can recommend the rest of it very strongly. You need to spend a lot of time picking apart the arguments in this book, or else you run the risk of tacitly agreeing with some pretty uninformed/borderline dangerous viewpoints, which I fear many who read this book have done. Wilk is clearly a talented author in terms of her writing skills, so this makes it really easy to agree with a bad argument dressed up in lace.\n",
      "\n",
      "One book I will recommend in place of this one and touches upon similar ideas is Robin Wall Kimmerer's Braiding Sweetgrass. Kimmerer is able to provide the image of hope in the face of climate change that Wilk is unable to deliver, and also comes from both a personal and scientific background that better inform her views about the environment and how people form relationships with it.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This collection of essays takes its title from a short story by Margaret Atwood (which can be found in her 1991 collection Wilderness Tips) which is, on a very basic level, about humanity's relationship with the natural world (which is hardly an unusual theme for Atwood, of course), but also self-identity, the nature of perception, the nature of loss, environmentalism, feminism...all of which themes inform Wilk's interconnected essays as she discusses various books, films, and writers.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there's a single overlying concept to , it's a defence of genre writing—the importance of non-mainstream perspective and the utility of alternative or speculative story-telling—as Wilk discusses writers and books from the Old/New Weird (, ) to body-horror (, ) to sci-fi/cli-fi (, ) to cyberpunk/solarpunk (, ) to medieval mystics and 'alternative' philosophers (Hildegaard Von Bingen, r).\n",
      "\n",
      "I did find it interesting to read Wilk's take on these subjects...but I do wonder who exactly the readership for these essays might be...and whether I might be the best or the worst target audience (which is something I wondered about her Berlin-set, Creatives-charactered novel, ). I must say that I am already familiar with the majority of the books and authors Wilk writes about in this collection. Not that I didn't learn anything or wasn't inspired to seek out the writers I was unfamiliar with (, for example), but I wonder whether a reader who is less familiar with these books and genres (and/or vice versa) would appreciate ?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, what I found most engaging about the collection were the more personal elements—Wilk writing about her own methods and work habits, in particular the genesis of (which included a LARPing session of the book!)—even if, again, I found this relatable on a personal level, as it seemed reflective of some of my own work habits.\n",

      "DEATH BY LANDSCAPE by Elvia Wilk is a stellar collection of essays! Once I got into this book I couldn’t put it down! These essays discuss women relating to nature, literary works, larping and her writing process. I found every essay extremely interesting! I’d tell you my fave essays but half of them were my faves. Sometimes I find it hard to articulate what I love about a book and that’s the case with this one. I just loved reading it! If you’re looking for you’re next non fiction read then pick this one up! I’m so eager to read Wilk’s novel Oval now! Luckily I checked and my library has it!!\n",

      "Voor mij gaat het boek over het plezier van graven, het plezier van connectie zoeken en het plezier van het kijken naar onze plek in de wereld, waarom we die plek hebben en of het er eigenlijk wel toe doet om daar over na te denken. Ik kan het iedereen aanraden, de ervaring van het lezen alleen al was bijna meditatief. De rustige manier waarop Elvia Wilk filosofeert en referenties aan elkaar rijgt, openden ook iets bij mij. Het lezen van Death by landscape voelde op veel manieren als ademen, en ik had telkens het gevoel wat meer uitgerust te zijn nadat ik weer een paar pagina's had gelezen. Het boek ging een tijdje lang overal mee naartoe, in mijn jaszak. Dat gevoel ga ik nu missen, maar veel stukken zullen nog lang bij me blijven.\n",

      "Hot Sexy Warrior Mermen. Oh My!!\n",
      "\n",
      "The start was good, but a little slow. It took some time for me to get into the book. As for the characters they aren’t overly complicated. Ms. Night does a good job of explaining her mermen, throwing in a little about Atlantis and what it once was, and how the council is set on their old ways when others can see that that way is killing them and they need to change.\n",

      "Torun is a merman and Lucy is a modern day women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Torun defies the Council and he has to work on convincing Lucy that she is his. If not the punishment is harsh. As for Lucy she does a lot of protesting in her head, why this or that etc. It got a little old, but not to over powering to make me dislike her. It reminding me of all women. We like to over think things. I really liked that Torun can sense Lucy’s feelings and faces them head on instead of like Lucy’s ex-husband who dropped her as soon as she was a burden. The romance was sweet. The love scenes are warm and gentle, not over powering.\n",

      "One of my favorite parts in this story are the guardians. They are just fun, adorable, and wonderful. If I lived under the sea, I’d want one as a friend/pet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their where two things that made me go hmm. One scene was close to the beginning that had me going, oh no are they going to sleep together even though they don’t know each other? Please no, but thankfully the author didn’t do this and gives our hot merman Torun a chance to convince Lucy that she is his destined woman. The other thing that I found strange is that Lucy leaves her Sea Opel with one of her interns on her boat when they go back out sea. This intern is a stranger and well her ex stole the first one, so why trust this person you don’t know? It felt opposite of what her character would have done.\n",

      "While the plot was interesting enough, the writing and the world-building could definitely use some work. It was a little confusing cause I can't decide whether the underwater world is supposed to be all high tech like from Aquaman or like a caveman tribal behind the times version and that's just one of the inconsistencies.\n",

      "So overview, I feel like the book leaves much to be desired especially since it hasn't convinced me to read the next book but at the same time I strangely really wanna read Aya's book (i.e book three) and Starla has a Dragon series and that word alone is my crack and I'm so weak.\n",

It was ridiculous and entertaining that way but after a while, I lost interest. I wish I could have cared for the characters or the plot a bit more but it was alright overall. I enjoyed the silliness. I don't think I'll be reading more from this series but who knows, maybe I'll change my mind when the right challenge task comes along.\n",

      "Seduced by the sea lord follows Torun, a merman warlord and Lucy, a human girl who mistook him for a dead body. She brought him back up from the sea and miraculously, he survived. Even better than that, apparently the light he sees in her means she's supposed to be his mate, his \"mermaid queen\". They'll have children, yada yada yada, you know it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucy, however, doesn't believe him at first (who would?) but she finds it okay to make out with him in her boat lmao. Anyway, she's had a bad break up with her ex-husband and is insecure about her being able to have children. After a while, she got on my nerve. She was a bit too needy to my taste.\n",

      "This book should be required reading for educators at all levels. Like all great ideas, Understanding by Design presents a process that seems like common sense, is surprisingly difficult to implement properly, but could have astounding results. The premise behind Understanding by Design is that learning doesn't happen by accident, or merely by hard work on the part of students and teachers, but from the deliberate mastery of skills in pursuit of hard questions. Understanding by Design doesn't require much more work on the part of teachers than other approaches, but requires great courage and clarity in describing what is being learned, and why.\n",
      "\n",
      "UbD centers around understanding, and the idea that when students really get something, they're able to perform effectively with knowledge and wisely transfer what they've learned across domains, rather than simply reciting facts or plugging through the steps of an algorithm. \"Understanding\" is a slippery phrase that is somewhat unfashionable. For example it's not in the original 1956 Bloom's and is relegated to a basic level in subsequent revisions, but the word serves better than any other to mark the difference between someone who gets it, and someone who has not yet. The common enemies of understanding are 'coverage without context', textbook driven learning akin to reading the encyclopedia A-Z, and 'activities without purpose', hands-on activities that do not connect back to a larger point. Rather, the goal is to help students Big Questions for themselves; the eternal scholarly and humanistic debates that link back to individual life experience and mastery over specialized skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Desired understanding must be linked to a proper assessment of that understanding. Here, Wiggins and McTighe make their single strongest pedagogic claim, that understanding can only truly be measured by authentic performance-based tasks, typically complex and realistic and built around creating reasoned and supported answers, so that a student may be successfully proven to have learned something. Assessment is a also a continuous process, and UbD recommends a continuous feedback loop of practice and evaluation, as well as 'one-minute essays' at the close of class about what students have learned and what they are confused about. The book supports realistic assessment over teaching to the test with a survey of major research that shows that better performing countries have realistic problem-based assessment, and that this method when used in America, leads to improvements in all schools, with the greatest improvements in deprived under-performing schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final step, planning for learning, connects understandings and assessments to the daily practice of what is done in the classroom. This section is the least developed, introducing the WHERETO heuristic, but mostly leaving it up to educators to decided what in their box of tools is appropriate for the situation. It's a fair trade-off, given that they need to supply advice for teachers in every topic from K-16, but it annoyed me that just when we're about to get our hands dirty, the book backs off to a level of abstraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good teachers will know everything in this book intuitively. Hesitant, or less well-prepared teachers (ahem, junior faculty) will benefit from having some wise words to justify what they know is right. Organizations will benefit from a common plan and language for building up binders full of good classes. This is a wonderfully crafted, action-oriented, theoretically grounded, guide for creating classes that matter, rather than classes that merely have to be completed. If you're going to read one book about teaching and curriculum make it\n",

      "As a rule, if I review a book, I read every word of the book. There have been a few exceptions (this brings the total up to 4, I believe...)\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a lot of good content in this one. The concept is pretty solid, and I think most teachers are using Backward Design by now. I remember learning about it in my undergrad methods courses, but it wasn't nearly as in depth as it was here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, as the title implies - you start with what you want kids to know, and develop the curriculum from there. It's always nice to have a little direction, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "This idea is generally accepted when it comes to teaching, best practice, educational theory, etc... unless we're talking about the standardized tests which mean so much these days. In case, you have no idea what's going to be on the test and try your best to guess which standards are going to appear this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" I hear you arguing, \"Isn't the test based on the standards? Why not just teach \"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ahhhh... you obviously haven't been in a classroom, or not a 7th grade social studies classroom - with standards from prehistory to present. Any fact, colony, religion, government, country, etc... from Africa, Asia, or Oceania... fair game. The state has all that to pull from, and I've still seen questions that weren't from our standards on there... for example, they might ask for the name of a country in the Western Hemisphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I digress. The book is good. I didn't read every word, because a lot of it was very repetitive and used specific examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "At any rate, new teachers are starting with Backward Design. Seasoned teachers are using Backward Design due to 20-40 years of trial and error: they know the direction they want to go because they've been there a thousand times.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Understanding by Design is a technical publication for building curriculum using the backward design process. This book helps instructors support their work by implementing Essential Questions so that a course can be built around the end result and focused on understanding rather than milestones and tasks. It is a pretty basic lesson planning guide – almost a 101 for teachers of anything. It lacks a few fundamental ideas, such as using taxonomy as a basis for questioning, but I think that the book's primary focus is on building of courses, lessons, and units rather than pedagogical technique.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few things I like about it – it teaches the concepts and also manages to include applicable strategies and forms that will help the instructor build their unit. It is also well written. Some things I don't like is that it is unnecessarily wordy in many places, and it contains many useless graphics that illustrate ideas that are not really difficult for anyone to grasp. One final note is that the author uses unnecessary humor at times that I think really just adds to the wordiness of some topics that are relatively simple to grasp.\n",

UbD describes a set of strategies useful for university students and first graders, science classes and physical education.

Obviously, impossible.\n",

For Wiggins and McTighe, understanding is not vague and wishy-washy, but complicated and multifaceted, with the depth to be used in different contexts.

      "I’ve been taking a fairly intensive faculty development course over the last month, but felt that my questions about objectives weren’t sufficiently addressed within the course. I’ve meant to read for several years. I wish I’d read this beforehand. I’m glad I read it, even afterwards.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "All right. What did I think of this book that I will have to teach beginning in August?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was okay?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am most likely going to ramble a bit, I apologize in advance.\n",

      "The premise and main message of the book is good. Basically it's advocating that all teachers purposefully design their units and curriculum around the premise that students should understand the big ideas undergirding the content of the course, rather than covering a certain amount of information. Frankly, I'm not entirely sure why this even needed to be written, isn't that common sense? Alas, I think that this book was written as a response to American public school education, and I, having never attended an American public school, or indeed any public school, have never experienced the kind of teaching the book excoriates, 'coverage', where you march through a textbook and memorize facts and never engage with the wheretoes and the whyfores of those facts. I'm thinking back to both my homeschool classes and my boarding school classes...yes, I attended a boarding school, it makes me sound so snobby or 19th century...but one, I lived close enough to not have to board, as did most of the students, and two, there's not many other options in Ecuador, if you want to get a decent education...Anyway. I can't remember a class where we didn't engage with underlying ideas. Maybe not all of the underlying ideas that the book talks about, in all subject areas, but what educational system could? At the very least home-schooling successfully instilled in me the ability of autonomous learning, being self-motivated, and seeking after learning for the pleasure of it. Apparently that's the holy grail of this book, and one of the goals of this curriculum design framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other main idea of the book is that a curriculum should be designed backwards. That you should clearly delineate the goal of what you want the students to learn, apply or perform, then build the curriculum towards that goal: designing scaffolding, activities, assignments and rubrics that all build to that goal, rather than doing activities for the sake of activities that don't really have any bearing on your stated goal. Again...I'm not entirely certain why that needed to be written. Isn't that common sense? Apparently not. Seriously, what is taught in education classes at the college level? Is the reason that I find this ludicrous because I skipped the undergrad education courses and went straight to the graduate level? Or is it because I went for a TESOL degree and you kind of have to teach with specific language goals in mind if you want to have any success? Or is it because I was forced to teach in a coverage aspect at my first job and was excessively frustrated by it because it obviously didn't work, therefore there must be a better way? Or is it that I just gained this knowledge implicitly because of being homeschooled? I don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come to think of it though, the statistic classes that I have taken have all followed the cardinal sins of this book. They march through a bunch of discrete skills and you never learn how to apply it to messy real life data, you just have to sort of infer it. This works for things like means, and medians, and even standard deviations, but once you get into inferential statistics...how are you supposed to know which test you are supposed to use, on which data set, to get which prediction? I haven't the foggiest most of the time. Can I even use these tests with my data as it is not normally distributed?\n",
      "\n",
      "The other cardinal sin this book mentions is that students walk away being able to quote facts but not being able to articulate the underlying ideas behind those facts. That is true, and I think exacerbated by internet culture. When people are arguing on the internet, they post a paper, or an article backing up their point...but they never make a point. They're like 'you're wrong' paper linked. That doesn't actually demonstrate that I am wrong, and even less does it demonstrate that you are right. It demonstrates that you lack the ability to make your own argument. It's particularly frustrating because so often they depend on the headline or the abstract and assume that it says what they want it to say, but when you read the actual article it disproves their point. This has happened to me, multiple times. It makes me bemoan the problems with literacy in the western world. Something is obviously not working in how we teach argumentation skills and reading skills. That or humans are just inherently lazy and can't be bothered to actually pursue knowledge and take the easiest route.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book did have really good pointers and a couple of good personal/professional development tools. Self-assessment of lessons and units is critical, and is often not done. Repetition of lessons and units across years is critical, and is often not done. It took me about five years to get my Freshman English curriculum really refined and useful at my last university. The first time you teach a class: it's crap. Sorry. Just facts. You don't really have a lot of time to plan, you are inundated with meetings, classes, grading, and you are struggling to keep your head above the water. You do your best to design a class that meets the needs of your students, but you don't really have enough experience to even know what the needs of your particular demographic of students are. The first year is all experimentation, you try things, they don't work, you try other things that do, and you save those things and then reincorporate them into next year. Slowly, each year, things get better and more streamlined, until finally you have a product that is actually useful. Teaching, lesson planning and curriculum design is a process and inherently takes time and that is a point that this book was careful to make and that needs to be made. I have seen teachers avoid this process. They teach each unit once, even though they have the same class, they get bored so they never review or edit what they teach and instead go on to something different each year. One, that's a ton of extra work, two, that treats every year like the first year, and three, their curriculum design never really improves. I've seen the other extreme, where a teacher does use the same unit every year, and never changes it...that blows my mind. So I can see why this book felt the need to address that topic, that's obviously a problem and needs to be corrected.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand. I didn't like the book! I didn't like the writers! I felt that there was way too much unnecessary jargon. I felt that they are too insistent on following their \"WHERETO\" acronym...which I found obtuse and impossible to remember, let alone implement. I got very sick of their assumptions of things as facts...even as they advocated questioning everything! Gah! It's the postmodern Achilles heel: \"Question everything: except postmodernism.\" \"The meaning of a text is what you make of it, not necessarily what the author meant to convey.\" That's stupid. Yes, each person walks away with a subtly different take on the book that they read. My feeling that the authors of this book are sometimes pompous may not be what they intended to pass on. But that really only applies to secondary aspects of the text. If I walk away from this book with the received meaning: I should teach by covering a ton of information, I have completely missed the point of the book! They specifically acknowledge that a text's purpose is to communicate specific information in how they are constantly having 'misapprehension alerts'. Don't misunderstand what we are writing. I always wonder if they apply this to the spoken word too. It seems to me that when you take this philosophy to it's logical extreme then you are denying the ability to communicate ideas at all. Yes, in our inner mind when someone says 'cup' we all represent that word differently. Some have a mental representation of a black mug, some have a glass, some have a tea cup, some have pictures in their head, some have words, but we all agree on certain aspects, it's a container to hold liquid, that all follow the same basic shape of having sides taller than the width of the base. If we didn't all agree on this same basic meaning, communication would be impossible. If I decided to associate 'cup' with a flat piece of paper used to mark my place in a book, I would be wrong. The same is true when you string words into phrases, sentences, and texts. There is a distinct meaning you wish to convey. Some of the trimmings don't necessarily matter, or you leave up to the imagination of the reader to fill in the gaps, but the core meaning doesn't change and isn't open to interpretation, if it was language would not communicate.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that part bothered me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other part that bothered me was the facets of understanding: application, empathy, explanation, interpretation, perspective and self-knowledge. I'm sorry. I don't think these are all equally important. I don't. I don't think empathy should be on the same par as application, explanation and interpretation. To be brutally honest, I don't think perspective and self-knowledge are on the same level either. Self-assessment is important, you need to be able to look and see when something isn't working and correct. I don't think seeing things from other perspectives or having empathy with those other perspectives is important in all subject areas. What is the use of looking at mathematics empathically? What is the use of looking at other perspectives in mathematics at a basic level, or even an algebraic level? What is there to be empathic about in science? In history or literature, cultural studies or linguistic studies, I get it, it's important. But what is practical about teaching different perspectives on numbers in K-12 education? Our goal should be to prepare students for living in the real world, where numbers have concrete meanings and equations have practical uses. Sure, teach them that this works because we accept a priori certain numerical relationships, but also teach them that we accept these a priori beliefs because it works in the world we live in. If in higher education they want to go on to explore other mathematical systems, go for it, but I don't think that belongs in elementary education. There's a reason it's called elementary. It's supposed to be about the basics.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also see a problem with the over emphasis of empathy in our culture at large. We so often empathize with one person to the exclusion of the other person or people involved. In our rush to empathize with the victim of society, we forget to empathize with the needs of the other people in society. You can see this in the homeless problem we have now. We empathize with people who have mental illness and don't want to put them in homes, because we value self-determination and think that everyone should have it. But, when the mentally ill take over public parks and sidewalks because of this value, now those who have the right to use those parks and sidewalks in safety cannot because they are occupied by those who have a tenuous grasp on reality and behave in unpredictable and often dangerous ways. Our empathy with one group has overridden our empathy for another. This is a constant problem in our society today, because we prioritize certain groups over others, because of a perceived lack of power, or of historical wrongs done against that group. If empathy were applied to every group equally it would be fine, but we are hierarchical creatures, even when we claim not to be, we empathize with certain groups and exclude others. We need to empathize with the feelings of the native Americans as their land was taken from them. Yes, we do. But we also need to empathize with the feelings of the settlers. They were not inhuman, they had motivations, understandable ones, for what they did. It's not this group is wholly good and put upon, and this group is wholly evil and predatory, but so often in the name of empathy this is what ends up being taught. We are reactionary, we go from one extreme to the other. From manifest destiny to colonization is inherently evil. All we are doing is reacting and swinging to the opposite extreme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway. There were good aspects in the book. There were aspects I didn't like. One thing that I shall COMPLETELY take to heart is that it says that textbooks are not a syllabus, they are a resource, and sections should be pulled out because they meet your goals, not because you feel it necessary to cover all the information in them. I shall take this to heart by not teaching everything in this book, and choosing the chapters that I think are most relevant to the goal of helping students learn to create a curriculum that is well-designed. I'm not sure they meant it to be applied to their book, but it shall be.\n",

      "Larissa Whitcomb is no stranger to loss. After the death of her daughter, the disappearance of her son, and the end of her marriage, she finds herself in a state of grief so overwhelming, it’s hard to cope. Just when she thinks that everything is returning to some form of sanity, there is another truth to drop that shakes her core. Our story follows Larissa as she tries to piece together the fragments of her once idyllic life and the resilience and hope she learns along the way. Kind strangers, positive affirmations, and seemingly out of nowhere symbols of peace, Larissa finds her grief waning at unexpected moments. Though it can never be forgotten, we find that it can become less of a burden to bear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be still my heart- as it was broken several times in the reading of this book. I laughed, I cried, and I hoped right along side Larissa it seems. Jennifer Collins does such a great job of illustrating the process of grief in her book, Comfort in the Wings. With the apt descriptions and inner monologues of the main character, each chapter brought on a new level of empathy in me as a reader. I could tell that there was a lot of work and research that went into this book as overly unidentified processes were brought to light and how cruel they can be to a grieving family. Jennifer Collins did not want to skip any part of Larissa’s mourning and it shows.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d give this book a 5/5 from pure emotion alone. Of course, there are other aspects to my rating; character development, plot, and realism are all impeccable- especially for a first time novelist. The key feature, as I mentioned above, is the emotion. This book will make you cry, whether it be in sadness or joy. I would recommend this book to all those who have experienced loss and even those who haven’t as the empathy the book gives you is truly astounding.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "COMFORT IN THE WINGS is not just for those who have suffered unbearable loss. Collins has Larissa experience just about every emotion on the spectrum. Readers can identify with her conflict, indecision, fear and perseverance as Collins weaves together a few plotlines, a little mystery, a love story, and hope.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Comfort in the Wings is a must read! I felt honored and privileged to experience the main character Larissa’s journey after a devastating loss. The author offers us a raw, genuine glimpse of Larissa’s pain, as well as her hope as she tries to shape a new existence vis a vis “before” and “after.” I also truly appreciated the quotes at the start of every chapter. They helped me stop and take a breath, and beautifully set the stage for what was to come next in the story. I could not choose just one; here are the two that resonated most. Chapter 27 Water does not resist. Water flows. When you plunge your hand into it, all you feel is a caress. Water is not a solid wall, it will not stop you. But water always goes where it wants to go, and nothing in the end can stand against it. Water is patient. Dripping water wears away a stone. Remember that, my child. Remember you are half water. If you can’t go through an obstacle, go around it. Water does. (Margaret Atwood). Chapter 32 Just when the caterpillar thought the world was over, she became a butterfly. (Proverb). Again, this is a must read for us all - thank you Jennifer Collins!\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Comfort in the Wings is a page turner, with an emotional core that makes you want more! I really enjoyed the characterizations of all the main players as well as the strangers Larissa runs into on her journey! I felt like I could relate to her and her fears as well as her joy while experiencing heartbreaking loss. This debut novel by a talented writer is surely one you will want on your nightstand!\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I realize my giving Comfort in the Wings three stars differs markedly from most of the other reviews. This is an example of not every book is for every reader, but there are readers for whom this book will be a comfort and will provide solace.\n",
      "\n",
      "I chose to read Comfort in the Wings by Jennifer Collins with some trepidation. When I read that Collins had suffered so many losses in her family, including the deaths of two of her children within months of each other, I was not sure I could read the book, having lost one of my sons five years ago and having lost my best friend recently. Now, the book is a novel with this blurb on the front cover: “A novel inspired by love that will not die.” Those words certainly rang true for me. My son and my best friend are no longer here with me, but I continue to love them with the same fierce love as always.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jennifer Collins, retired physical therapist and college professor, has had a busy career. She says, though, being a mom has been most important to her and has “brought the most joy and pride.” Collins has written fiction and nonfiction. In Comfort in the Wings, Collins explores loss, coping, and a journey toward hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collins explains that her friends encouraged her to write a “survival guide” for others who are grieving. Somehow, that choice did not seem right to her. She chose, instead, to write a novel based on her experiences, but a novel also gives her freedom to explore.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have found Comfort in the Wings to be affirming in many ways. At the same time, I have found the writing a bit stilted. I wished for a more conversational flow. I am quite certain that Comfort in the Wings will, indeed, bring solace to those seeking it. For certain book clubs, Comfort in the Wings will generate a thoughtful discussion. The issues of loss and grief are certainly universal ones.\n",

      "Christina Nelson knows how to write an emotion-tugging book!\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy a book about a woman coming home to care for her aging aunt suffering from Parkinson's. It did take me a while to warm up to the main character Cassie, and I'm not entirely sure that I fully succeeded even in the end. She's quite stubborn and resistant to help from anyone, despite her exhaustion and being overwhelmed. She has an adorable young daughter Lark, who is precocious and added a great deal of comic relief along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think what made this book more compelling was the mystery surrounding Cassie's past. She receives a mysterious story and as she reads it, she starts to think that it might be about her. I was fully invested in the tale to find out how the story tied into Cassie's life. I'm not sure I completely bought the way everything came together in the conclusion and I had to read through it a couple of times to puzzle out the connections. I think my main problem was that there is a side storyline of another woman in town learning things about her own past, and for whatever reason I thought the two stories were going to end up being connected and they weren't. I kept trying to connect them the entire time and that's why I got so confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two other things that elevate this novel are the emotional impact and the setting. The Oregon coast is my stomping grounds, and everything about the descriptions of the small town and the coastline were familiar and vivid. As Cassie grows to understand that her aunt's time is short, she has to come to terms with losing the woman who has functioned as her mother for most of her life. This is heart wrenching and the emotions are so real, I definitely shed some tears. I wished I had been able to know Aunt Shasta as part of the story, before she developed her illness, so I could have made a connection with her. As it was, we just get Cassie's point of view about their relationship and it lacks some depth.\n",
      "\n",

      "Moral/theme: This novel contained themes of family and second chances.\n",

      "\n",
      "Romance: Clean. Just kissing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Writing: This is the first book I've read by Christina Suzann Nelson. Her writing style fit well with the story, but I wasn't a fan of how some major events, especially near the end, were summarized.\n",

      "Ms. Nelson pens stories that make you think. Her characters are flawed, strong and well represented.\n",
      "Cassie has always wondered who her real mother was even though she was raised by a loving relative, her Aunt Shasta. Coming home to care for Shasta who has health issues, Cassie again begins to search for answers. She brings her delightful four year old daughter, Lark, back to Oregon. Lark is a bright spot in this book of deep subjects. The author has captured the actions of this tiny girl. Ms. Nelson portrays Cassie as very caring of Shasta and Lark as she tries to juggle life. “Caregiving was a maze that surprised Cassie with new obstacles at every turn.” But Cassie finds strength in her friends and returns to her childhood faith. She begins to hope for a better future. “ Cassie, you are who God designed you to be, you are growing and changing all the time, and it may seem like you are lost in all the mess of life sometimes, but your identity is not in your name, your hair color, your job or your academic achievements. It is in your heart.”\n",
      "With a touch of mystery and a touch of romance you will want to follow along on the journey of Cassie, Lark and Shasta.\n",

      "Wow! I’m speechless. The mystery woven in was jaw dropping and to me painted a picture of how Christ loves us so much, even more than a mother’s unconditional love. I could definitely identify with Cassie and the overwhelming feelings of caring for her aunt under hospice as I recently did that for nine months for my mother. The author was spot on capturing the thoughts and feelings of not being up to the task and the rewards involved in what God has called you to do. Lark was an added bonus to the story as she brought smiles and joy. My minor complaint is that I wish that Cassie and Nora’s relationship had developed more. Maybe we can have a sequel. I loved the family that was formed of community and caring for each other. I recommend putting this on your must read list as it is well rounded with friends, family, faith, mystery, and a side helping of romance.\n",

      "Perfect couple and so different from the pattern.\n",
      "Both MCs suffer of PTSD , Vail more so then Rosalind, because he was enslaved, controlled ,violated and subjected to torture 4000 years by the dark witch Loren killed in the first book.\n",
      "Rosalind is trying to cope with the fact that she has taken lives in the war between the 3rd and 5th Realm ( you can see her in action at the end of book 2).She is kidnapped and taken as slave by the new demon king of the 5 th Realm and forced to heal his injured warriors. Her powers are bound by dark magic so she is pretty much defenseless.When a new man is brought for her to heal, she feels a deep connection to him, and soon learns that he might be exactly what her grandmother predicted for her.\n",
      "Rosalind is the perfect mate for Vail, for he is not a man that is easy to be around. His schizo episodes, anger outbursts, blackouts and nightmares made him unpredictable and a real threat for her, but she handled him like a pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved that this was a slow burn, it took lots of work on Vail for him to open up and slowly learn to overcome his hatred and darkness. I also liked that this book centered on them as a growing pair, and had less secondary characters income. We still get plenty of action and steam and swoon moments, but mostly heartbreaking ones when in Vail's mind.\n",

      "Wow! Just, wow! The Eternal Mates series is one of my favorites and each book just makes me love it more. I was hooked by Kissed by a Dark Prince then after reading Claimed by a Demon King I thought that Heaton couldn't possibly create a better story, but I was wrong folks! Tempted by a Rogue Prince is now at the top of my favorite paranormal/fantasy book list. Vail, aptly known as the \"Mad Elf Prince\", tore my heart to shreds. I had to consistently tell myself to suck those tears back in. Be strong. It's a story. It's not really happening. Let me tell you, none of that helped. If you are sensitive to the suffering, torture, and self loathing of a strong male character, Vail just may leave you a quivering and blubbering mess. Oh my heavens, Heaton got me good with this one. I loved every one of the tear dabbing, snot sniffing scenes with Vail. I loved this book so much that I don't even know where to begin or how to properly convey just how much I appreciated the journey Heaton took me on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Vail and Rosalind are confused by and fighting against prophecies dictated to them regarding their mates. Vail knows that his mate was to be a witch and after what he suffered at the hands of Kordula he wants nothing more than to destroy anyone who embodies the same magic that was used against him. Rosalind on the other hand is living with the knowledge that when she finds her mate it will lead to her death. Neither is looking for or wanting a mate and under the circumstances that they find themselves love is the last thing on their minds.\n",
      "\n",
      "You get a strong engrossing story way before you get the sexiness with this one. There isn't a real sex scene until after the 60% mark and I assure you that you won't miss it. Keeping Vail and Rosalind from coming together physically until later is especially important to the realism of their story. There simply is no way that Vail could have been open to a real relationship with Rosalind after suffering through over 4,000 years of being controlled and tortured by a dark witch. Rosalind was a perfect blend of compassion with a strong sense of morality and strength, intelligence, and perseverance.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are also introduced to an incubus by the name of Fenix, a new secondary character that I now need to read more about because his story will revolve around a horrible curse that could also be another awesome ride. Heaton is good at throwing these little firecrackers into her story that peaks your interest, leaves you wanting to know more, but somehow still doesn't take away from the main story at hand. Yes, Felicity Heaton is a tease of a writer, but I love her for it. If you are a paranormal romance fan do yourself a favor and start this series now. The stories are engaging, both the male and female characters are dynamic, interesting, and multi-layered, and best of all the series is still at the beginning and there are set ups for many more stories to come. I'm am now anxiously awaiting stories for Bleu, Grave, and now Fenix. Oh, the sweet, sweet, pain of waiting for a favorite character's featured story. The next book in the Eternal Mates series is Hunted by a Jaguar it will be Kyter/Iolanthe's story and is due January 2015 so you have plenty of time to read the first three books and be all caught up for it's release.\n",

      "Vail is the \"mad elf prince\" striking fear in all the paranormal world. But Vail is not \"mad\" by choice. He was driven to it over centuries of being under the spell of a dark witch. He was forced to kill people.  Much like Zsadist in the BDB series by J.R. Ward, Vail was sexually abused, well really he was repeatedly raped by the dark witch. It's no wonder why Vail would hate all witches much like Uilleam MacRieve. They both hate witches because of how they were abused by one and both of their fated mates are witches.\n",

But Rosalind is a light witch and does her best not to hurt people and has a strong connection to nature. Much like Vail, Rosalind is dealing with PTSD, seeing blood brings her back to the battlefield where she had to kill to say alive.\n",

      "\n",
      "Tempted by a Rouge Prince is book three in the Eternal Mates series by Felicity Heaton. Another Amazing Spectacular read by Ms. Heaton! I have been waiting on the edge of my seat for Vail’s tail ever since he was introduced in Kissed by a Dark Prince. I was blown away by the emotional, heart-wrenching, action packed adventure. We start off just after the second book and the battle that took place in Hell. \n",
      "\n",
      ", our Mad Elf Prince, brother to Loren. He was tricked and used by a dark witch several millennia ago. Now he suffers emotional and mental issues. You see throughout the series that he is trying so hard to fight the witch who has him under her control. His battle to find some peace for himself is just starting. Ms. Heaton did an amazing job showing us the battle inside. The conflicting emotions and desires that go through Vail were well done and I was crying at times just from how much I felt for him.\n",

      ", a witch, Vail’s mate his Little Wild Rose as he calls her. She has been avoiding any contact with the elves; because of a prediction her grandmother gave her. This has made her a hermit (sorta) unable to live her life; because of the fear of the prediction. In Claimed by a Demon King she ends up helping in the battle, but in doing so ends up a prisoner to those she fought and now battles nightmares of what she did in the war. Ms. Heaton did a fabulous job with Rosalind. I was not sure if she would be strong enough to help Vail, but she finally faces her fear to embrace life and love. I enjoyed the struggles she went through both physical and emotional. \n",
      "\n",
      "I just love the series. Ms. Heaton does an amazing job of bring together everything a PNR needs. The writing style flows easily and the story pulls you in making it so hard to put the book down. Remarkable plot and character development. The action battle scenes where so real and detailed. The sex was fantastic and the connection the character’s make are well matched. \n",

The towns want protection from other wolf packs and the Alpha of the Lazarus pack wants a human mate who will bear them pups. Turns out female werewolves are non-fertile.

      "Oh lordy, what a book. There are two sides to a train track - the good side and the 'other side of the track.' A young boy and his brother live on the 'other side' and have to deal with their low life mom and dad. One of the brothers' best friends lives on the good side and the story begins.\n",
      "This story is about how to deal with adversity and what do you want out of life. Do you just stand still and let things happen or do you try and make a way or find a way to better your life?\n",
      "A well deserved 5-star rating.\n",

      "I got my hands on an Advanced Reader Copy of this book as this is a local author where I live. I had a hard time putting this one down. Bravo! The story is based on the author's life growing up on \"the wrong side of the tracks.\" It was at times heartfelt and at others heartbreaking. I loved the song lyrics for the titles! It challenged me to reflect on my own beliefs. Great read!\n",

      "I read this entire book in one afternoon and night. That is rare for me. This book takes the story it wants to tell, has to tell, and tells it in exactly the way it needed to. When it’s brutal it’s brutal because it has to be, and when it’s hopeful it’s hopeful because the story takes you there and you feel like you’ve gone somewhere with it. Read it.\n",

      "Okay, my 'laugh out loud' tag may seem a little extra here, but I did chuckle. There are a few good one liners here that added to the fun nature of the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me also clarify my rating here. I'm the kind of person who keeps buying succulents because I hear they are easy to grow, but I kill them. I want plants in my house, but don't know where to start. Or now I should say didn't know where to start. So, my rating is based on the writing, what I learned, and how I feel -- not so much if the information is correct because on that I have no idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writing is super easy to read. It isn't dry at all and the illustrations of the plants helped make the book seem light and easy to get through -- because it was. I wasn't planning on reading it all in one sitting, but I did because it is easy to follow and the way it is written makes the content matter feel so doable.\n",
      "Which leads me into how I feel and what I learned. While I learned there is way more to taking care of a plant than watering it, I think it is something I can do -- with the right plants. I didn't realize house plants would need re-potting or even that you could grow tomatoes indoors (what?!). I learned where I could start, where certain plants will do best in a house, basics on plant care, and what plants I could look forward to getting once I can keep some alive. There is also a huge list of plants in the index, so I can look them up online -- which I am totally going to be doing. After reading this book, I feel semi-prepared to go out and buy a plant because now I know what to expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, this isn't going to be the book everyone should read. It is definitely geared towards beginners and feels more like a stepping stone to getting someone excited about houseplants and getting them to research more about plants. This is general knowledge with focus on which types of plants to put in each room and why.\n",
      "\n",
      "My one little thing is I wish there was a section of resources for further information. It would have been a cool addition, but it isn't needed. The acknowledgements are full of places with websites, so I'll probably check those out in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you're looking into getting houseplants or wanting to expand your small collection, I do recommend you read this book!\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is a cute little book for beginning plant owners that walks you through the needs of various types of houseplants and what plants are well suited for different areas of the house. It doesn't cover a lot of plants and there are no photos. There are fun black and white illustrations and some of the plants mentioned have drawings of them, but not all. I'm not really sure how useful any plant book can be without illustrations but it does have some good basic info and has a fun, conversational writing style.\n",

      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "When I saw this book on Netgalley I knew I needed to read the ARC. Never Put a Cactus in the Bathroom is a good book for the novice plant person. Over quarantine, I've been slowly adding plants into my collection. Some of my plants have thrived (looking at you, mystery plant from Trader Joes) and others that didn't (looking at you, spider plant from Trader Joes). This book was a great basic plant book for those wanting to know what plants will survive where. The book reads like a textbook so I recommend having it solely as a reference book and not read it cover to cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, this was a solid book that I would recommend for someone who is extremely new and doesn't know what plants to buy for what room.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I was drawn to this book for the fun title! I love houseplants and am always looking to up my game, so I was hoping to learn a lot about fine tuning my plant care. And while I did learn a few things, this is definitely a book for beginners. I consider myself an intermediate plant owner so the majority of this content wasn't new to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked how the author went room by room through a home and gave tips for how each plant could thrive or decline there. I worked in a flower shop for a while and the biggest thing I learned there was that a plant will grow differently in different home and even different spots in the same home. It was nice to see this reiterated in such specific ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also liked the author's casual tone. Her writing is straight forward and easy to understand. I wish she had included photos of the plants she talks about.\n",

Ruby and Bee are both set up to be given a good backstory that I wanted to find out, but nothing is revealed in this installment, so it kind of seems like the only hook they provide. In short, I'm not sure what to think of all of this.\n",

      "Ruby Holmes is eager to escape her evil ex and her past as an investigative reporter by traveling around selling delicious baked goods from a food truck. She's partnered with an older woman, Bee, who does the baking and Ruby will handle the people aspect. Excited for her new venture and eager to open in Maine, Ruby can't sleep a wink her first night. While walking on the beach that night, she meets local dude Owen Pelletier who asks her on a date! Ruby doesn't really feel like dating anyone but what harm can meeting Owen just once do? Apparently a lot because Ruby arrives at the restaurant to find it closed and Owen dead. The police automatically suspect Ruby because she's a newcomer to town and shut down the food truck. Ruby is determined to clear her name and get back to business.\n",
      "\n",
      "This story is OK. It was a pretty typical cozy. The whodunit was a surprise. I didn't guess until the end, before Ruby. The writing is fairly pedestrian and I didn't feel connected to Ruby or Bee in any way. Owen is a super creep. It's a dark, moonlit night and he hits on a complete stranger by scaring her with a ghost story. EW! The revelations show that I have better instincts than Ruby. No wonder she has an evil ex. Ruby isn't all that clever either. She stumbles around confronting suspects trying to get answers and willingly goes off with strangers and murderers. So much for investigative reporter instincts. She's also a cat person and for some reason I don't connect to cat loving heroines. I'd rather have a dog. Bee is fun but a bit of a mystery. I suspect she may have ties to law enforcement or something similar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Detective Jones is \"the incarnation of every small town mean police officer cliché.\" That line from the novel sums him right up. He's stupid and lazy. He wants to suspect Ruby because he doesn't believe any of the townspeople could have committed murder because he's never investigated a murder before. It's easier to believe an outsider did it. There is another guest at the B&B but he's never questioned. No one else is a suspect except Ruby. What the heck? Other local yokels include Grace, a waitress at the seafood restaurant where Ruby found Owen's body. She sure does love to gossip especially to complete strangers. Doesn't she have anything better to do? Miller, the cook at the restaurant, is a giant moron. He can't get his story straight but he goes straight to Ruby's suspect list because the one thing that's consistent is that he does not like Owen. I don't like Miller either but I don't think he's smart enough to be a murderer. Owen's Uncle Benjamin is the restaurant lobster supplier in town. Something happened to make him not want to sell lobster to the Lobster Shack. Could that be motivation for murder? There doesn't seem to be any family feeling there. Hannah, Owen's sister, is scary. She's big, loud, mean and temperamental. She goes ballistic on Ruby without having any facts to go on. Ruby thinks Hannah is scary enough to be a murderer. I say that's just so completely awful! As much as I WANT to murder my siblings sometimes, I'd never actually do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't care who killed Owen and I didn't care enough about Ruby to want to read more of these books. They're short and simple reads for a bit of light bedtime reading but not for me.\n",

The thing that I am not happy about is there is was a so much setup and then when and event happens it is a paragraph or a page at more. Except a cross over with another series I think the important part of this book could very easily have been incorporated into the another book, I personally thing the story should have been moved on a lot further then it was in this book.\n",

      "David Mack was already turning things up with the more adult Marvel Knights sub-brand version of Daredevil when he got Brian Michael Bendis to write Daredevil, Vol. 3: Wake Up; a book beautifully painted by Mack, but also the start of some seriously well written and multi-faceted Marvel 'street hero' stories. This first part of this volume is taken from Bugle reporter Ben Ulrich's point of view as he tries to determine what happened to a missing villain. (Trigger warning, the story involves violence against children). It's a sublime piece of work taking us the reader into Daredevil's world, but from the view of a civilian and it works really well!\n",
      "\n",
      "Five issues later, Bendis returned with artist to start what is generally agreed to be one of the greatest runs in the Marvel mainstream universe! sees a non-linear look at the fall of Kingpin and a contract kill out on Murdock! is a work of genius! Daredevil's true identity is made public and Bendis and Maleev drop a masterclass in tapping into the multiple eventualities such a story would bring, which left me on tenterhooks throughout!\n",
      "\n",
      "At least the third time of me reading this, and it just feels like it gets better and better. The cameos of the likes of Black Widow, Spidey, Elektra are pitch perfect as is the Ben Ulrich depiction (I will never forgive the TV show for killing him off!). The best thing about this run is how Bendis and co. attack, tear up and then fix the inconsistency of the series, and that they kick off with the biggie, that so many people know DD's real ID! Absa-lutley-glorious 8.5 out of 12 overall Four Star read :)\n",

Bendis makes it clear that this isn’t easy. It takes control and focus and Daredevil has poured both of those things into giving back to the rough neighborhood he grew up in by protecting its citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "And not just that. As Matt Murdock, the blind lawyer, Daredevil has to equate his vigilante side with his defender of the law side. It seems almost hypocritical so he has a damned fine line to walk.\n",

      "\n",
      "So here are the three main stories in this book:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In , Daredevil has to face the very real consequences of his actions. A little boy has been put into a catatonic state by the interaction between a criminal named Leapfrog who is the boy’s father and Daredevil. It’s not often that you see people caught in the middle between villains and heroes as the focus of a story and I really liked how nuanced this was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In , the Kingpin’s recent blindness has made him vulnerable to the other elements in his criminal “family” and things gets very dangerous for all involved. The best part of this story is the relationship between Kingpin and Daredevil. I’ve always seen Kingpin as a straightforward criminal boss: murderous, callous and completely evil. Underboss paints a more nuanced picture, particularly when it comes to the uneasy truce between Daredevil and Kingpin.\n",
      "\n",
      "And holy shit is Vanessa Fisk . That lady does not pull any punches and I was a little surprised at how much I was rooting for the wife of a crime boss.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And in my favorite story, , Daredevil’s identity is finally revealed to the world. The total media circus and how Daredevil and his partner Foggy handle it was just amazing. It was refreshing to see it handled in a way that seemed believable and not just some stupid stunt like having a shapeshifter show up as Daredevil next to Matt Murdock. Here you really get to see the conflict between Daredevil’s vigilante side and his lawyer side. And the case that they took on at the end…damn, that was crazy and way more emotional than I was expecting. Just an incredibly well done superhero story.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This may be my second Daredevil book of this month but it's exactly the tone of narrative and kinds of storyline that strongly appeal to me. Writer Brian Michael Bendis and I have an enjoyable relationship so far in comics. I often do get invested in his X-Men titles particularly the first twenty-nine issues of All-New X-Men and his entire The Uncanny X-Men run, as well as that groundbreaking piece House of M. I only read Frank Miller's work before this one so I don't have anything else to compare it to, but I can say that this first book of Bendis' run for Daredevil has astonishing potentials, rife with insightful characterization, believable dialogue and very atmospheric plots which are only enhanced by the four artists who gave life to each scene, all with their distinct visual styles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hailed to be \"one of the greatest creative tenures in Marvel history\" by IGN, Bendis' truly lived to that praise with its first volume comprised of issues #16-19 and #20-40. The first story arc was illustrated by David Mack whose artwork was really aesthetically elegant that I took a while looking through the pages as I read the narrative. It wasn't even a Daredevil story per se, but rather a Ben Urich-centric piece. As a dutiful and noble journalist, Urich begins to investigate a case which centers an abused and traumatized child whose father was a costumed crook known as Leap Frog. The exploration of Urich's psyche and heartfelt insights were highlighted by artist Mack's expressive illustrations which also depict the many layers of the grimy and tortured world of Hell's Kitchen and its maltreated youth through the ironic use of beautiful watercolors.\n",
      "\n",
      "This four-issued arc is exquisite in its stylish execution, and particularly stirring for its intimate portrayal of how crime and death affects an innocent soul. Thankfully, the boy in question, Timmy, wasn't corrupted even after that stunning revelation that unraveled the mystery of his father's death. Daredevil did appear right in the end to comfort the poor boy which was a great character moment for him, lending his vigilante persona the humanity it is often deprived of.\n",

      "\n",
      "The next story arc is a major one that happened to have a twofold development; one is a gritty crime drama concerning mobsters and the law while the other is the repercussions dealing with the exposure of Daredevil's real identity as the visually-impaired yet brilliant lawyer Matt Murdock. I expressed before in my previous Daredevil review that I was a fan of Netflix's characterization of Wilson Fisk, otherwise known as Kingpin, and although he made an appearance for this volume, he was sadly cast aside (murdered Caesar-style, even) by a gangster named Sammy Silke who fancied himself as Brutus or some ego-trip shit like that. Anyway, he's irrelevant as a character I can sympathize with, and aside from his role in Kingpin's demise, he also became privy with a secret concerning Daredevil's alter ego. When Fisk's widow Vanessa took it upon herself to avenge Kingpin, Silke got desperate enough to reach for the help of the FBI by offering them the information about Matt Murdock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What follows is a torturous process that made Matt question his life as a superhero and his calling for social justice. He gets into an exhausting argument with his long-time partner and best friend Foggy Nelson who tries to convince him to retire from being the Daredevil and just commit to their work as lawyers, as well as surprise visits from his ex-girlfriends Natasha Romanov (Black Widow) and Elektra which didn't really help him and their appearances only served as a painful reminder of his past failures. Now as much as Foggy disapproves of Matt's other life, he remains steadfast and dedicate to him as a fellow lawyer, citing that Matt is already a hero in his daily life as a litigator and so there really is no need for him to be the Daredevil in order to make a difference. He makes accurate observations that most of the losses and suffering Matt had undergone are also connected to his secret life and if he truly wants to move forward and be happy, he needs to give up that part of him that keeps him tethered to darkness and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now hounded by the media, Matt almost loses his shit over the scandal and lies that are beginning to pollute his personal life. Even though he has supporters from other costumed heroes and civilians (Ben Urich for one, and Peter Parker/Spider-man), Matt feels lost and misunderstood, especially with all his critics forming very harsh opinions about the cause he is fighting for and what he's supposed to represent for the city he lives, fights and would die for. One of the most memorable sequential art featured in this arc was that sequence drawn by artist Alex Maleev where Matt as Daredevil runs on top of the rooftops, angst-ing away, while key moments of conversations in his past pops up on the sides, serving as memory bubbles. One that struck me particularly was those that feature his late girlfriend Karen whose death he still blames himself for. Matt has clear unresolved issues and later on, he gets so upset that he almost exposes himself as Matt without his mask to a crowd of journalists. Luckily, Spider-man gets him out of there and snaps him out of his momentary lapse of stupidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was revealed eventually that a disgruntled employee of the FBI was the one who leaked the truth about Daredevil to several media outlet for some easy cash. I thought this was a great plot point because there was no grand conspiracy trying to bring Matt Murdock down from the shadows--rather, it was a desperate action committed by a man who opted to sell him out because of reasons of self-preservation as oppose to malice. Still, the damage is done and Matt had no choice but to put his reputation on the line by suing a media newsprint for libel. The lawsuit would have been quiet handled with an understanding between Matt and the head of the company but said head was so annoyed by how smug Matt was to think he is above the law, and for calling him and his newspaper liars. Basically, his journalistic integrity was wounded and he wanted to punish Matt for it. So the newspaper in question, The Daily Globe, maintains that what they reported was the truth, and Matt is just going to have to adjust to the reality that his private life has now been made public.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last arc for this volume was a pretty disheartening one, actually. It had something to do with the costumed hero White Tiger being put into trial for murder and theft because of a misunderstanding, a situation which was all kinds of stupid and leaning on the side of racial profiling, mind you. I was angered by how the story was resolved too, not because it was terribly written, oh no, but because of the powerful message it settled for. Bendis decided to give us an ending that provoked some righteous indignation from the readers because what happened to White Tiger was depressing and unfair and even Matt himself was powerless to stop it. Some good did come out of the dreary circumstances because the real culprit did step forward in the end, though, so that's enough consolation, I guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "n any case, this volume just made me so excited for the next installment! A rather brilliant, gritty and exciting exploration of the politics and repercussions of a life dedicated to crime and justice, Brian Michael Bendis' has proven itself to be an already a refreshing take on Matt Murdock as its titular figure with this tantalizing freshman volume.\n",

      "The son of a prominent mob boss in Chicago muscles his way into Hell’s Kitchen with a plan to unseat The Kingpin. Shortly after taking the reins, the new guy in town outs Matt Murdock to the world as Daredevil. On the heels of dealing with this PR disaster, Matt takes a case defending The White Panther, recently accused of murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last few years, I’ve become a big fan of the Man without Fear. I’ve made my way through Miller’s groundbreaking run in the 80s, Kevin Smith’s controversial Guardian Devil arc and have been up to date on Mark Waid’s current run. However, as of today, nothing has impressed me as much as the team of Brian Michael Bendis and Alex Maleev.\n",
      "\n",
      "The incredible artwork really puts this one on a level above the others. The first quarter in particular where Alex experiments with a free flowing layout coupled with varying styles blew my mind. Eventually the artwork settles down and falls into a consistent style that works well with the darker material presented. Alex paints some beautiful full page shots of Daredevil exploring Hell’s Kitchen at night, soaked to the bone from torrential rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great thing about this collection is that we’re presented with Matt Murdock just as much if not more than scenes with Daredevil taking down baddies. As much as I love getting great action sequences where Daredevil just obliterates his adversaries, the courtroom battles and the drama of Matt’s personal life can often be just as, if not more, interesting. The entire last story takes us into a New York City courtroom where forgotten crime fighter The White Panther is on trial for robbing an electronics store and subsequently murdering an on-scene police officer. Bendis turns the intensity up to eleven to the point where you’re never quite sure where the story is headed. He presents adequate arguments from both Matt and the DA where if you weren’t already aware of Panther’s innocence, you wouldn’t know which party to believe.\n",

      "The Dumbest Spy in the World\n",
      "\n",
      "Cummings, C. (2001). A Spy By Nature. New York: St. Martins\n",
      "\n",
      "The protagonist is a recent college graduate in London who works in a dead end telemarketing job and feels his life drifting. He applies for a job as a spy and apparently does well in the application, but is ultimately rejected without explanation. Or is he really? A retired MI5 acquaintance mysteriously invites him to join his international oil firm as a clerk, with a covert mission to spy on a competing American oil company. Young Alec accepts the job despite the lousy pay, long hours and probationary status, and sets about charming the socks off a couple of Americans in London who represent the American oil firm. He manages to establish a solid friendship, skillfully presenting himself as disgruntled, so that, predictably, the Americans turn him and soon he is passing information about the London oil company to them. All this takes at least 200 pages and is skillfully written. Then Alec acts stupidly, completely and unbelievably out of character, the dumbest spy in the world, and his cover is blown, his career ended. The end.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story is very plodding and predictable, with essentially no dramatic tension, because there is nothing significant at stake, and because there is no situational drama baked into the cake. What keeps the book from screaming boredom is good writing in thoughtful and keenly observed, if mundane, scenes.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I read this book after two of the author's other books. Had I read this one first, I wouldn't have read another. It's not often I get to the end of a book and want to scream, but this book has an ending that makes no sense to me. In addition, the main character is completely unlikeable.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "One of the worst endings since Russo's 'Empire Falls'. The protagonist is unlikable, inconsistent and quite frankly an egotistical pansy, if that combo can exist. There are a few moments of articulate insight into young career angst, but not enough to save this or sell it.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A Spy by Nature, Charles Cumming’s first novel, is the semi-autobiographical precursor several subsequent espionage stories that have caught the attention of reviewers and the reading public alike. The Trinity Six, the most recent, was a deft and ingenious reimagining of the familiar story of the five aristocratic Cambridge graduates whose greatest fame came when they defected to the Soviet Union after many years of undercover work in Britain.\n",
      "\n",
      "In A Spy by Nature, Cumming tells a version of his own story as a recruit to the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). His protagonist, Alec Milius, is a 24-year-old underperformer in London who devotes three months to testing and interviews preparatory to joining MI6, only to be rejected. The consolation prize is a job as a “support agent,” a species of contractor, who is placed in a British oil company with the assignment to infiltrate its American competitor and feed it disinformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Alec’s story unfolds, he finds himself more and more deeply enmeshed in a web of distrust and betrayal that brings out the worst in him — and generates tragic consequences. Cumming’s portrayal of his alter ego is utterly convincing, and the story brings to light an increasingly important aspect of latter-day espionage in the post-Cold War Era: industrial espionage.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Spy by Nature is an entirely worthy antecedent of Cumming’s later, more fully realized spy stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "(From )\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I worry that sometimes I'm reading a completely different book to the one that a lot of other people have reviewed...\n",
      "\n",
      "If this book is, as the cover promises, \"taughtly written, cleverly plotted\" then either the contents of my copy had been cunningly replaced by a windy, over-long and largely drama-free doppelganger or my understanding of \"taught\" and \"clever\" needs some serious work! Aside from the fact that the leading character is so unremittingly unlikeable that I ended up sincerely hoping the CIA would put him and his readers out of their misery (sadly the open ending denies us this wonderful reward), the basic premise of a spy story is that it will reward us with action, tension, or ideally both - A Spy by Nature signally fails on both counts..!\n",
      "\n",
      "Other reviewers have suggested that this is something of a \"poor relation\" to Mr Cumming's later books. This may indeed be so, but I for one won't be troubling to find out since something twice as good would still rate somewhere in the region of mildly disappointing.\n",

      "Yes. It's true. This piece of Christmas fluff has thawed my icy heart and left me a melted mess of joy and tenderness and good old Christmas Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, I don't even know how to explain why I got so much enjoyment out of the emotional rollercoaster this story took me on. reading this book, I'm certain of it. I was so thoroughly hooked that I didn't even have time to feel ashamed of myself for loving a romance novel so much. I just fully embraced the love. If that isn't Christmas spirit right there, I don't know what is.\n",
      "\n",
      "who is a single mother to 5yr old Jasper, who is the most important thing in her life. She's got no time for romance, but thankfully her job as a celebrity photographer keeps her busy and allows her to meet people to scratch the itch when she needs it. Then of course something unusual happens - a book ends up in her bike basket, and it's got a strange message scrawled inside. Lee sets about trying to solve this puzzle; meanwhile secrets from her past are drifting to the surface and her simple, controlled life begins to get a little out of hand ...\n",
      "\n",
      "I won't lie: I was mildly concerned when it started in a war zone, since I abhor reading war stories. However, beyond the prologue I found it added such a fascinating depth to the story through Lee's character, and I just really loved her journey from a war photojournalist to this celebrity photographer still trying to make a difference in the lives of others. I loved who it made her, but also her growth throughout the story as she began to deal with these things.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were a few different things going on but it never felt messy or out of control - rather, it added a fullness to the story that made it even more enticing to me. Like Lee, I got swept up in the lives of the people around her, and I loved all of them. I loved that Lee would help out almost incidentally - like it was just part of her DNA. But she's no martyr, either - she sticks up for herself, she doesn't hide or lie about her feelings (much) and she is determined to do things on her own terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The motherhood angle is another one I'm wary of because I can never relate but, again, I was completely sucked in by the relationship between Lee and her son. It's such a beautiful, meaningful part of the story, and I loved that he was always her number one concern no matter what else was happening. It struck me as much more real than some other stories I've read, where children tend to take a backseat to new love. Jasper was a huge part of this novel, and Lee's love for him is where this novel gets so much of its heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, it was also a lot of fun falling in love with pretty much all the men in this novel. I'm so glad that, as a reader, I don't have to choose - I can have them all! Sam is obviously the one who stole my heart the most, but I also just loved how supportive her friends were, and even the sincerity of the friendship between her and Harry (even though it's kind of messed up on the surface). They were all such real characters and even though they had their own moments of pain their places in this novel brought me so much joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mystery with the book was quite curious, but was just another layer to fatten up the story, rather than the sole driving storyline. I liked that. I appreciated that it wasn't laser-focused, and that Lee still went about living her life in the meantime.\n",
      "\n",
      "There really was a lot going on in this story but I was drawn in so thoroughly that it seemed to flow together pretty seamlessly to me. Some may find it a little long but I honestly couldn't get enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I am feeling so much Christmas cheer right now, thanks to this book. It's literally Christmas Eve, I've barely thought about Christmas once this year, and now suddenly I'm just overflowing with love and gratitude and I want to go hug my neighbours. (Obviously I won't, since 2020 is the year hugs were abolished.)\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I really enjoy Karen Swan’s books and I especially look forward to her Christmas offering each year. There is always a mix of romance and suspense and I can be assured of being taken away to a beautifully described location.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year’s novel Together by Christmas was a little different to Swan’s previously Christmas themed novels. The main character is Lee, a former war photojournalist who had been working extensively in Syria and winning awards for her photos. Lee is a little hard to like at first. She now photographs celebrities for publicity shoots and it’s very clear she doesn’t like these people or their lifestyles, but still she takes their money to pay the bills.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel this must have been a hard book for Swan to write as it covers some heavy topics. Swan explores themes of PTSD in journalists that have seen the horrors of war, domestic abuse, the exploitation of illegal immigrants and the pressure some parents put on their children to achieve their lost dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lee’s backstory is slowly revealed through her memories and also through sessions with her psychologist. As the story progressed I could see why she was so closed off, negative and insecure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Set in Amsterdam, I loved the atmosphere with the whole community out skating. There was a lighter side to the story with Dutch Christmas celebrations and traditions explained. These happy events blended well with the darker themes simmering below the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together by Christmas is a wonderfully immersive and important story. I just feel it may have been better not released as a Christmas read.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve given this 4 rather than 5 stars only because I want more joy from my Christmas reads.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Atmospheric, festive, and powerful!\n",
      "\n",
      "Together by Christmas is an absorbing, poignant, sensitive tale that takes you into the life of professional photographer Lee Fitch, a young, single mother whose main focus is on raising her son after years of shooting graphic photos in countries ravaged by atrocities and war has left her wounded by the nightmares and horrors she witnessed and endured there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writing is rich and emotive. The characters are troubled, scarred, supportive, endearing, and kind. And the plot is a bittersweet, at times heartwrenching tale of life, loss, love, family, friendship, perseverance, parenthood, guilt, courage, selflessness, war, new beginnings and the delightful history, culture, landscape, traditions, and unique holiday celebrations found in the Netherlands.\n",
      "\n",
      "As most of you know I am a huge fan of Karen Swan and have read almost every novel she has ever written, and Together by Christmas is without a doubt another compelling, romantic, emotional tale by Swan but one with perhaps a little more grit, depth, layers and hard-hitting themes than we’ve possibly ever read by her before.\n",

      "Ho amato molto questa storia che ti cattura dall'inizio fino alla fine, senza mai annoiarti, facendoti viaggiare su due binari paralleli, da un lato abbiamo una mamma che fa di tutto per far vivere al figlio tutta la gioia delle feste, mi ha fatto tanta tenerezza il loro rapporto, ma anche una donna che scopre l'amore, dall'altro lato vediamo questa stessa donna ancora persa nel suo passato, attraverso i suoi flashback, ne conosciamo tutto l'orrore... Ho amato la forza e l'audacia di Lee, l'amore per il suo lavoro, la sua coscienza sociale, l'amore per suo figlio, ma anche la sua fragilità di scoprirsi vulnerabile all'amore, la paura di lasciarsi andare ad esso...\n",

      "Ironically, shortly after starting Surrounded by Setbacks I was struck by a truck while bicycling home from work. My shoulder was fractured and dislocated; I've been out of work and pretty well defeated since. Even before that, I'd had a ridiculous five years of setbacks—including losing a wife, daughter, job, and more—which is why I requested this Goodread's giveaway book. It seemed appropriate for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure I have much to say about it. Everything anyone really needs to know about \"happiness psychology\" (what you might call this genre today) was written by the Stoics 2000 years ago. I read a lot of this stuff. Everything since then is either 1.) a repackaging of the ancient wisdom or a 2.) technical addendum to it, where some scientific study has shown some new data or revealed some unique insight that supplements what your grandmother's grandmother already knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "The repackaging type either dumbs down or softens the wisdom, or \"translates\" for a specific type of audience. , for example, translates into Bro-speak, for bros and other people that still get some kind of cheap thrill from naughty words. The second type of book is the one that builds a narration around modern psychological studies and has citations in footnotes no one reads—think your Kahnemans and Gladwells.\n",
      "\n",
      "seems like the dumbing down variation or a plain-speak translation. There are no citations (at least in this advanced reader copy), no research.

That's fine—we need \"translations,\" because different people respond to different voices.\n",

      "This series is, apparently, based around the nearly-100-year-old DISC model of personality that reduces the great diversity of human traits to 4 facets. This author's only contribution seems to be randomly assigning colors to each of the four. Why one would do this is beyond me. The reason you use an acronym (like DISC) is so you can remember what the acronym stands for, where colors have no inherent meaning. I'm I a green? A red? Who knows? There's no reason for me to remember which color randomly associates with what personality type.\n",
      "\n",
      "(I lie. I'm a blue. I pay attention to my reading. But the point is adding colors doesn't contribute anything. Colors already have metaphorical pre-conceived associations that get in the way. The Yellow personality here is NOT cowardly. The Blue is NOT sad.)\n",

      "The author lost me 1/3rd of the way through. In his personal \"list of setbacks\" in his life, he includes no less than four separate car wrecks; the wording implying the unlikely pattern was a function of his own reckless driving behavior and a function of a general thoughtless attitude toward the safety of others. This is a silly, unfair bias, a fiction I wrote in my head. The author could be the world's safest driver for all I know, and this is NOT a reason to dislike an author or book. I'm just sensitive to reckless driving these days. For some reason.\n",

      "This book was a great read. Erikson speaks some harsh truths about the way we handle problems and that adversities can actually be a good thing. They are part of our life, and we must learn how to deal with them to be successful. He gives examples from his personal life and specific examples for 4 different types of personalities, the so called “4-color behavior system”. It is not an exact science, but it makes complete sense. It is easy to identify yourself with one or more of them according to many factors such as manner, work style, priorities.\n",

      "The dynamic duo of Kel Carpenter and Aurelia Jane have written another fantastic book, Kissed by Chaos is the first book in the Magic Wars Her Immortal Monsters series and it was outstanding. While the story takes place in the same Magic Wars Demons of New Chicago, with familiar characters this series can be read separately.\n",

      "Coming from a powerful line of black witches does mean anything if they've abused you your entire life. Nathalie Le Fay learned to make her own path, becoming a far better person than anyone in her family. Not only is she a good person but she's powerful in her own right and has a terrific (if a little crazy) found family that excepts her for who she is. Nat is pretty badass, she may not have the most reliable magic but she's smart and has an eidetic memory. Nat remembers everything she has a memory palace with different aspects (manifestations) of herself keeping guard. It's a unique detail that I find incredibly fascinating.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three love interests so far. The Devil himself, Lucifer who at one point was a little crazy and a lot obsessed with Nat's best friend. He also might be a little dead and Nat may have had a little something to do with it. Lucy is currently haunting and is being pushy, arrogant, and a jerk but something is happening between them. Marcel is the witchy ex, whom Nat had a complicated past with and things turned very sour. He too is a jerk and makes the worse mistakes when it comes to relationships. Lastly, there's August, who is the gentleman incubus, who is a sex god and seems to have it together except for a cruel streak that comes out in intense situations. The guys are all stubborn and determined to win her over, let's just say there were some big speeches, the guys are really falling hard. However, after the cliffhanger at the end, I'm a bit nervous about how these relationships are gonna go.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a very witchy read, with spells and glamorous, magical artifacts and varying magical powers, teleportation, and portals, with backdrops like sex dungeons and opium bars, it was awesome. A lot was going on, cute kiddos who have more power than they should, a missing twin, relationship drama that hurt my heart, and a serial killer on the loose, not to mention the cats that Senorita Rosara has. The bonds are the most interesting things I've ever read, it's complicated and detailed like everything in this story. The complexity Kel and Aurelia have created in this universe really sells this story, seriously the world-building is excellent.\n",

      "I reveled in every single moment of Kissed by Chaos, the plot grabbed me and didn't let go while the characters with their complex personalities had my loyalty from the start. Not to mention the pop culture and little easter eggs Kel and Aurelia left. I can't wait for the rest of the series to be released but Kissed by Chaos does make me want to fill in the gaps by finally starting the Demons of New Chicago series.\n",

      "Kissed by chaos indeed, Nathalie or Nat as she is known has had a difficult history, with her family,  with her magic, with love.  But even she didn't anticipate tethering the devil to her or how he would make her feel. She couldn't have forseen meeting August and the sizzling chemistry between them. And to cap it all, her first love, Marcel, needs Nats help. This book has it all, unsolved murders, missing persons, fated mates, heat, spice, heart ache. Its absolutely glorious, I need book 2 right now !\n",

      "BRILLIANT… BLOODY FREAKING BRILLIANT!!! I have to remind myself every time I pick up a book by Kel Carpenter to not underestimate her writing. I never intend to but I’m always pleasant pleased that it exceeds everything I thought it could have been when I do read it! This dynamic duo have extended more in the world of new Chicago and it DID NOT DISAPPOINT! The plot line was exquisite and the world building was astronomical. The details this book contains are outstanding and leave me absolutely baffled that two people write something so perfectly seem less. This is truest one of my all time favorite reads for this year. I was unsure what book I’d be giving out as my Christmas book exchange but this… this is it! The characters are fantastic and our main character was a breath of fresh air in terms of personality and viewpoint. More often then not we see leads that are either full of themselves or they are meek, Nat proves to teeter perfectly among the too while still growing as a character. The male interests have left me intrigued beyond measure obviously I’m rooting for Lucifer but just for a moment I routed for the others as well. I appreciate that this is the be a book of many potential love interests but I also appreciate the almost slow burn of it. This book proved to be in part romance but ultimately I read it as a book of epic magic, adventure and plot with a spicy dash of romance in it. Many times I feel the romance overshadows the books themselves but not in this case. For this book I feel like it’s the deciduous frosting added to the cake and I plan to eat said cake over and over! Absolutely amazing, I could not recommend it enough!\n",

It’s full of feeling and the push and pull of bonds and oaths. I loved see old characters especially Pipper and the twins. I loved the new character’s just as much and can’t wait to see where their story’s take us. The world building was spectacular with every detail bring the characters and places to life. I LOVED EVERY WORD!! Bring on book 2.\n",

For years prior to its death, the National Lampoon featured any number of deadpan articles which were essentially born dead, whether the result of a poor concept, inept writing, faulty comic timing, or just plain comedic bombing.

Lamp. and McSweeney's is that the latter seems to revel in its presentation of unfunny humour writing. took its criticisms to heart, and expired. acts like it achieved its intended goal.\n",

It isn't even to be - witty, yes, but funny, absolutely not. It is, simply, humour writing without the humour. It's been removed, as if by design.

Because “I Know What You Did Two Moons Ago” is a spoof on detective fiction inexplicably interbred with stereotypical Native American tomfoolery. Because “Unused Audio Commentary by Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky, Recorded Summer 2002, for DVD (Platinum Series Extended Edition), Part One” is an 18-page meandering tribute to writers Jeff Alexander and Tom Bissell's familiarity with Zinn and Chomsky the movie franchise – and nothing more. Because “Candle Party” is narrated by a person hosting a dull candle party, and “Reviews of my Daydreams” is an inside joke that only the writer really gets, and “It's Not Actually A Small World” is the same joke over and over and over and over and over again – that it's not actually a small world because people rarely meet up with specific people from their pasts.\n",

Because it truly is not funny. It's not really clever, either. Though you can tell that it tries very hard to be. It's essentially the “witty” guy at a party who is slyly relying upon a rehearsed “spontaneous” monologue, which would be devastated should it allow any verbal input from an outside observer - the guy you'd feel embarrassed for if only he weren't so goddamned smarmy, so goddamned about how clever he thinks he's being. This book is trying so hard to be hip, to be young and filled with verve, that it is a shameless poseur.

I did laugh at the bad baby names, but don't waste my time calling this literature, okay? Go back and read James Thurber, and be amazed, amazed, at the command of prose style the man has in his best work, and the amount of literary reading you have to have done to fully enjoy what he's offering.

Taking the impermanent, impulsive content of the fickle internet and turning it into bound and printed matter...you people are crazy. Content-wise, it's like if all the contacts in your smartphone were forced to be at the same party.

      "Never take no for an answer.\n",
      "Don't give up on yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "This whole memoir was fantastic. I didn't know a lot about James Prince other than the fact that he's an OG, top dog in the music and boxing industry - but I learned a lot about him and it was enlightening. Ironically, he reminds me a lot of my dad; wise words and so much heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found this whole book incredibly inspiring and true af. If you want respect you have to go out there and work for it, you have to earn it and you have to treat people with the same level of respect they treat you with. That's how you build good relationships. That's how you build a good business.\n",
      "\n",
      "James Prince had an incredibly good personal story as well; what a time - to grow up for so many years and be misled about your own father until one day you're like at a family function, in your teenage years. It's wild. There's so much importance behind knowing yourself and where you came from and the kind of stock you're made up of.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can tell that James Prince is a legendary wild card too. I don't know if I really believed the whole rhetoric etc.. is \"pastor\" code switching for because it sure sounds like it! I respect that he never took the constant attack from the DEA laying down. Sometimes even if it seems like something is too big to challenge, you still have to challenge it. Especially for the good of all people like you, doing what you're doing, from your area. It shows them that they don't have to take it. Which is critical and can mean life or death. Fight for your life and freedom by any means necessary. James Prince ain't Malcolm, but that's some Malcolm shit - and even Malcolm wasn't MALCOLM when he first started out.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all - this was a 5-star memoir by one of rap's legendary influencers and sponsors of the culture. I liked the intro by Drake - it was a nice touch and just set the tone for the young folks who may not have lived the struggles that James Prince has talked about but likes to act like they have.\n",

      "Living in Houston, you tend to hear a lot about the guys who really set the city on fire over the years. J Prince is without a doubt one of those guys they talk about even far beyond his prime. J puts a lot into perspective in this project, really diving into some of the social issues that plagued his community and still affecting our black communities today. I've never gotten the chance to meet him face to face but I have shared the same space as one of his heirs in Houston and you can tell he lives by every word he preaches. His sons' hustle is reflective of that as well. He's a genius in many ways and continues to pay it forward spiritually, mentally, physically and even sometimes emotionally. This book is living proof that he's been doing it \"for the culture\" as many seem to preach about nowadays. A true mastermind and businessman who got it \"out the mud\". Love reading bios like these because you dive into the reasons why everyone ever fell in love with people like J Prince and the Prince heirs. Houston's rap scene wouldn't be the same without J and he knows that and shows it in every word in this book. His expertise extends far beyond what this book covers, touching the lives and careers of some of the industry's most prominent names, such as Drake. Drake shows that gratitude every chance he gets. This work inspired me to read more works surrounding today's rappers and entertainers. Someday we'll meet on a literary note, but until then...keep the hustle alive King!\n",

      "I love romance as much as the next girl, but something about this just felt kinda lusty. All of the sweet moments (like when Pierre rescued Angelique from her step-father’s attic, and another moment towards the end) were ruined because the two couldn’t stop undressing the other in their minds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything I liked or that is potentially good about this book is overshadowed by the insta-lust that takes place between the two main characters. If all that had been turned down about 80 notches and replaced with sweetness and a little bit of pining, it would have been straight up my alley. But their physical desires for one another completely overwhelmed the believability of their true love for each other; love that isn’t motivated by looks.\n",

      "ORIGINAL REVIEW:\n",
      "I’ve probably mentioned this before, but I’ll read anything Jody Hedlund writes. She could write about rocks and I bet it would be an award winner. Cloud formations? In!\n",
      "\n",
      "But seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can’t go wrong with a book penned by her. Thus, let’s not be too shocked that I loved her latest, Captured by Love.\n",
      "\n",
      "What can I say? It’s fabulous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hedlund has the ability to draw you so quickly into the story, where you’re hooked after a few pages and you’re thinking about the story the whole time you’re not reading it. Usually I have to finish her books in one sitting, but I had to spread Captured by Love out over two days and having to do that nonsense known as “a job” really got in the way of my Michigan friends!\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you’ve meet Angelique and Pierre (and all the other characters of course!), you’ll understand exactly what I mean! These two remind me of so many things, whether it’s sacrificing to do what’s right, staying committed and fighting for what you love. They’re people I would know in real life. But sadly, they are indeed fictional. Whatevs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason #578 I love Jody’s books? She takes historical eras and pieces of history that might not be known by the masses and makes it come alive. As in I NEED to visit Mackinac Island stat! While the main characters are fiction in this tale, many of the events and other characters are not and it was so interesting reading about them. I’m so so soooooo looking forward to Jody’s next release because I know it’ll be just as fabulous as this one!\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, Jody is kicking off a blog tour starting July 7th for this release, where you’ll learn all kinds of fun info about the book and other awesome details. There will also be a chance to win a signed copy of Captured by Love at each stop. Woot! You can find all the details here and I’m excited to kick off the tour! So be sure to stop by on Monday!\n",
      "\n",
      "Please tell me you’ve read at least one of Jody’s book! If you have, what’s your favorite? If not, I hope you get the chance to soon!\n",

      "Oh Pierre.....he was my favorite character in this book. The struggle to do what he thought was right, even if it meant giving up what he desired was painful to read at times. I liked Angelique, but I struggled to understand her at times. Jean (though hardly in the book) was my least favorite character, but at least he did the right thing in the end.\n",

      "This is Book 17 in Red Phoenix’s story of the submission of Brie. This book is the continuation of Brie and Thane’s happily ever after. They welcome their baby girl Hope with Rytsar at their side. This book was filled with Angst, Mystery and most of all love. The flashbacks let you know what led up to situations that are occurring now. I do highly recommend reading the books in order, but it is possible to understand without doing so.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Thane & Brie's happily ever after is all Brie is feeling especially looking into their daughters Hope eyes. Of course Rystar is right there by their sides as they introduces him to his god-daughter Hope Antonio Davis. As he takes his first dance with Hope Brie tears up not thinking she can be any happier. As life ASSUME a normal well their normal pattern, they forget about Lilly Thane's sister plots and get wayyyyy too comfortable in everyday life. As always the threat that looms over Brie becomes apparent when an old debt comes to collect Brie & Hope and now the race is on before they are taken and never to be seen again. Will Thane lose the only 2 people that have stolen his heart? All because of his sister Lilly obsessed and hatred of his wife & baby.\n",

      "Let me start off by saying this...\n",
      "It is not just the love between Brie and Sir Thane Davis that knows no bounds! My love for not only that charming duo, but the entire cast of characters created in this alluring series is also boundless.\n",
      "Since picking up the first book in the series, I have been nothing short of mesmerized and consumed by this series, devouring each book within record time. I just can't get enough!\n",
      "\n",
      "With tens of thousands of romance novels available at the click of a button these days, a romance reader can easily find instant gratification in a wide array of romance genres, right? We see new releases daily. However; the number of authors that are able to write a series that spans 17 books is quite limited at best. Now, if you also consider the number of authors that produce 17 INCREDIBLY WELL WRITTEN books all within the same series and using the same cast of characters, you have a relatively minute pool of authors to choose from to say the least. This is why I completely admire the talent that Red Phoenix has as an author, and why I gobble up every romance calorie she bestows on us like it's the last chance before a 40 day fast!!! If you haven't read a Red Phoenix book, .\n",
      "\n",
      "The focus of book 17 is predominantly the upcoming birth of Brie and Sir's baby, so this book has a unique emotional appeal to it as we peek into the roles that Brie and Sir will share as new parents. I will give no other plot spoilers in this review, sorry... not sorry. LOL\n",
      "There is anticipation, and excitement on a whole new level in this tear-jerking, yet joyful novel. We see a side to Sir that we have yet to experience as impending fatherhood approaches and it is truly beautiful. The dominant walls crumble as the child that now rules his heart teaches Sir a few things about what it means to love another so deeply. I couldn't keep the tears at bay! As always, where Brie is concerned...Sir is the perfect dirty gentleman. Sigh....\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps even more surprising is the way this bundle of joy affects our favorite and lovable sadist, Rytsar. Oh Lord, que the waterworks!! There is so much of Rytsar in this particular book, which I was so thankful for. The relationship between Brie, Sir & Rytsar is so entwined and deeply rooted that at times, you almost forget that it isn't a marriage of three people. Their relationship just flows seamlessly together in a way that makes your heart ache with wonder. I'm pretty sure my heart was so full during all of their interactions, that I could hear actual leaks opening up to allow for the expansion! Due to circumstances beyond anyone's control (yes, there is some angst & suspense), we see just how far Rytsar is willing to go to ensure the safety of those he holds dear. It was such a critical moment for Rytsar! One he desperately deserved. I hope now that he has faced his demons and found some peace, that Anton Durov will find his HEA as others in the series have done.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with each of her previous books in this series, the author makes sure that we get the perfect reunion with all of the characters we've grown to love: Brie's parents, Sir's italian family, Master Anderson, Tono & Autumn, Candy, Boa, Lea, Mary, Faelan & Kylie, even honorable mentions of Ms. Clark, Baron, Captain, and interactions with Master Nosh of the STC, and the intriguing new dominant-Hunter. Each of these characters are intricately woven into the storyline and add to the events that take place in book 17, including the child's birth and protection of Brie from unwanted attention. Tono Nasaka still holds a special place in my heart. Such an honorable man with a beautiful genuine soul. The things he does in this book! Gah......\n",
      "\n",
      "While this series is categorized as BDSM, or romance erotica- You will laugh continuously, you will cry tears of sorrow, joy and pain, you will want to jump your significant other the moment you see them, or dash out to the store to stock BOB up with plenty of fresh batteries!! It's just that good!!! There is no shortage of emotion, humor or intense 5 star heat!!! Each new book, begins precisely where the previous one leaves off so please read the series in order, but You will share an experience like you've never had before. One that will stay with you long after the final words on the last page. These characters take root in your heart and establish a home there. Even if you think you know what BDSM is, and think it's not your cup of tea..... She will dispel any beliefs you may have.\n",
      "\n",
      "* I am voluntarily leaving this review for the ARC that I received*\n",
      "Just like all of the other 16 books in the series, I will also be adding the audiobook version to my collection just as soon as it releases. I will stop whatever I'm listening to at that moment, and take the book 17 journey again (so not kidding). Like I said, I can't get enough! If you are an audiobook enthusiast, you are in for such a treat!\n",

      "Again there was a lot of backwards and forwards in this book and on occasion I felt a little lost but through it all I knew that finally Brie and Thane would have their baby.\n",
      "I loved getting insights into what has been happening to other characters and how they play a part in loving and supporting Brie and her family. It was great to see that Lea is finally happy, or is she? I am hoping that eventually Mary too will get her happily ever after.\n",
      "The connection and chemistry between Brie and Thane, knows no bounds, their love for one another shines throughout the book, with their scenes so hot that you can almost feel the flames as you read.\n",
      "The chemistry between Thane, Brie and Rystar is pivotal (not to mention, totally smoking hot) and we go into a lot more depth with this in Bound By Love. Thane and Brie’s love for one another and the friends is truly magical to read about.\n",
      "Lilly, well she is pure evil and unbeknownst to all she is still a major danger to Brie and the family she loves.\n",

I just love them all! This book has it all! Love, sex, suspense, endearing moments that brought tears to my eyes and so much more! I truly hope that this series never ends and we will be able to get glimpses into the lives of all of these characters forever!

      "I will say I did enjoy the characters in Murder By Chocolate (although not enough on their own to buy the next book). Ruby and Bee are both set up to be given a good backstory that I wanted to find out, but nothing is revealed in this installment, so it kind of seems like the only hook they provide. In short, I'm not sure what to think of all of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the mystery, it was pretty predictable and relied more on everyone cheating on each other than on any actual plot device. Most of this was easy to figure out from the beginning, and it seemed ridiculous to follow through with it. I did not get a lot out of the story in this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will say, this book makes me want to reread and continue with and 's Pink Cupcake series more than it actually makes me want to continue with this series. So I guess that isn't a great advertisement for the book as a whole. Overall, it was very mediocre.\n",

      "Ruby Holmes is eager to escape her evil ex and her past as an investigative reporter by traveling around selling delicious baked goods from a food truck. She's partnered with an older woman, Bee, who does the baking and Ruby will handle the people aspect. Excited for her new venture and eager to open in Maine, Ruby can't sleep a wink her first night. While walking on the beach that night, she meets local dude Owen Pelletier who asks her on a date! Ruby doesn't really feel like dating anyone but what harm can meeting Owen just once do? Apparently a lot because Ruby arrives at the restaurant to find it closed and Owen dead. The police automatically suspect Ruby because she's a newcomer to town and shut down the food truck. Ruby is determined to clear her name and get back to business.\n",
      "\n",
      "This story is OK. It was a pretty typical cozy. The whodunit was a surprise. I didn't guess until the end, before Ruby. The writing is fairly pedestrian and I didn't feel connected to Ruby or Bee in any way. Owen is a super creep. It's a dark, moonlit night and he hits on a complete stranger by scaring her with a ghost story. EW! The revelations show that I have better instincts than Ruby. No wonder she has an evil ex. Ruby isn't all that clever either. She stumbles around confronting suspects trying to get answers and willingly goes off with strangers and murderers. So much for investigative reporter instincts. She's also a cat person and for some reason I don't connect to cat loving heroines. I'd rather have a dog. Bee is fun but a bit of a mystery. I suspect she may have ties to law enforcement or something similar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Detective Jones is \"the incarnation of every small town mean police officer cliché.\" That line from the novel sums him right up. He's stupid and lazy. He wants to suspect Ruby because he doesn't believe any of the townspeople could have committed murder because he's never investigated a murder before. It's easier to believe an outsider did it. There is another guest at the B&B but he's never questioned. No one else is a suspect except Ruby. What the heck? Other local yokels include Grace, a waitress at the seafood restaurant where Ruby found Owen's body. She sure does love to gossip especially to complete strangers. Doesn't she have anything better to do? Miller, the cook at the restaurant, is a giant moron. He can't get his story straight but he goes straight to Ruby's suspect list because the one thing that's consistent is that he does not like Owen. I don't like Miller either but I don't think he's smart enough to be a murderer. Owen's Uncle Benjamin is the restaurant lobster supplier in town. Something happened to make him not want to sell lobster to the Lobster Shack. Could that be motivation for murder? There doesn't seem to be any family feeling there. Hannah, Owen's sister, is scary. She's big, loud, mean and temperamental. She goes ballistic on Ruby without having any facts to go on. Ruby thinks Hannah is scary enough to be a murderer. I say that's just so completely awful! As much as I WANT to murder my siblings sometimes, I'd never actually do it.\n",

      "I didn't care who killed Owen and I didn't care enough about Ruby to want to read more of these books. They're short and simple reads for a bit of light bedtime reading but not for me.\n",

      "A terrific overview of the Regency. It's very easy to see the past as old-fashioned (duh) and set in stone: this is a useful corrective that focuses on it as a time of groundbreaking change, with people struggling against crushing oppression in many directions (including the weight of the past). It moves pretty briskly, touching on art, literature, science, politics, war, colonialism, orientalism, industry, the environment. That's all to the good, I'm exhausted with brick-thick tomes, and I've highlighted plenty to follow up. Very useful section on attitudes to homosexuality (Jeremy Bentham is always a valuable corrective to ideas of the past as a wholly bigoted place, though I'm really not sure we give a shit what William Beckford had to say about anything).\n",
      "\n",
      "A smooth, fast read, pacy and interesting throughout.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "“I never loved nor pretended to love her—but a man is a man--& if a girl of eighteen comes prancing to you at all hours—there is but one way.” At least, there is but one way if you’re Lord Byron, and Claire Clairmont, the stepsister of Mary Shelley (née Godwin) writes you fan mail. Not quite the stuff of, “She walks in beauty like the night,” perhaps, but both lines were penned by the same man.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s unsurprising that the subtitle of Canadian academic Robert Morrison’s The Regency Years: During Which Jane Austen Writes, Napoleon Fights, Byron Makes Love, and Britain Becomes Modern emphasizes the Romantic poet’s seductive rather than his literary prowess. Whether Byron deserves the title of the first literary celebrity or not, his persona is equally as famous and influential as his art. There are few writers whose name—“Byronic”—can also be used as an adjective.\n",
      "\n",
      "The average American reader is likely most familiar with the Prince Regent (who gives the Regency its name) from Hugh Laurie’s iconic performance in Blackadder III, but according to Morrison, Laurie’s oafish parody is far too kind. The Regent’s womanizing and gastronomic excesses were much-parodied, but his greatest crime was his insensitivity to the oppression of the British people by their own government. One of the most notorious examples of this was Peterloo, which began as a peaceful demonstration in Manchester by radical leaders and ended with a massacre of the assembled civilians by British soldiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The contemporary conception of the Regency may conjure up images of witty heroes sporting quizzing glasses. But the stormy period was marked by the first and only assassination of a British Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval, described by Morrison as “anti-French, anti-Catholic, anti-slavery, and fiercely anti-reform.” The Prime Minister’s killer John Bellingham, when demanded to explain why he had done such a thing responded, “I have been denied the redress of my grievances by Government…I have been ill-treated.” Many would have agreed with the assassin’s sentiments if not his methods. The notorious Corn Laws kept the staple foods of the working classes—bread—artificially high. Less than fifteen percent of the adult male population could vote, thanks to property ownership requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite such rampant inequality, the Regency was a time of great national pride. After all, Britain did defeat Napoleon, and Morrison writes a memorable account of what is described as “the most famous ball in history.” Held by the Duchess of Richmond for Wellington and his men, it was interrupted by the news that Napoleon had advanced into Belgium. Many troops, unwilling to end the evening of “lively music, good food, and beautiful women,” chose to “march in silk stockings and dancing pumps” rather than leave and prepare for the battle to come. The Regency was also an era of rapid industrialization and colonization. Britain was determined to ensure goods from sugar to rum to tea and opium flowed back from the colonies to satisfy Regency Britain’s unquenchable appetites.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those appetites weren’t confined to food. Regency entertainments of dice, cards, horse racing, sport (including fox hunting and boxing), as well as the sport of the bedroom (venereal disease and prostitution were rampant), are all illuminated in exquisite detail. One anecdote involves a love token given by the infamous Lady Caroline Lamb to Lord Byron that shocked even the poet (hint—it was a lock of hair, but not from the lady’s head.). Another emblematic figure is the fiery, mercurial (and self-indulgent) actor Edmund Kean. His Shylock was praised by Jane Austen herself. “I cannot imagine better acting,” she wrote, although of another famous female tragedian, she sniffed, “I took two Pocket handkerchiefs, but had very little occasion for either.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Morrison’s work, The English Opium-Eater, was a finalist for the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. He is thus well-qualified to address the seedier aspects of Regency life. Even for readers who shy away from history books, fearing such dry texts will bring on the need for a cool compress and a glass of Madeira, The Regency Years is great, rollicking fun. And an important one, as many of these same social and political challenges still linger on in Britain—and its former colonies—today.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This concise history of the Regency years is a good introduction to the era, but it suffered a few setbacks in trying to cover as much as it could.\n",
      "There were sections that hit me as just a barrage of names, with barely a sentence or two to distinguish them, especially in the first chapter(Crime, Punishment and the Pursuit of Freedom) which concentrates on crime, law and order (or the lack thereof), civil unrest.\n",
      "The second chapter, (Theaters of Entertainment) also started with more names, names, names. Actors, actresses, theater owners, venues and so on. But, once the shift to novels occurred the pace slowed and the rest of chapter 2 was a delight.\n",
      "Chapter 3 (Sexual Pastimes, Pleasures and Perversities) was quite frank and serious--not written to titillate, but to inform. (I may never again be able to read a historical romance set in this era). This is where the author also touches on the various morality, chastity, clean living, sin no more groups and their efforts to tame the level of debauchery accepted in current society.\n",
      "Chapter 4 (Expanding Empire and Waging War), which starts with Waterloo, has the best concise recount of the War of 1812 that I have read. Of course, India and China receive a quick wrap-up, as does Raffles and the founding of Singapore.\n",
      "Chapter 5 (Changing Landscapes and Ominous Signs) is a very mixed bag--changes wrought by the proliferation of factories, the improvement in the roads, the advent of railroads and other scientific advances. Travelogues and guide books also get a mention. There's a nice bit on painters Constable and Turner.\n",
      "One note on the print edition. There are no (and I do mean NO) color illustrations. All of the embedded illustrations are black & white, or graytone: etchings, engravings, etc. This works well for all of the Cruikshank political cartoons and various pencil drawings. It is, of course, a total fail when the author is describing a Thomas Lawrence society portrait or a Turner 'landscape'.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all a worthwhile read, especially for all of the literature references and analysis. His bibliography and end notes are quite thorough and a good jumping off point for further digging.\n",
      "I have one or two nits to pick, but they're not worth mentioning here.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is an extensive, well-researched work. It included good and the bad of the era. No sugar coating. It opened my eyes to the debauchery that permeated the times. Fair warning for the chapter on the in-depth exploration of the sexual scandals and practices of the time. So much to learn about this time and it’s impact on our world today.\n",

      "David Mack was already turning things up with the more adult Marvel Knights sub-brand version of Daredevil when he got Brian Michael Bendis to write Daredevil, Vol. 3: Wake Up; a book beautifully painted by Mack, but also the start of some seriously well written and multi-faceted Marvel 'street hero' stories. This first part of this volume is taken from Bugle reporter Ben Ulrich's point of view as he tries to determine what happened to a missing villain. (Trigger warning, the story involves violence against children). It's a sublime piece of work taking us the reader into Daredevil's world, but from the view of a civilian and it works really well!\n",
      "\n",
      "Five issues later, Bendis returned with artist to start what is generally agreed to be one of the greatest runs in the Marvel mainstream universe! sees a non-linear look at the fall of Kingpin and a contract kill out on Murdock! is a work of genius! Daredevil's true identity is made public and Bendis and Maleev drop a masterclass in tapping into the multiple eventualities such a story would bring, which left me on tenterhooks throughout!\n",
      "\n",
      "At least the third time of me reading this, and it just feels like it gets better and better. The cameos of the likes of Black Widow, Spidey, Elektra are pitch perfect as is the Ben Ulrich depiction (I will never forgive the TV show for killing him off!). The best thing about this run is how Bendis and co. attack, tear up and then fix the inconsistency of the series, and that they kick off with the biggie, that so many people know DD's real ID! Absa-lutley-glorious 8.5 out of 12 overall Four Star read :)\n",

      "\n",

      "To be honest, before this book Daredevil just never seemed all that interesting to me. A blind dude with superpowers fighting crime? I mean, good for him but why should I give a shit?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bendis makes you give a shit about Daredevil.\n",
      "\n",
      "He’s not just some blind superhero, he’s a guy who has learned to control the fact that his hearing tells him what people blocks away are saying or the heartbeat in a person’s chest or the smell of food cooking across the street. Bendis makes it clear that this isn’t easy. It takes control and focus and Daredevil has poured both of those things into giving back to the rough neighborhood he grew up in by protecting its citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "And not just that. As Matt Murdock, the blind lawyer, Daredevil has to equate his vigilante side with his defender of the law side. It seems almost hypocritical so he has a damned fine line to walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the . Some of it was so damn gorgeous that I wanted to frame it and put it on my wall. Definitely one of the better artists I've seen on a superhero story in a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "So here are the three main stories in this book:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In , Daredevil has to face the very real consequences of his actions. A little boy has been put into a catatonic state by the interaction between a criminal named Leapfrog who is the boy’s father and Daredevil. It’s not often that you see people caught in the middle between villains and heroes as the focus of a story and I really liked how nuanced this was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In , the Kingpin’s recent blindness has made him vulnerable to the other elements in his criminal “family” and things gets very dangerous for all involved. The best part of this story is the relationship between Kingpin and Daredevil. I’ve always seen Kingpin as a straightforward criminal boss: murderous, callous and completely evil. Underboss paints a more nuanced picture, particularly when it comes to the uneasy truce between Daredevil and Kingpin.\n",
      "\n",
      "And holy shit is Vanessa Fisk . That lady does not pull any punches and I was a little surprised at how much I was rooting for the wife of a crime boss.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And in my favorite story, , Daredevil’s identity is finally revealed to the world. The total media circus and how Daredevil and his partner Foggy handle it was just amazing. It was refreshing to see it handled in a way that seemed believable and not just some stupid stunt like having a shapeshifter show up as Daredevil next to Matt Murdock. Here you really get to see the conflict between Daredevil’s vigilante side and his lawyer side. And the case that they took on at the end…damn, that was crazy and way more emotional than I was expecting. Just an incredibly well done superhero story.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This may be my second Daredevil book of this month but it's exactly the tone of narrative and kinds of storyline that strongly appeal to me. Writer Brian Michael Bendis and I have an enjoyable relationship so far in comics. I often do get invested in his X-Men titles particularly the first twenty-nine issues of All-New X-Men and his entire The Uncanny X-Men run, as well as that groundbreaking piece House of M. I only read Frank Miller's work before this one so I don't have anything else to compare it to, but I can say that this first book of Bendis' run for Daredevil has astonishing potentials, rife with insightful characterization, believable dialogue and very atmospheric plots which are only enhanced by the four artists who gave life to each scene, all with their distinct visual styles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hailed to be \"one of the greatest creative tenures in Marvel history\" by IGN, Bendis' truly lived to that praise with its first volume comprised of issues #16-19 and #20-40. The first story arc was illustrated by David Mack whose artwork was really aesthetically elegant that I took a while looking through the pages as I read the narrative. It wasn't even a Daredevil story per se, but rather a Ben Urich-centric piece. As a dutiful and noble journalist, Urich begins to investigate a case which centers an abused and traumatized child whose father was a costumed crook known as Leap Frog. The exploration of Urich's psyche and heartfelt insights were highlighted by artist Mack's expressive illustrations which also depict the many layers of the grimy and tortured world of Hell's Kitchen and its maltreated youth through the ironic use of beautiful watercolors.\n",
      "\n",
      "This four-issued arc is exquisite in its stylish execution, and particularly stirring for its intimate portrayal of how crime and death affects an innocent soul. Thankfully, the boy in question, Timmy, wasn't corrupted even after that stunning revelation that unraveled the mystery of his father's death. Daredevil did appear right in the end to comfort the poor boy which was a great character moment for him, lending his vigilante persona the humanity it is often deprived of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the pages that really spoke to me. Look at how gorgeous they are!\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The next story arc is a major one that happened to have a twofold development; one is a gritty crime drama concerning mobsters and the law while the other is the repercussions dealing with the exposure of Daredevil's real identity as the visually-impaired yet brilliant lawyer Matt Murdock. I expressed before in my previous Daredevil review that I was a fan of Netflix's characterization of Wilson Fisk, otherwise known as Kingpin, and although he made an appearance for this volume, he was sadly cast aside (murdered Caesar-style, even) by a gangster named Sammy Silke who fancied himself as Brutus or some ego-trip shit like that. Anyway, he's irrelevant as a character I can sympathize with, and aside from his role in Kingpin's demise, he also became privy with a secret concerning Daredevil's alter ego. When Fisk's widow Vanessa took it upon herself to avenge Kingpin, Silke got desperate enough to reach for the help of the FBI by offering them the information about Matt Murdock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What follows is a torturous process that made Matt question his life as a superhero and his calling for social justice. He gets into an exhausting argument with his long-time partner and best friend Foggy Nelson who tries to convince him to retire from being the Daredevil and just commit to their work as lawyers, as well as surprise visits from his ex-girlfriends Natasha Romanov (Black Widow) and Elektra which didn't really help him and their appearances only served as a painful reminder of his past failures. Now as much as Foggy disapproves of Matt's other life, he remains steadfast and dedicate to him as a fellow lawyer, citing that Matt is already a hero in his daily life as a litigator and so there really is no need for him to be the Daredevil in order to make a difference. He makes accurate observations that most of the losses and suffering Matt had undergone are also connected to his secret life and if he truly wants to move forward and be happy, he needs to give up that part of him that keeps him tethered to darkness and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now hounded by the media, Matt almost loses his shit over the scandal and lies that are beginning to pollute his personal life. Even though he has supporters from other costumed heroes and civilians (Ben Urich for one, and Peter Parker/Spider-man), Matt feels lost and misunderstood, especially with all his critics forming very harsh opinions about the cause he is fighting for and what he's supposed to represent for the city he lives, fights and would die for. One of the most memorable sequential art featured in this arc was that sequence drawn by artist Alex Maleev where Matt as Daredevil runs on top of the rooftops, angst-ing away, while key moments of conversations in his past pops up on the sides, serving as memory bubbles. One that struck me particularly was those that feature his late girlfriend Karen whose death he still blames himself for. Matt has clear unresolved issues and later on, he gets so upset that he almost exposes himself as Matt without his mask to a crowd of journalists. Luckily, Spider-man gets him out of there and snaps him out of his momentary lapse of stupidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was revealed eventually that a disgruntled employee of the FBI was the one who leaked the truth about Daredevil to several media outlet for some easy cash. I thought this was a great plot point because there was no grand conspiracy trying to bring Matt Murdock down from the shadows--rather, it was a desperate action committed by a man who opted to sell him out because of reasons of self-preservation as oppose to malice. Still, the damage is done and Matt had no choice but to put his reputation on the line by suing a media newsprint for libel. The lawsuit would have been quiet handled with an understanding between Matt and the head of the company but said head was so annoyed by how smug Matt was to think he is above the law, and for calling him and his newspaper liars. Basically, his journalistic integrity was wounded and he wanted to punish Matt for it. So the newspaper in question, The Daily Globe, maintains that what they reported was the truth, and Matt is just going to have to adjust to the reality that his private life has now been made public.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last arc for this volume was a pretty disheartening one, actually. It had something to do with the costumed hero White Tiger being put into trial for murder and theft because of a misunderstanding, a situation which was all kinds of stupid and leaning on the side of racial profiling, mind you. I was angered by how the story was resolved too, not because it was terribly written, oh no, but because of the powerful message it settled for. Bendis decided to give us an ending that provoked some righteous indignation from the readers because what happened to White Tiger was depressing and unfair and even Matt himself was powerless to stop it. Some good did come out of the dreary circumstances because the real culprit did step forward in the end, though, so that's enough consolation, I guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "n any case, this volume just made me so excited for the next installment! A rather brilliant, gritty and exciting exploration of the politics and repercussions of a life dedicated to crime and justice, Brian Michael Bendis' has proven itself to be an already a refreshing take on Matt Murdock as its titular figure with this tantalizing freshman volume.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The son of a prominent mob boss in Chicago muscles his way into Hell’s Kitchen with a plan to unseat The Kingpin. Shortly after taking the reins, the new guy in town outs Matt Murdock to the world as Daredevil. On the heels of dealing with this PR disaster, Matt takes a case defending The White Panther, recently accused of murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last few years, I’ve become a big fan of the Man without Fear. I’ve made my way through Miller’s groundbreaking run in the 80s, Kevin Smith’s controversial Guardian Devil arc and have been up to date on Mark Waid’s current run. However, as of today, nothing has impressed me as much as the team of Brian Michael Bendis and Alex Maleev.\n",
      "\n",
      "The incredible artwork really puts this one on a level above the others. The first quarter in particular where Alex experiments with a free flowing layout coupled with varying styles blew my mind. Eventually the artwork settles down and falls into a consistent style that works well with the darker material presented. Alex paints some beautiful full page shots of Daredevil exploring Hell’s Kitchen at night, soaked to the bone from torrential rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great thing about this collection is that we’re presented with Matt Murdock just as much if not more than scenes with Daredevil taking down baddies. As much as I love getting great action sequences where Daredevil just obliterates his adversaries, the courtroom battles and the drama of Matt’s personal life can often be just as, if not more, interesting. The entire last story takes us into a New York City courtroom where forgotten crime fighter The White Panther is on trial for robbing an electronics store and subsequently murdering an on-scene police officer. Bendis turns the intensity up to eleven to the point where you’re never quite sure where the story is headed. He presents adequate arguments from both Matt and the DA where if you weren’t already aware of Panther’s innocence, you wouldn’t know which party to believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s so much happening in these pages that even at a staggering 400+ pages, I wasn’t ready for it to end. Luckily for me, I’ve got Volume two ready to go.\n",

      "Adorable and fun fated mates story. Delta (h) is in town dealing with her deceased father’s estate (and trying to manage her complicated feelings about it - which I thought was beautifully done as someone who recently lost a parent). Calder (H) is a local selkie who’s “saved” by her when she thinks he’s drowning and he recognizes her as his fated mate. Except he’s not sure if Delta knows about the paranormal world and he has to temper his pursuit of her. Written in first person, dual POV. No ow/om drama and h wasn’t a virgin, H might have been but no history given.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved Calder’a cinnamon roll and sweetheart energy and also that he had an uncertain edge to him as the youngest in his family that was often overlooked. Delta has more going on then Calder realizes and she’s set on leaving the area, but she’s also reluctantly drawn into Calder and his courtship. She’s intelligent and independent but also has regrets and lacks connection. These two were so sweet together and very steamy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calder’s family add some funny side characters with a small side of family dynamic. Delta has a great dog, Gigabyte, who’s quirky and sweet. But most of the book is just the two main characters falling in love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually the paranormal side comes out, along with why Delta is set on leaving. They work it all out fairly easily and settle in to their HFN/HEA. The epilogue is a short jump ahead and also has a lead in to the next book. I’m happy my GR friend, Elizabeth, led me to this series and the ones she enjoyed.\n",

      "This was a very fun, quick read about a small town in Georgia that is the home of many \"mythical\" creatures - among them, you guessed it, a few families of selkies. When Delta mistakenly tries to rescue Calder from drowning, he immediately recognizes his \"mate.\" Luckily for those of us who are not into alpha-holes, he follows his sister's advice and does not stalk her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He might come on a little strong, but he's super respectful, centers his courtship front and center on Delta's pleasure, and is just a decent guy. Also, we didn't realize it before starting this book, but a guy who's described with a body that \"has mass ... not only muscle, but also a layer of meat that softens his edges\" turned out to be just what we wanted to read.\n",

He also appeals to me because he works at a SCUBA diving shop and that is fantastic since I'm a diver.\n",

      "Wifed By The Mountain Man is book three in The Mountain Man series by Frankie Love. I’ve become totally addicted to this series. In each book I get more and more attached to these characters. In this book we have the third friend, Amelia, and her mountain man, Reed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amelia had been with the same boyfriend all through college, four long years, only to have him break up with her right after graduation, for a new girl that looks like a fashion model. It’s only been two weeks since the break up. Amelia and her friends have graduated and are now looking at piles of student loans, no home, no job, and no man. That’s when they all decided to answer the ad for mountain men looking for wives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reed grew up in the system. But later, when he started his own business and then sold it, he ended up with more money than he could use. So he used some of it to build himself a luxury cabin deep in the woods. Then he got the surprise of his life, a baby. It seems like his ex-girlfriend failed to let him know she was pregnant. Now, a social worker is standing on his front porch with his daughter, a daughter he never knew existed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For months Reed tried to take care of his baby girl, Hope, on his own. But then he had the big idea to sign up with a matchmaker to find him a wife. But Reed really only wants a mother for Hope. He wants to be able to come and go, hunt and fish and whatever else he wants to do, knowing that Hope is being taken care of. He is not the least bit interested in a wife for himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reed and Amelia start right out with a chemistry that could melt the tires on the truck. Well, it almost does. But Amelia doesn’t know about the baby until they arrive home. And wow is she in for a big surprise when she sees Hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Reed doesn’t want a wife but Amelia wants to feel loved, and a sense of belonging. She feels like she deserves at least that. But the more time she spends with Hope, the more she falls in love with her. Could this be enough? Can Reed ever really love her?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Each book in this series is more and more addicting. I just love it. Reed and Amelia felt so real. As a mother, I could relate to every emotion Amelia was experiencing. But Amelia has to decide if loving little Hope will be enough to fulfill her. And Reed has to figure out just what he really wants. Does he truly just want a mother for little Hope? Or can he let down his guard, open his heart, and find love as well? We also get a wonderful little wrap up with the couples from the first two books that made this one all the more special. Now I can’t wait for the next book, Bucked, The Mountain Man’s Babies. I’m so glad I found this series.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is the third installment of the Mountain Men series, and not only do we get another hot and sexy read about a hunk in Alaska....but we get an epilogue that includes an update on all three couples when the book is finished. I am a sucker for a great epilogue, and this one was even better because I got to see how each couple was doing a year later!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am glad that I gave this author a chance, and I am intrigued enough to give some of her other short stories a go when I have the chance!!!\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Only one I managed to read in the main series. At least the guy knew he was an asshole and didn't think the heroine is winning the lottery in terms of his d*** and should be grateful and just start playing house and take care of his kid. Well, he still wanted that, yes. But he also at least knew it was wrong for him to ask that if her.\n",
      "And the heroine's struggle was real. Poor girl couldn't stay as just a mother of a kid and a convenient body to be used by her husband but she couldn't just up and leave the kid behind either, specially since the kid got attached to her pretty quickly and she genuinely fell in love with the kid.\n",
      "I hated the side character of the old woman who totally judged her for her reluctance to be a mother that soon. I felt like it was the author's direct opinion of modern females. She asked the heroine what she expected the life to be as a wife, and insinuated something very insulting like being a dolled up housewife. Whereas the true situation was that the heroine was tricked. Nobody told her about a baby. A matchmaker is supposed to disclose this information which she didn't, and NO ONE showed any repentance over that and it was never questioned or revisited. She doesn't have to want to be a mother straight after college specially of someone else's kid. If she knew about it and still wanted it that was different, but she was forced into this situation. How dare that woman suggest that she suck it up and move on as she should have known better? She was duped! She asked for a husband. Not a baby. She paid for a service that she didn't receive, no body cared about that, no body questioned the matchmaker, rather when she just showed a little fear she was not only judged but reprimanded? It was quite disgusting. I think this author is going to be a no go from now on too!\n",

      "==============\n",
      "For a mail order bride book, the concept was unique. I was up and down with my rating on this one, but in the end, it was the dialogue and Reed's complete personality switch that decided it for me.\n",
      "Reed put in his order with the agency for a mail order bride, but he wasn't exactly honest. He wasn't looking for a wife for him; he wanted a mother for his baby. Amelia is coming off a bad relationship and just wants someone to love her. Feeling like a glorified babysitter isn't exactly what she was hoping for even if he's hot as sin and throws sexy good times in with the deal. I liked Reed at first, simply because he was an ass but he owned it. My problems were with the discrepancies and the dialogue.\n",
      "First the discrepancies...He says that his baby mama skipped town without telling him she was pregnant but later tells Amelia that the mother told him she'd lost the baby. He says the agency knew about his requirement for his bride wanting to be a mother, but Amelia had no interest in it. Other little things like Amelia mentioning her sister and him asking later, \"you have a sister?\" It was annoying.\n",
      "The dialogue was the real mood killer for me though. Grown women, college educated women, saying \"for reals\" is a bit much. The sexy talk was sorely lacking as well--everything was \"hard and good.\" In fact, \"hard\" and/or \"good\" were used over fifty times, and last but certainly not least, he refers to her vag as a gap: \"filling her tight little gap.\" \"Gap\" is not sexy. It ranks up there with the words \"turgid,\" \"viscous\" and \"ooze,\" all of which just shouldn't be used in sex talk.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Wifed by the Mountain Man is the third installment in The Mountain Man series. In it, you will meet Amelia and Reed. Their first encounter was an interesting one if I'm being honest. Yeah, they didn't start off on the right foot but these two couldn't keep their hands off of one another. The smutty romance was hot from the start and I didn't want the flames to ever die.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, things were a secret for a few seconds. It didn't help that he hid a kid from her.. but it was also weird to throw her into the family mixture. Still not a huge fan of the whole mail ordered bride but this whole family was hilarious from the start. Especially when the whole bet came down to her watching the kid.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, they got an HEA and it was pretty cute. So cute that I even dove into the novella of this series. Let's see how this series is going to end.\n",

      "Okay, my 'laugh out loud' tag may seem a little extra here, but I did chuckle. There are a few good one liners here that added to the fun nature of the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me also clarify my rating here. I'm the kind of person who keeps buying succulents because I hear they are easy to grow, but I kill them. I want plants in my house, but don't know where to start. Or now I should say didn't know where to start. So, my rating is based on the writing, what I learned, and how I feel -- not so much if the information is correct because on that I have no idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writing is super easy to read. It isn't dry at all and the illustrations of the plants helped make the book seem light and easy to get through -- because it was. I wasn't planning on reading it all in one sitting, but I did because it is easy to follow and the way it is written makes the content matter feel so doable.\n",
      "Which leads me into how I feel and what I learned. While I learned there is way more to taking care of a plant than watering it, I think it is something I can do -- with the right plants. I didn't realize house plants would need re-potting or even that you could grow tomatoes indoors (what?!). I learned where I could start, where certain plants will do best in a house, basics on plant care, and what plants I could look forward to getting once I can keep some alive. There is also a huge list of plants in the index, so I can look them up online -- which I am totally going to be doing. After reading this book, I feel semi-prepared to go out and buy a plant because now I know what to expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, this isn't going to be the book everyone should read. It is definitely geared towards beginners and feels more like a stepping stone to getting someone excited about houseplants and getting them to research more about plants. This is general knowledge with focus on which types of plants to put in each room and why.\n",
      "\n",
      "My one little thing is I wish there was a section of resources for further information. It would have been a cool addition, but it isn't needed. The acknowledgements are full of places with websites, so I'll probably check those out in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you're looking into getting houseplants or wanting to expand your small collection, I do recommend you read this book!\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is a cute little book for beginning plant owners that walks you through the needs of various types of houseplants and what plants are well suited for different areas of the house. It doesn't cover a lot of plants and there are no photos. There are fun black and white illustrations and some of the plants mentioned have drawings of them, but not all. I'm not really sure how useful any plant book can be without illustrations but it does have some good basic info and has a fun, conversational writing style.\n",

      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "When I saw this book on Netgalley I knew I needed to read the ARC. Never Put a Cactus in the Bathroom is a good book for the novice plant person. Over quarantine, I've been slowly adding plants into my collection. Some of my plants have thrived (looking at you, mystery plant from Trader Joes) and others that didn't (looking at you, spider plant from Trader Joes). This book was a great basic plant book for those wanting to know what plants will survive where. The book reads like a textbook so I recommend having it solely as a reference book and not read it cover to cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, this was a solid book that I would recommend for someone who is extremely new and doesn't know what plants to buy for what room.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I was drawn to this book for the fun title! I love houseplants and am always looking to up my game, so I was hoping to learn a lot about fine tuning my plant care. And while I did learn a few things, this is definitely a book for beginners. I consider myself an intermediate plant owner so the majority of this content wasn't new to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked how the author went room by room through a home and gave tips for how each plant could thrive or decline there. I worked in a flower shop for a while and the biggest thing I learned there was that a plant will grow differently in different home and even different spots in the same home. It was nice to see this reiterated in such specific ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also liked the author's casual tone. Her writing is straight forward and easy to understand. I wish she had included photos of the plants she talks about.\n",

      "I will say this, I find enough appealing to the storyline that will lead me to book 3. My issues revolve around a few points.\n",
      "- Remus seems to be oblivious to whom he surrounds himself with; being the \"alpha\" he has the wool pulled over his eyes far far too much\n",
      "- Remus refuses to even consider the \"fated mate\" aspect; this is a big part of the world build; \"fated mates\" exist; it is hard to accept Remus would not even want to know if she exists\n",
      "- Luna has been rejected by her \"fated mate\" now she is willing to fall in love with Remus knowing full well his \"fated mate\" is out there; I mean ever heard of cruising for a bruising; just not a smart idea\n",
      "- Luna reunites with her family yet they still seem to me keeping something from her; they also warn her about Remus and the pack needing his \"fated mate\" and she's like .... I am a grown ass woman I can do what I want.... yeah, and your judge of character is so great? I mean you just spent 6 years with your fated mate who cheated on you the entire time and made naughty videos with all his women including you ...all unawares; so the family concern is warranted\n",

      "Luna wasn’t as bad, but still whiny in her mopey monologues she has. Our Alpha I like. He’s got all the good hero aspects. I just swish Luna would grow a backbone. I feel she needs to be more assertive ska Alpha to stand by our guy.\n",

      "A good filler between series.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I said for the first book of this series, I’ll say the same for this one . . . It was an ok book, but it wasn’t a great one. It wasn’t bad enough to not finish, but neither was it a “barn burner.” This book picks up where book 1 left off. Our FMC, Luna, has decided to help Remus find her pack alpha, and her fated mate, Marnet. He’s an asshole and she should have done this sooner, but I digress. He still manages to slip through their fingers and is on the loose. Remus and Luna travel to Remus’ pack-lands in Texas, where she doesn’t find a warm welcome either. Remus’ mother continues to harp on him about finding his mate. I guess even big bad alpha wolves aren’t immune from boundary-ignoring mothers asking “”\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest problem with this series, is the pacing of the storyline. I actually like the story, it just seems to take too long for it to unfold. Perhaps the author could benefit from a stronger editor to help reign in the pacing while still keeping the tension. Is it a fine line? Sure, but it can be done. From a reader’s POV, I loved reading about the pickle that Luna finds herself in. . . Her old pack, Lupus Paws, thinks she’s in cahoots with the alpha of the Silverstreak pack and is a spy for him, betraying their alpha, and her mate, Marnet. The Silverstreak pack, or at least some members of it, think she’s in cahoots with her old pack and will betray their alpha, and her new lover, Remus. A sticky wicket if ever there was one. As a woman, this kinda broke my heart. I could feel her emotions as she realizes that her fresh new start wasn’t going to be, and life in this new pack wasn’t going to be any different than life in her old pack. Call me a masochist, but I love a book that can turn me upside down and inside out (give A try if you’re a real glutton for punishment.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Some parts of the world building aren’t fully explained. Such as Remus’ mother’s singular desire to get her son married off. She states that the pack will be better off for it, but not exactly and it would be better. Another puzzling thing to me was Remus’ rejection of the idea of fated mates. I thought that was pretty much a staple in shifter stories, but our MMC doesn’t really believe in them. Strange for a pack alpha, don’t you think?\n",
      "\n",
      "Steam level is higher than book 1 of the series, but it’s definitely not a main thing either. Honestly, I was fine with this. I am still invested, so I will be reading the final book of the series.\n",

      "XXX! ADULT CONTENT, READER DISCRETION ADVISED. Luna was rejected very publicly by her fated mate. Her father was a bad man, er wolf. Whatever. His abusive mate was worse. Luna's siblings were abusive. Still she has a great outlook on life and keeps forgiving. Remus is a jerk to Luna at first. Then he sees her and all her worth. Then he can't let her go. Only no one wants them together. As Alpha, Remus is expected to find his fated mate. Luna is betrayed again by multiple people, even as she is rejecting Remus as they want. Remus is betrayed as well. By those he should have been able to trust the most.\n",

      "Review 1\n",
      "==============\n",
      "People tend to think of themselves as one thing. I am me. But right there, the idea that \"I\" am \"me\" connotes a certain division between a \"noticing\" part (I) and a thinking, feeling, behaving, relating part (me).\n",
      "\n",
      "Even a cursory inspection reveals that, on at least some level, the \"individual\" personality is made out of \"parts\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Somewhat metaphorically but also quite literally, these \"parts\" compete for dominance of our behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "I assume everyone has had the experience of feeing conflicted about an important decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "I assume everyone has had the experience of feeing like \"part of me wants to do (x), but another part of me wants to do (y).\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes it's as if you are an audience or a judge watching a little debate playing out in your own head. Part of you is arguing for doing it, and another part of you is just saying no!\n",
      "\n",
      "The observation that our (normal, healthy) psychology is made of parts (sub-personalities) is the fundamental assumption of Internal Family Systems (IFS), an approach to individual psychotherapy developed by Richard C. Schwartz, Ph.D.\n",
      "\n",
      "Working with the \"parts\" and getting them integrated and playing well together is the goal of IFS.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Self:\n",
      "\n",
      "IFS posits that all individuals have an Essential Self (referred to simply as The Self) which is described as a stable, equanimous locus of nonjudgmental observation and non reactive, flexible behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance:\n",
      "When part of you feels angry and wants to tell your boss to fuck off, and another part of you is scared to loose your job and just wants to say yes sir. This is an example of parts in conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you are ruminating over what to do, and you notice yourself having a little internal dialogue, The part of you that simply notices would be considered the \"Essential Self\" or simply the Self.\n",
      "\n",
      "Odds are pretty good that you aught to behave according to what that \"self\" guy says. Learning how to do that is what IFS is all about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Protectors:\n",
      "\n",
      "Protectors are parts that aim to shield the individual from painful or traumatic feelings and experiences .\n",
      "\n",
      "Exiles:\n",
      "\n",
      "Exiles are parts that are in pain, shame, fear, or trauma, usually from childhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roles:\n",
      "\n",
      "Different Parts play different roles and have distinctly different beliefs, feeling tones and agendas.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance:\n",
      "If you've been badly burned in relationships in the past. One part may be very sensitive and vigilant to signs of rejection. Another part may be highly protective of and want to defend the wounded part. Yet another part may be hungry for love and connection and may be more inclined to take risks. These parts can be in conflict or work in alliance with one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Extreme Roles:\n",
      "\n",
      "Protectors become active when an Exile is in pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Protectors take on \"Extreme Rolls\" in order to protect us from the extreme pain of Exiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "IFS focuses on parts in extreme roles because they are in need of transformation through therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "All In The Family:\n",
      "\n",
      "IFS observes that often times a persons system of inner parts has a similar feeling tone and functions in a way that is similar to the individual family of origin.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your family is anything like mine, this is some really fucking bad news. IFS is here to help us with this particular problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unblending:\n",
      "\n",
      "Unblending refers to the process of differentiating the part (Exile or Protector) from The Self, In order to (a) get to know the Part, and (b) heal the Part.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self Leadership:\n",
      "\n",
      "The essential task of IFS therapy is learning to \"stay in self\" i.e. learning not to dissociate into one of the Parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ultimate goal of IFS therapy is to unite the family of Parts under the leadership of the Self. In other words, to get all the sub-personalities on the same team and taking direction from the authentic, adult you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step by Step:\n",

      "IFS has developed a step by step protocol for disarming a Protector and healing an Exile\n",

      "If you would like to learn more about the IFS model, and exactly how to accomplish the work outlined above, than unfortunately you'll have to read the book.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Sitting On The Fence:\n",
      "\n",
      "Im not crazy about this book, and I'm ambivalent about he IFS model.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will say that I have been employing the model in my case conceptualizations and in my clinical work and it has been useful and insight provoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "But part of me (wah, waah) feels like the model is (a) dated and (b) too overwrought to be of much use to me as a clinician.\n",
      "\n",
      "My work will definitely be influenced by IFS, but I'm not exactly cueing up to drink the koolaid.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all likelihood I'll use parts (oh geez) of it and leave the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recognize the value of \"Parts Work\", but IFS is only one way of encountering and working with Parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "IFS is heavily influenced by earlier models such as Transactional Analysis, and frankly Part (it's getting old) of me prefers the vintage stuff (double pun, old, vintage...right?).\n",
      "\n",
      "Transactional Analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "Transactional analysis (TA) examines the interactions, or 'transactions', between a person and other people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The underlying precept is that people display different \"ego-states\" (that should ring a bell) that change in relation to others behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ego-States (Parts by another name):\n",
      "\n",
      "According to TA, there are three basic ego-states:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Parent:\n",
      "\n",
      "An ego-state in which people behave, feel, and think in response to an unconscious emulation of how their parents (or other parental figures) acted.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "When a person is castigating being judgmental of another, this may be the Parent ego-state in action.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Adult:\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"no drama\" equanimous, non judgmental, here and now oriented, rational, solution focused, stable core of the personality.\n",
      "\n",
      "While a person is in the Adult ego-state, he/she is directed towards a mater of fact, present moment oriented appraisal of reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Learning to strengthen the Adult is a goal of TA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Child:\n",
      "\n",
      "An ego-state in which people behave, feel, and think similarly to how they did in childhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "A person who is reprimanded by their boss (the Parent) may respond by becoming small, averting their gaze, looking at the floor and crying or pouting, as when scolded as a child.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't possibly do TA justice in this short from. But suffice it to say, it's a very simple, powerful model of interpersonal behavior analysis that deals with parts.\n",

      "The Future Of Parts Work:\n",
      "\n",
      "Evolutionary Psychology:\n",
      "\n",
      "Evolutionary Psychology (EP) asserts that we humans evolved various cognitive \"Modules\" i.e. distinct cognitive subroutines that serve different functions and activate under different circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cognitive Neuroscience:\n",
      "\n",
      "Cognitive Neuroscience (CN) asserts that our brain is modular, and our behavior and personality largely depend on which module is activated and which ones are \"off line\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Mindfulness:\n",
      "\n",
      "Mindfulness based psychotherapy is essentially focused on what IFS calls \"Self Leadership\" or what TA calls \"strengthening the Adult\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Mindfulness trains the equanimous, flexible prefrontal cortex to stay engaged when the freaky amygdala tries to \"hijack\" your behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Future Of Parts:\n",
      "\n",
      "When I do parts work, I'm more inclined to ground the ideas in findings of EP and CN and mindfulness, even though no psychotherapy model (that I'm aware of) explicitly integrates these ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's totally apparent that we must befriend and integrate our parts and strengthen the Adult and lead from the Self and all that.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I view TA and IFS as transitional pronto-modalities of a future model that really hits the nail on the head and grounds these ideas in the rational and findings of evolutionary biology and neuroscience and secular mindfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hopefully someone will create that model soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime TA and IFS are still pretty useful.\n",

      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The best book on individual psychotherapy that I've read so far. The model of Internal Family System is built on the theory of sub personalities and inner child, but with a more holistic approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "IFS proposes that a human being is not a single, whole and one entity, but there are different parts which constitute what we normally think as \"myself\". There are the healthy parts (which have positive qualities), the exiles (the parts that suffer from pain, shame, or fear), the protectors (the parts that protect the exiles, or protect us from the disruptive behaviors of the exiles), and the Self (a part which is similar to the Buddha Nature, which qualities such as calmness, compassion, curiosity, empathy). All of the parts are doing their best for myself, in their own ways, which may result in inner conflicts, or disturbing behaviors. IFS suggests staying in the Self to get to know the various parts, heal their wounds, help them to unburden and transform their roles in our psyche.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been a surprising and fruitful journey for me since I started practicing IFS. I got the chance to revisit the trauma in my childhood that I almost forget. I figure out these painful experiences still have a negative effect on my current life, and I am starting to metabolize these events from a more mature point of view. I reckon it may take a lot of work and time, but I hope I can be able to heal myself and my relationships with the people who are important in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm also looking for criticisms on IFS and different models that are developed from IFS.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This isn't a book you really finish as such, it's more like a user's manual to your psyche. So I've read through it once and done a few of the exercises, but I feel I've only just begun to appreciate its role in my inner life and I expect it's definitely a book I'll have nearby for many years to come. Best self-help book I've ever read. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I really appreciate the way this book broke down parts work and made the process of IFS very accessible. As a therapist, it was a little bit over-simplified for me but can see where all the examples and scenarios would be helpful for a layperson. I ended up scanning the second half of the book as it is already a lot of what I know, but still had some solid takeaways and would potentially suggest to clients.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "کتاب خیلی جالبیه؛ اولین کتابی که درباره صورت عملی به سلف تراپی یا «خود روان کاوی» خوندم. نظریه «وجود خانواده ای از اجزا در درون روان ما» و دسترسی به بخش های آسیب دیده و تعامل با اونها، به نظرم بنیاد منطقی و درستی داشت.\n",
      "کتاب رو کامل خوندم ولی چنین کتابی نیاز به ساعات متوالی سلف تراپی داره که باید برای خودم انجام بدم و اثربخشیش رو ببینم. کتاب راهنمای خوبی برای مراحل پیشروی داره، ساده و روان نوشته شده و پر از مثال های مختلفه.\n",
      "من نسخه انگلیسی رو خوندم که نسبت به سایر کتابهای روانشناسی متن ساده و قابل فهمی داره و از اصطلاحات سخت استفاده نکرده. این کتاب جلد دوم و سوم هم داره که به شرح مفصل تره اجزای روان یا پارت ها میپردازه و روش پیش بردن تراپی برای مشکلات متعدد مثل اهمالکاری، کمالگرایی مفرط، افسردگی و ... ارائه میده. هر چند جلد اول پایه اصلیه و وجهه عملی بیشتری داره و برای پیش بردن خود روانکاوی کافیه.\n",

The thing that I am not happy about is there is was a so much setup and then when and event happens it is a paragraph or a page at more. Except a cross over with another series I think the important part of this book could very easily have been incorporated into the another book, I personally thing the story should have been moved on a lot further then it was in this book.\n",

      "I penned this novel to be entertaining and thought-provoking, to remind us of the challenges faced by war, forced immigration, and assimilation into a new and sometimes unwelcoming country. Bycatch is a big story of human frailty, guilt, and forgiveness that starts during the Vietnam War and ends on the shrimp-rich waters of the Mississippi Sound. I hope you enjoy it.\n",

      "Rex Thomson is a tortured soul who can’t do what’s right no matter how hard he tries. While an airman stationed in Da Nang, in 1970, he steals money the U.S. government has earmarked for South Vietnam. Unknown to him, Captain Nguyen Duc Dung, a man of honor and principle, is blamed for the crime.\n",
      "This simple theft ripples through time with devastating impacts to all involved—including future generations. Twenty-four years later, this cast of characters from across the globe reunite in the shrimping industry in Biloxi, Mississippi—with cataclysmic consequences that destroys two families.\n",
      "\n",
      "A story woven with unique insight into individual motives and contrasting cultures, and told with rich and descriptive imagery, Bycatch is a riveting tale of transformation, a journey to forgiveness and redemption, that all who explore are sure to enjoy.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "From Christmas-like images in chapter one to an Easter celebration in its final paragraphs, Bycatch delivers characters, dialogue, and plot in scenes that reveal a crime and explore not only who but also why and how. So grateful I got an advance reader's copy! In his debut novel, Alexander Blevens time-travels with culture-crossed characters from the Vietnam War in 1968 to reveal two soldiers’ lives twenty-five years later, on the other side of the world, near the shrimp-rich waters along Mississippi’s Gulf Coast. Expressing voices from a huge cast to unravel the book’s complex plots, Blevens moves the reader through that time and space to examine the true nature of veterans Rex Thompson and Nguyen Dung and their families. Poor choices, grief, alcoholism, remorse, and reconciliation show the protagonist’s path in seeking his ultimate desire, to be a good man, a good father. Exceptionally well-written, this novel is a magnificent and worthy read.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A moving and suspenseful tale that explores clashing cultures, guilt, and forgiveness, Bycatch in an unforgettable and epic read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blevins paints haunting portrait of war and its ramifications in his outstanding debut. The vivid narrative spans decades with an expansive (but never overwhelming) cast of characters and intricate plot. Blevins research really shines through every page.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, this novel made me feel and made me think. Bycatch is an entertaining and haunting read that you should add to your summer reading list.\n",

All the while, I was sitting on the sidelines with my shades on, posted up with my arms folded, saying, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hot potato.\" That's not to say I didn't want to read this book, because I did. I even had an ARC sitting on my shelf for the longest time, but due to a lot of the hype, I kept putting it off. Plus, I'm one of those people who usually can easily figure out a plot twist and I didn't want to dive into something where a lot of people already mentioned figuring it out.\n",

      "\n",
      "1) Shifters in this book are infected by virus called Lyc-V (yup, same name) that changes their \"chemical makeup\" completely and gives them accelerated healing and regenerative abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2)Shifters are Pack and Pack in this book has the same Clan organization as Pack in KD series:\n",
      "There is a Clan Cat, Clan Wolf, Clan Feloidea (hyenas), Clan Muridea (rodents); Clan Canidea (foxes) and Clan Big (In KD series it's called Clan Heavy) which includes bears.\n",
      "\n",
      "3)Heroine is a mercenary. She is partnered with a guy named James who is a Pack and he is a Pack's Hunter (like he's Chief of Security or something..) and you know.. Like Lucas from Psy/Changeling series where Hunters are gifted trackers. :\\\n",
      "\n",
      "4)One of alphas of Clan Wolf is called Derek. Alpha of foxes is called Robert, same as Rat alpha in KD series. :\\\n",
      "\n",
      "5)Pack lives in Compound, a tall fortress, surrounded by fence on large piece of property outside of town. In Kate Daniels series it's called Keep and has same structure. (-_-)\n",
      "\n",
      "6)When main character goes to vampire lair- it's called Coven- she is met by the most beautiful woman she ever saw with waist long red hair whose name is Irina. Reminiscent to Rowena from KD of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "7)This world after Awakening (Shift) has also Psykers-humans born with psychokinetis powers. Like Psy in Nalini's series.\n",

      "Taking a wild guess that this is the book that made Ilona have to copyright some of her terms from Kate Daniels. This review should help you decide if it copies Kate Daniels (and Nalini Singh's Psy/Changeling series). There's also a character named Declan, (On the Edge, anyone?) as well as similarities to Singh's other series, which Angela has brought to light in her updates.\n",

      "Cursed by Fire is an awesome introduction to the Blood & Magic series…..\n",
      "A few years ago there was the ‘Awakening’ in which supernatural beings came out of the closet, Humans are no longer the top of the food chain. Everything about the world has changed including who holds the power and how they are governed; Vampires and Shifters are rivals for that power and always seem to be teetering on the edge of war with Humans stuck right in the middle….. what the supernaturals don’t know is that the Humans are evolving too and some come with their own abilities that just might be able to help them fight back.\n",
      "Aria Naveed is one such human, she uses her abilities to investigate crimes – a mercenary if you will. After a particularly bad case involving a child murder that weighs heavily on Aria, she is forced to reopen the case when some new information comes to light. With the reassignment comes a partner, none other than her friend and Shifter – James – and she finally feels they will be able to put this case to bed…… but what if it’s just the beginning? What if the childs death is part of a bigger issue? Can Aria find out before it becomes too late?\n",
      "If that’s not enough, Aria has a stalker, a strange man that evokes something in her each time they collide, he can do things Aria has never seen….. but can she trust him? Why is he following her?..... all will be revealed\n",
      "I thought Cursed by Fire was an awesome read and a great introduction to the series. Aria is a character that is very likable, she has lost everyone she cares about and only has a couple of people who she trusts and loves, she gives off a slightly lonely vibe but doesn’t let it get in the way of her work. I really liked her magical status (I don’t really want to spoil anything but the clue might be in the title) and how handy it is in dangerous situations but saying that, I thought she needed to master it more.\n",
      "The story was great and what started out as one thing totally turned into something else but that isn’t unusual for a UF and one of the reasons I love this genre so much. We are introduced to a much different world; with supernaturals being outed, the power dynamic has shifted greatly and the supernaturals have more power than humans, when you have a scenario like this you know what’s going to happen….the underdog is going to rise up and cause hell. We get the stirrings of war and meet all involved but no clear ‘good guy’ just yet because we are just getting to know everyone. I always like the investigative scenario that Aria finds herself in and it unravels some pretty interesting stuff as well as jaw dropping discoveries that come from nowhere. There is a smidge of romance and love triangle but it’s only a smidge and doesn’t detract from the story. I would say that I preferred one to the other and maybe routing for him but the other is more intriguing and I’d be happy to see either develop into something.\n",
      "I would say the book was very well written and had a Kate Daniels feel to it, which is so not a bad thing in my mind. With it being the first book, it is very much a getting to know you and the world you live in plot but it builds a very strong basis for the series to expand from and plenty of potential for where it could go. I can’t fault it in anyway and thoroughly enjoyed it and am looking forward to more.\n",

      "This book consisted of 3 stories of 3 brothers of their lives on how they managed to secure a bride.\n",
      "Honestly after reading the first story i felt like i was just going to be done there. Not that its not good but i know if i kept reading i would be digging a deeper hole and fall madly in loved w these characters. And guess what? Indeed i did! Omg their relationship is just so beautiful\n",

      "Mostly because there's no chemistry between characters. In each story, the bride got \"kidnapped\" and I was expecting more thick romance but in the end I only got the basic one and to me that's not enough. The plot itself is good, but the execution is a bit flat to me. And this works for all stories.\n",

      "Xander by Ruth Cardello\n",
      "\n",
      "Excitement is an understatement, drawn into a story of complete fantasy. I have been utterly engrossed into a story that many dream about, Xander is a prince very charming, handsome prince. He is 29 years old and must wed before his 30th birthday. He doesn't want to just settle for anyone crossing women off his list.\n",
      "He goes in search of Reanna, time is running out and his father the king will not be pleased if he fails. When he tries to date, Reanna, she refuses, clearly this is refreshing for him. Who says no to a prince but Reanna is unaware of his status she simply knows him as Xander. Reanna has not had an easy childhood. Losing her parents when she was so young and placed in foster care.\n",
      "She is very closed off from the world but you can tell she has a fighting spirit such an intelligent woman working in physics, facts and figures she understands, relationships she does not, she is innocent in every sense of the word. Xander needs her to go to his country, Rubare Collina, how can he achieved this without telling her the complete truth, he is taking a very big risk, deadly risk but he feels something for Reanna, she's special. He believes she will grow to love him given some time. Just when you think his plan has worked and love can conquer all, Reanna finds her fighting spirit. I held my breath from this point on. First I thought is she mad, crazy woman but some things in life are worth fighting for whether it's love, beliefs or protecting others. What a brilliant story. I was taken with this book. While Reanna was taken by a Trillionaire.\n",

      "Bryan by Author J.S.Scott\n",
      "\n",
      "In our wildest dreams would we all love to live out a fantasy as I have just read. We all grow up believing in fairy tales and that wishes can come true. For some dreams can come true for others we still love to dream.\n",
      "Bryan Demande is a prince, actually one of three princes. He is the middle child and doesn't really feel as special as his brothers but let me tell you the guy is so wrong. He is what I would call a STUD. OMG!! He is the man in my dreams at night. Isn't it funny how we get so drawn into a story, our minds can see the pictures playing out. This can only be a huge credit to the Author telling a brilliant story. Bryan has reached the age of 29 years and has been told he must marry as soon as possible. In Rubare Collina there are many laws but one that the king, Xander is fighting hard to eradicate is 'the marriage law', now I don't want to give the whole story away but in order to marry a prince has to comply with many traditions. Bryan does not want to marry anyone, he does not want a wife. He seen how miserable his mother was and does not want to live that kind of life. He does however think often about a woman he met called Shea when he attended college. Shea gave him a very precious gift, one night he will never forget.\n",
      "Shea finds herself in a strange country. Not knowing how or why she got there, but her main concern is where is Hayden. Who is Hayden? Well you need to read to find out. When, Bryan finds out about Hayden he is shocked to say the least, even more shocked than he is to see Shea after five long years. Shea is quite frankly in disbelief of the whole situation. As always nothing is ever as it seems, secrets hidden for many years are now revealed. Until the next time remember to hold on to your dreams because fairy tales really can come true.\n",

      "Christopher By Melody Anne\n",
      "\n",
      "Three is my new favourite number. This story is about the youngest prince in the Demande family, Christopher. There is only a year or two between each brother. They are very close. Their saying is 'brothers first'. Always protecting each other and of course poking fun when the opportunity arises. Christopher hasn't really cared about having a title as he likes his time always...living it large, drinking and bedding as many woman as possible.\n",
      "When he is told on his 29th birthday he must marry in order to keep that title, he can't believe his ears. No chance is he going to marry just to keep is royal title. He tells his family not a chance he is settling down.\n",
      "Months after his birthday he starts to have a rethink on what is important to him. He has met a woman in America called Adara who believes at first their encounter is a casual one perhaps Christopher too at the beginning but we all know how fast things can change. He really likes Adara, he wants her to meet his family but unfortunately she is having none of it. She tells him she no longer wants to see him. He is devastated but respects her wishes by leaving but not before he tells her its far from over.\n",
      "Oh boy 'Take 3' LOL. I wouldn't need to be kidnapped if a prince came into my life. Actually she doesn't know he's a prince but still the man is HOT!! They have an amazing time together so he can't see what her problem is, he believes that she does love him and just needs to realise that. And so it begins, poor woman thinks Christopher is insane and needs to be locked up. She is in for a series of surprises that's for sure and some not the good kind.\n",
      "Life can be as complicated as you make it but one thing is for certain if you love someone and are willing to do anything for their happiness, that's the person you need to be with.\n",

      "I'm a huge fan of all three of these authors but this book did not do it for me. By the time you make it to book three it's like reading the same thing for the third time. For me, it was hard to visualize what was going on. The princes came off over the top corny. I like the idea behind the stories but it was taken too far out there. Towards the end I just couldn't wait to be done reading it and considered not finishing. Erotic parts were all good and made me want a big nice bathtub to relax with my husband.\n",

      "This is a sweet alien romance about found families and adoption. I was hooked on Joanna’s story and couldn’t put it down. She is an older heroine and I liked that about her. She dedicated her life to her career and never expected to have kids, but she adopts Sultavi as her own and adores that little girl. Craxan spent his life going from one job to another and never expected to find his mate, but he knows instantly that Joanna is his. He’s protective, but also caring. He was considerate and sweet to Joanna and Sultavi. I couldn’t help, but fall in love with him.\n",

      "\n",
      "Joanna is a professor at a small and friendly college, resigned to a life without a family after her long term relationship ended. Single and childless she loves teaching, and her students, but is often lonely. When she is abducted by aliens, whilst trying to save one of her students, her life is turned on its head. She is sold as a slave to a wealthy alien Lord who wants a nanny for his young daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this part of the galaxy, women are scarce as there was a severe plague that killed massive portions of the population, most of which were women. Joanna’s owner was sick of his nanny’s getting married so decided to buy a slave instead. However, he didn’t mistreat her and seemed to see her as a valued employee who couldn’t leave or get paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "When there is a coup and Tavi’s father is killed, she runs with her charge, helped by loyal followers. Finally, she is rescued by Craxan a Cire mercenary and gets off-planet on a cargo ship by offering to work their way to somewhere safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with all the other books in this series I really loved the characters. I really liked that Joanna wasn’t in the first flush of youth. She is not slim and pretty, but round and ordinary looking. The way she looks after Tavi is so sweet and I really like that when she first arrived to look after Tavi she noticed her getting a bit spoiled and worked hard to put a stop to it. Tavi is sweet-natured and quite good at getting her own way, so everyone finds it hard to resist her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joanna is intelligent and interesting to read about. She is strong and compassionate and having Tavi has helped her stay that way. Craxan has had a hard life and lost everyone he has ever loved. He’s a strong warrior and longs to have someone worthwhile to protect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though this is a fated mates type story, it takes a little while in close quarters in unusual circumstances to get the romance going. I liked that it took some navigating.\n",

      "The supporting characters were all really well rounded and thought out carefully. They were engaging and entertaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the world-building was done in the previous books, but I still felt this book managed to convey the essence of the part of the galaxy that Joanna ended up in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plot was intriguing and entertaining with a few twists along the way. Though at its heart this is a romance, there is still enough plot to keep everyone engaged, even the most hard-hearted cynic.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very sweet romance, with some very tender moments, but it’s not sickly sweet. It’s also got plenty of passion and heat to counter-balance the sweet.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Zastanawia mnie fenomen tej serii. Mnóstwo osób poleca ją jako lekką odskocznię od cięższych książek, ale prawda jest taka, że ta powieść jest tragicznie zła pod każdym względem. Zamiast przy niej odpocząć i się pośmiać, można osiwieć z żenady i irytacji.\n",
      "\n",
      "Przede wszystkim, jest okropnie napisana. Każdy dialog wywoływał we mnie cringe i chęć wyskoczenia z okna. Od tych wszystkich ptaszyn, słonek i innych irytujących określeń, którymi bez końca zwracali się do siebie bohaterowie, robiło mi się słabo i musiałam tę książkę ciągle odkładać.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wydarzenia, które powinny stanowić główną oś historii, zostały opisane pobieżnie i nie wzbudziły we mnie żadnych emocji. Stanowiły wyłącznie tło dla kółka wzajemnej adoracji. W całej tej powieści podobał mi się tylko jeden wątek - biblijnej Izabeli. Ale to i tak tylko przez chwilę, bo autorka skutecznie spłyciła zarówno bohaterkę, jak i wszystkie związane z nią wydarzenia.\n",

      "Co mamy dalej? No właśnie, multum przesadnie wyidealizowanych postaci. Dora jest ucieleśnieniem ideału, w każdym względzie. Przyćmiewa wszystkich swoimi umiejętnościami dyplomatycznymi, zdolnościami magicznymi, pięknem i *tu wpiszcie cokolwiek*. A jeśli Dora czegoś nie potrafi/czegoś jej brakuje, możemy być pewni, że w następnym rozdziale posiądzie wszystkie pożądane cechy i umiejętności.

      "Suffice it to say that the tone-deafness is strong with this one.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Thank you to Netgalley and Mulholland books for providing me with a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.5 stars\n",
      "\n",
      "So I began reading this book, book 2 of the Rachel Knight series, immediately upon completion of the first. In some ways, this was a step down, but I did enjoy how Clark wove this mystery into the story. Unlike the other two I’ve read, this one does not have a simple resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the outset I should note that although these are part of a series, every single one can be read as a standalone. Clark doles out details from previous books that she thinks are helpful as needed, but she doesn’t spend too much time providing backstory. Since each case is its own case, much like a episode, you don’t have to have read one to understand the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problems I had with the first book, concerning filler obsessions with clothing (no, character, it was no so cold you had to break out your thermal underwear; stop trying to convince me otherwise, ugh), food, and alcohol, are more pronounced in this book, but that could be because I began reading it so immediately after the first. What also became more noticeable to me is that her two best friends don’t have much characterization. This is especially true with Bailey, with whom Rachel spends most of her time during the investigations. Bailey, I guess, is supposed to be stoic, but it just comes off as flat and wooden. The side characters and perps have more personality than she does.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing that really bothered me is that although this takes place about a year after the first book, there’s practically no progression in Rachel’s relationship with Graden. Let me put it to you this way - she is in her thirties. He is at least her age, if not older, yet they have done nothing but go on dates - for a year. They have not spent time in the other’s home, and they have not slept together either in the literal or figurative sense. That seems completely and utterly unrealistic to me. We aren’t talking about two young adults here - we are talking about adults living in a fairly progressive city who have been involved with others in the past, and you’re telling me they haven’t gone past first base? I’m not asking, or expecting, sex scenes in the book, and I get that she has commitment issues so she doesn’t want to “pick out china patterns,” but the notion that they’ve never been alone together in their own homes and been intimate is, to me, ridiculous at this stage in the game. It made her feel immature, and less modern than she’s written.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there’s the whole subplot involving Rachel’s sister and Rachel’s nuclear overreaction when someone brings up the subject after having learned of it by finding a news article during a Google search. That’s not an invasion of your privacy, Rachel. That person did nothing wrong. I get that you don’t want to talk about it, but don’t pretend like someone stuck a tail on you to find out all your secret and private habits. That story hasn’t been private since it made headline news. That entire subplot again made her seem immature and annoying, which sucks because I ordinarily really like her, even when she’s obsessing about it being cold and stealing other people’s food off their plates. -.-\n",

      "The investigation itself was, as always, pretty riveting, but sometimes got bogged down by amazing coincidences (not to mention the time taken to stop and eat, drink, and be merry). And once again, Clark doesn’t always voice her train of thought on a particular deductive thread, yet expects you to follow. She makes leaps and assumptions that are not obvious given what the characters know and she doesn’t always connect the dots in a way that flows, because she still has to link the conclusions back to other pieces of evidence, or at least explain away some of the questions that are raised when the characters make their conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rachel makes several poor decisions - both in her personal and professional life - that really detract from her character this time around, and it really highlights how much Rachel is allowed to get away with straying from a “by the book” investigation. One of those decisions, in an attempt to capture the perp, can only be deemed too stupid to live. It works, of course, because why not? But it was still such a facepalm moment for me that I couldn’t believe the same author who wrote wrote this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the three I have read so far (Books 1, 2, and 4), this is probably my least favorite. So much filler, a lot of deductive leaps that didn’t make sense and raised more questions than they answered, and some poor decisions by Rachel really made this one a step backward.\n",

      "Very disappointing read for me. I wanted to enjoy this book, but I CANNOT like a mystery that spends so much time on nonessential details, for example: What the protagonist and villain choose to wear in the morning, at what restaurants they eat and what they ate there, the favorite vodka (Russian double platinum - who cares?), the expensive watch that one of the villains wears, etc etc etc. GIVE ME A BREAK! This is also a travelogue of Los Angeles, a very self-involved city with many self-involved residents. If you like this sort of thing you will like the book.\n",

      "ADA Rachel Knight is back in author Marcia Clark's second novel in series with, \"Guilty By Degrees\". Also returning is is special DA. investigator, detective Bailey Keller, along with Rachel's sometime boyfriend Lt. Graden Hales. Rachel works in LA's Special Trial Unit, the ones that get the most exposure. However, an impatient Rachel jumps on an inept, and lazy ADA in court one day, and ends up picking up a case that's a real dud. The younger brother of a previously slain LAPD officer was murdered on a sidewalk with plenty of witnesses and cameras. But the case has no evidence of any sort. In order to solve this case Rachel and Bailey must go back in time to investigate the murder of LAPD's Zack Bayer. Bayer's wife Lilah was the one and only suspect in the murder. Lilah who was a lawyer herself, and had experience clerking for the DA's office beat the rap. The stunning Lilah turned on the charm and the jury bought it hook line and sinker. Now two years later Zack's younger brother Charlie is murdered in plain sight. Lilah is quickly targeted as the prime suspect. But Lilah is no typical suspect. She's a master manipulator and extremely brilliant. Rachel and Bailey end up investigating all over the city of LA. . Complete with shootouts, car chases, skinheads, and the creepiest of criminals this yarn does not lack for action. (Do LA's ADA's really run around with a .22 Baretta or .38 hand gun on their person daily ?) The plethora of characters who pop up along with each daily adventure are not the best of developed characters who are able to guide the plot to it's conclusion. At just over 530 pages, this tale just kept going and going. At times it seemed that the book was somewhat over written. An editor should have cut this down at least 100 pages. Although it read quickly it just meandered too slowly to a conclusion. After awhile I kept wondering if Bailey and Rachel had real jobs to report to and \"Work\" that needed attention. Hard to fathom an ADA running all over the city of LA. and not going to the office for days at a time. I realize Rachel as the protagonist had to be involved in the bulk of the action, but I just didn't buy it. It was an enjoyable story to read and I did give it three stars out of a possible five stars. However, I thought is was a sharp come down from author Marcia Clark's first Rachel book, \" Guilt By Association\"....... I'm hoping third book in series is a rebound. ( I will be reading shortly). Author Marcia Clark does seem to be a somewhat good story teller. But at times it was like, Marcia just spit it out already. Sometimes less is better. But give it a read and see if you agree with me.\n",

      "Rachel Knight has been successfully running from the ghosts of the past that haunt her every day. She is at the top of her legal game in the Los Angeles DA’s office, but still holds back when it comes to her personal life even with her best friends. When Rachel picks up a case that every other lawyer wanted to kick to the curb, the unexpected drawback is the tragic memories she kept under control would come back. Rachel has to take control of her emotions and her life. Right now, every ounce of her inner strength is being called up to keep her from jumping off the emotional deep end.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Rachel took on the case to find the murderer of a homeless man, her fellow lawyers in the DA’s office dismiss her. The timeline for results is short so she pulls in her friends on the police force and together they walk through what on the surface appears to be a random murder on the streets of Los Angeles but in reality is anything but that. Rachel digs deep to get answers and when they start popping even Rachel is shocked by the turn of events and the undercurrent that is pulling her toward terrifying results. The heartless crime that drove the start of all this him to this life is even more disturbing than anything Rachel has ever reviewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the tide turns completely against Rachel and every demon that has ever knocked on her subconscious comes barging through the door Rachel knows she will finish this case but at what cost. It no longer is a game to find out what happened to someone else as much as it is keeping herself out of the morgue and when evil is looking for you is there any place you can hide?\n",

      "Marcia Clark writes stories that are filled with mesmerizing details, characters you relate to, and an abundance of unbelievable plot diversity. Ms. Clark knows how to give the reader a proper balance of startling information added to take your breath away revelations.\n",

      "Having grown up at the very epicenter of Christian Hedonism I found Joe Rigney's book to be a very helpful corrective of the weaknesses and support of the strengths. For those reformed people who follow the teachings of John Piper, this book is the counter-balance you need. It strengthens the weak points and emphasizes the under-emphasized, specifically as it pertains to things like guilt about wealth and enjoying the basic pleasures of life. But it is not a critical or antagonistic work. Quite the opposite, actually. It is a work that takes teachings Rigney believes in and makes them more palatable and balanced. It is especially helpful for the young, vigorous reformed folks who may lack a level head and a wise mind. Ringer provides both with much joy, a dash of humor, and a clear pleasure in the life God has given.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I may never have gotten to this book, although it's the kind of book I love to read. The reason for that is that I thought I knew most of what would be in it already, and I thought I'd probably want to underline a lot of things as well, and I didn't want to take the time to do that (as I said, since I thought it wouldn't be ground-breaking for my thinking). And while it wasn't ground-breaking for my thinking, since I had heard most of it before, the book sparkles like a jewel—this really is the kind of topic that doesn't get old, at least not for me, especially having grown up in fundamentalism, where the focus was on spiritual things. The reason I finally got around to reading this book is that I had gotten a free audio copy, and I finally got Bluetooth set up in my car, so I could play it from my phone. Glad I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "One great thing about this book is that Rigney isn't afraid to compliment Doug Wilson (or Nate); no tip-toeing around, no qualifying this and that, no elitist scorn, no faux \"concern\"—just \"Thanks for your ministry\" and \"I've learned a lot.\" Recommended . Companion videos .\n",
      "\n",

Mas é, isto sim, uma tentativa de uma experiência redimida e redentora a enriquecer de sentido a existência, a nossa própria a de tudo que é conforme o Verbo, uma tentativa de experienciar todas as coisas . Nisso consiste uma piedade não afetada: levar cativa a Cristo toda nossa experiência.\n",

They should have been able to have dinner with her all the time, if they wanted. And the final big surprise, and ending... I didn't feel it.

      "It is a dangerous thing for a man to review a contemporary romance novel. Either I will be reduced to a gently weeping pile of mush (which I admit has happened on occasion), or the thoughts of the female star of the novel will make my eyes roll right out of my head (a painful endeavor at best). For the first half of this novel, I admit to being in the second category. I simply couldn't handle one more description of the hottest man God has ever made, etc. I also found the main character, Hannah, to be entirely self-absorbed. For example, she'd phone to unload her insecurities on her best friend, Scarlet, then seem to barely listen to her friend talking because she was so anxious to talk about herself. I just wasn't feeling the love.\n",
      "\n",
      "About halfway through the book, I gradually grew to care about Hannah and enjoyed the banter between Hannah and the oh-so-handsome Drew. I also found myself internally applauding as Hannah experienced some moments of growth, such as when she \"thought about that Scripture, the one about putting away childish things. Maybe that's all God required of me here - to put away my childish, petty feelings and live in the moment\". Thereafter, I thought Hannah would make a great friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't get me wrong. The book is meant to be light-hearted, and it certainly was that, featuring fun characters, and written with an expert hand. There are many humorous moments, and the end left me wanting to find out what happens next to the other lovable characters who grace the pages of the novel (such as Hannah's best friend Scarlet).\n",
      "\n",
      "So I'm left giving the book a mild recommendation of 3.5 stars out of 5. Female fans of contemporary romance novels will likely swoon with glee by the end of the story. I'm going to go read a thoroughly male suspense novel filled with scenes of testosterone and aggression.\n",

      "Hannah McDermott has a successful photography studio. She’ll soon be featured in Texas Bride magazine. And she has a celebrity client whose Galveston ceremony will be her ticket to the top spot on wedding coordinator Bella Neeley’s list of recommended photographers. But it could all come crashing down around her because of one man: archrival and photographer extraordinaire Drew Kincaid.\n",
      "As the competition between Hannah and Drew heats up, Hannah is surprised to find that it’s not the only thing getting more intense. She can’t get the handsome man out of her thoughts—or even out of her line of sight—and the job of her dreams is turning into a nightmare. Will everything she’s worked for slip out of her hands? And can she see past her pride to find a picture-perfect love?\n",

      "People who enjoyed getting to know Bella and DJ from the first series, then Brock and Erin from the second series, will be thrilled to see all of the characters again in this new series. I enjoyed a lot of the humor in this novel, and the Irish limericks in particular. There were a number of laugh out loud moments that I had to read to my husband because they were so cute. Once again the author has managed to take a sweet-themed romance and made it swoon-worthy and enjoyable to story for people who like edgier novels. I am never bored when I read any of the author's books. The characters seem very real so it's hard to remember they are fictional people.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked the message about assumptions and how so many things that \"Shutter Speed\" Hannah believed about Drew, Sierra and even her former nemesis Jacquie were not based on truth or factual information. It's a good life lesson to review in a book. I always love reading about characters who seem one way and then when you get to know them you discover they are not that way at all. You have to see the world from their point of view to truly know them. I was also amused by Hannah's mother breaking out of the status quo and redefining herself based on what she liked versus what her husband wanted. It was dealt with in a healthy way, so it worked for the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is sure to be another fun series. I am looking forward to reading the next book. I've read all three books in the first series, and all three in the second, so I'm up to speed and haven't missed any \"episodes\" with this wonderful cast of characters. Even people who haven't read any other books by the author will find this one easy to follow. They might not get the humor regarding \"Guido,\" but that easily can be rectified by reading the first series. Love that bird. :)\n",

      "Hannah McDermott has struggled with feelings of inadequacy all her life. She's always done \"pretty well,\" with first prize going to someone else. So, though her wedding photography business is expanding and thriving, she feels she's going to lose her edge when handsome Drew Kincaid opens a photography studio nearby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hannah is desperate to impress the premier wedding planner on Galveston Island, Texas, but it's not going to be an easy road to the top of Bella Neeley's list. Not when it seems that Drew is already a personal friend of Bella's. Hannah has been hired to shoot a major country music star's nuptials, but the woman is a total diva. Is this make-it-or-break-it wedding going to be worth the agony to Hannah? Or should she just let it go to her rival?\n",
      "\n",
      "It's hard to vie against someone who just wants to share tips and be your friend--or possibly more. Drew doesn't seem to have a competitive bone in his body, and it drives Hannah crazy. Before long, he's disrupted her life, won over her parents (no easy feat--she got her Irish competitiveness from somewhere!), and managed to haunt Hannah's nights and daylight hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the while, the diva's wedding date is marching closer and the demands are increasing. Will following through with her signed contract cost Hannah everything?\n",

      "Just once, she'd like to come in first. Not just with Bridezilla but, to her surprise, with Drew. But to reach into her future, she has to come to grips with her past and shake the curse of second-best once and for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're a fan of Janice Thompson's earlier books, you won't be disappointed in Picture Perfect, first in her new Weddings by Design series. Some characters from the Weddings by Bella series and Backstage Pass series grace this book, and I have my guesses as to where the current series will take us. However, if you haven't read the others stories, I don't think you'll be too lost.\n",

      "This novel will simultaneously make you smile and break your heart with its dark, distinctly Russian tragic humor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main character, Katya, and her family are Russian emigrees living in New York. Katya is a Professor of Creative Writing, and her mother is the author of Soviet children's math books. While Katya's relationships are falling apart, she doesn't see that her mother is dying of Stage IV ovarian cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mother leaves behind post-it notes containing fragments of a new math book she is planning to write for adults--not mathematicians but just everyday adults who need a reminder of the importance of mathematics in their lives. Lara Vapnyar incorporates these notes at the beginning of the chapters, connecting these pure mathematical concepts with the harsh realities faced by Katya.\n",
      "\n",
      "This novel is brilliantly written and packs a huge emotional punch. Yet why is this book so under the radar? I encourage everyone to check out this underappreciated gem from the hugely talented Lara Vapnyar.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Divide Me By Zero begins with an encounter between the narrator, Katya Geller, a 40-something mother of two, and a fish seller in Staten Island from whom Katya is buying caviar. “I was brought up in the Soviet Union, where caviar was considered a special food reserved for children and dying parents,” Katya says. The fish seller, another Soviet immigrant, understands Katya’s meaning and the two lock eyes and begin to cry. This moment of intense connection between two strangers charts the course for Lara Vapnyar’s frank and emotionally honest story of love and loss.\n",

      "You can read the rest of my review on BookBrowse, and you can read a piece I wrote on the Russian poet Joseph Brodsky .\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "So hard to describe this book, but I loved it. The narrator, Katya is with her dying mother - a writer of maths text books - telling the story of how she, and her mother and her husband Len, came from Russia to America. Katya has had 330 happy days with Len in a marriage of 17 years, she is in love with B. but having an affair with Victor. She tries to unravel all of this with the notes about maths on yellow cards that her mother was writing before she became ill. It's funny, and poignant, and heartbreaking about death and lost love.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I haven’t read a ton of novels by Russian immigrants, but all the ones I’ve read have blended melancholy and mordant wit. The characters all seem to look at life as something so absurd and sad that you can only try to laugh at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Katya, the main character, grows up in Moscow, but after the collapse of the USSR, she, her mother and new husband Len emigrate to New York. Katya has many acerbic observations about living in the last years of the Soviet state, the Russian immigrant experience, marriage and love (two very different things in her experience).\n",
      "\n",
      "The one thing Katya isn’t cynical about is her mother, Nina, whose life so differs from Katya’s. Nina and her husband were devoted to each other, while Katya marries and loves unwisely and unhappily. Nina was a brilliant mathematics textbook writer and remains determined to continue that pursuit even when she moves to a country where she doesn’t speak the language and has to settle for being a caregiver. While Nina puts her nose to the grindstone, Katya struggles to adjust to finding new work and meaning to her life. Nina lived for others, while Katya is mostly dissatisfied, thoughtless, and selfish.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know from the start of the book that Nina has died. Throughout chapters that begin with the text of a notecard written by Nina for an adult self-help math book, Katya tells the story of her near-obsessive relationship with her mother, her love life (extramarital and otherwise), and her relationship with her two children. That last relationship is the only one that is unalloyedly good, and the lively sweetness of her connection with her children allows us to see Katya’s nearly hidden tender side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vapnyar’s portrait of Katya is unsparing, which is impressive considering that it seems like it may be based on herself. What’s most impressive, though, is Vapnyar’s depiction of the heartbreaking last few months Katya has with her mother. I think most people who have been a parental caregiver will be able to relate to this.\n",

      "This wonderful book is about so many things: awkward childhoods, marriage, infidelity, the immigrant experience, mathematics, Russian literature, grief and depression. Mostly, it’s one of the most powerful books I’ve ever read about mothers and daughters. Vapynar perfectly captures how complicated the mother-daughter dynamic can be: the fierce love, the sometimes dysfunctional co-dependency, how daughters can alternately push mothers away and long for them to be close by, and how blindly unconditional each one’s love for the other can be. This book really resonated with me, leaving me a sobbing mess at the end. My favorite read so far this year, I think it came into my life at the perfect time.\n",

      "Enjoyable spin-off to the Drixonian Warriors series that isn’t dependent on you reading the Drix books. On the run trope that turns pretty quick from antagonistic to smuttylicious but I’m not mad at it. My only complaint is I wanted to know more - how is Karina his Linyx (and yes I keep thinking she’s his operating system?) and what’s the deal with her necklace? But all in all, I’m looking forward to the next one.\n",

      "I picked this up as a freebie and wasn’t sure what I’d get, but I was delighted, entertains, & enthralled. I did feel at the beginning I was missing something since the lead hero mention another alien race, but that feeling soon went away and I was sweeper up in the adventure and budding romance. It turns out this is a spin-off series but at the time I read this I didn’t know. You can read this series without reading the original it’s based off by this author. I liked both our leads. Each has their own trials and things to over come besides trying to stay alive. Strong heroine and sexy hawt alpha. Can’t wait to read on in the series and go back to the first series that started it all.\n",

      "This is another satisfying book set in Oxford by these authors. I don't know how a couple works together to produce a flawless harmonious story filled with complex characters and entertaining criminal investigations, but they certainly succeed. Oxford's art scene is the focus this time round, as well as drug use and other detours that include the invasion of Bridget's ex Ben and his team from London landing in Oxford to take over her homicide case. Central to the solution of crimes and misdemeanors included in this second episode is the history of Albrecht Dürer. The student who was shot whilst riding his bicycle was a disciple of Dürer and uttered a mysterious series of numbers with his dying breath. There was a great deal of dedicated police work by Bridget and her team in trying to determine the why and the who of of that initial murder. A very dramatic and hilarious reveal in London is just too good to miss, but I shall not spoil!\n",
      "This was such a great book I look forward to charging into the third book very soon. I like the nod to Morse (or Dexter) in making Bridget a lover of opera.\n",

      "\n",
      "The big problem I have is the characters and the pacing. Also, some clarity issues but they’re more of a writing flaw than an execution issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pacing considering reveals were predictable was exhausting. It felt very day-by-day which is a lot for a 170 page book. Add to that what feels like every chapter contains anew way in which she’s unique/special/powerful it felt like it was a lot of writing outlining how special she was which could have happened all at the beginning allowing for the actual story to develop. The “twist” or “cliffhanger” about her shifter side was a predictable event from the beginning especially when we keep being told how special she was. So the reveal was sort of flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok so our main girl. I liked her in the first couple chapters but she gets progressively more childish and whiny as things progress(it gets worse in the sequel). The guys are ok during this book but besides Niall they’re kind of middling. I’m going to complain about this more in my review of the sequel so I’ll leave it at that.\n",

      "This is a senior in high school aged girl finds out she has supernatural powers and that supernaturals are a thing and has to immediately depart for a school, leaving behind a loving family, so she can learn how to use her powers without accidentally hurting someone. She has more power then anyone else in the magic community. She is just learning about a complicated family past but herself has no previous trauma. She is sheltered and inexperienced.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least by the end of book 1 there is no mean girl at the new school trope, no teacher that has it in for her, and no clear bad guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do like that the author took time to world build and introduce characters. There is no insta love. There are a couple of characters you easily identify as future love connections, and there is an until draw to them, but five minutes after meeting they aren't the FMC's everything. If half stars were allowed I would bump my rating up a half star because this necessary part of a story is left out in so many of these type of books and it was nice to actually get it here.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, there are a number of areas that are underdeveloped leaving the story lacking. First, there is no major villain. There is the hint of a really abstract villian but there is no one to be weary of. You can tell the counsel is being set up to be a bad guy at some point but there isn't any threat right now. Because there is no bad guy there is no tension or climax. I was really left struggling to identify what the characters were overcoming in this book. I saw a review compare this to Harry Potter, so in that context, there is no Snape, no Dudley, no Malfoy and his pack, no Voldemort. You have Dobby, but everyone has to be nice. The most tension is maybe a Percy and a teacher who comes off more movie Dumbledore when Harry's name is put in the goblet of fire, but no frog lady. Book one in this series is basically as if Harry was running around with Ron and Hermione with Harry trying to figure out what a wizard is and having to take a pop quiz, and nothing else. Not a great story. More on the lack of obstacles to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "FMC either seriously under reacts or has an unrealistic reaction to the situation. Finds out supernaturals are real and she is one and she has to go to a new school, okay. Finds out a secret about her parents. Okay. Teenagers react more strongly when they discover you bought the wrong brand of peanut butter than the FMC reacts to world altering news.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cliffhanger at the end of book 1 isn't a cliffhange. You 100% know that is coming. If you hate cliffhangers that is good news, but if you are looking to sink a hook into readers and make sure they are there for the next book, it's another fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spoiler risk from here on. Read at your own risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, can we talk about the FMC's reactions. If you are going to write teens you have to write teens. She needs to have a big response to finding out she is adopted. There needs to be anger there. There needs to be you can't tell me I have to go to this school and leave my friends and little siblings because you aren't my parents you all are just people who lied to me my whole life. It's an excellent opportunity to throw in another example of her powers going awry and gives the opportunity for the FMC to break something with her powers and her aunt to swoop in and save the day in a way FMC can't rationalize away. Then you get the teen moving like a zombie, her entire world was just ripped out from under her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along the same line, FMC immediately takes up her parents cause. Oh they died? They must have been murdered. Why wasn't I murdered too? I have to get to the bottom of who did this. One, there was no ground work laid for the FMC to come to this conclusion. This revelation would have been a natural conclusion at the end of book one if FMC had encountered witches at the school who advocated the old ways of keeping to your own kind and someone had said something or FMC came across and article or something that mentioned who she suspected was her mom and dad that illuded to a group hating them. Then FMC brings up hey, do you think they could have been murdered? The author just was like hey wouldn't it be cool if the FMC's parents were murdered and just went with the concept of the FMC avenging their death without laying the groundwork. It's annoying. Just saying FMC you may be at risk because you are a mixed being when the whole point of the school is furthering mixing and there are other students just like her doesn't make sense. Immediately focusing on solving the deaths of two people you never knew when literally everything else in your life has just changed doesn't make any sense. As great as the story is at world building it totally skips developing the plot. It's a big miss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously, where was the struggle?\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it the test? A two hour exam or you have to be in a different class isn't really a climax. I mean, two hours across four subjects, that's only 30 minutes a subject, that isn't a lengthy test. That's a final exam for one class. Also, it makes zero sense that a week in they would suddenly decide to change her entire schedule and see if she managed to learn three years of material in two days. Obviously the school doesn't teach them much of anything those first three years if she could just skip them no biggie. This is a place where I feel like the story was a round peg shoved in a square hole so the author could just move on to the next thing without really writing the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was the struggle the very mild jealousy the guys display? I mean, they've known her a week and there isn't insta love here. The guys just want to dance with her. There was no actual drama. No fighting. No posturing. No reason for her to throw up her hands and abandon the party, considering swearing off all future parties. For all the times the FMC seriously under reacted this time she way over reacts.\n",

I also might have convinced myself that maybe book two isn't as bad as I remember and am tempted to buy that audiobook as well. (This is a bad decision in the making, I'm very well aware)\n",

The characters actually went to class and had interactions with teachers. The MFC was naive, but didn't come across as stupid. I enjoyed it and am looking forward to the next book.\n",

      "I love this series and the dynamic between Sunaya, Iannis, and Fenris. In this part of the story, Garrett arrives unexpectedly on orders from the minister to follow up on a rumor that after the prison fire and her consequent escape, Thorgana may be hiding out in the city ready to exact her revenge on Sunaya and Iannis and any other innocents who may get in her way. However, Garrett has an ulterior motive in mind that has to do with uncovering the truth about Fenris and possibly trying to lay the blame on Iannis so that he may be arrested for illegal magic and out of the running for next minister and therefore no competition to Garrett. At the same time, a human architect brings to the attention of Sunaya and Iannis that many of the buildings have been not properly followed protocol for earthquake and disaster prevention, at the forefront being the schools and hospital, and there is the probability of a major earthquake in the area in as little as two weeks. While Iannis assigns teams to prepare and strengthen the buildings and evacuate the schools and hospitals that are deemed too dangerous, Sunaya teams up with Garrett to investigate and hopefully locate Thorgana, allowing her to keep him off Fenris's case as much as possible.\n",

      "I finished this book in one day, less than 24 hours, as it was impossible to put down, as all of Jasmine Walt's books are. She is a very gifted writer with a talent for writing strong characters and worlds. Thank you so much to the author for putting her books on Kindle Unlimited. It is the #1 way to read unlimited books for only $10 a month and definitely worth it for an avid reader like myself!\n",

Garrett was a pain in the butt, but even he showed compassion in the end for his coworker. And I felt so sad for Fenris!!!\n",

      "This book picks up right where Tarnished ended. There is so much packed into this read. My mind was blown. There's new twists and players in the game you don't expect. Just when you think you know what's going on, you're thrown a curveball.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indiana is still having a rough time at school. Being ridiculed by almost everyone. She pushes back, but she can only do so much. Others start coming to her aid and she isn't sure if she should put her trust in them or not. Someone I thought was finally coming around to be who she needed showed me that might never happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "We get more of Brett's vile POV, along with Indiana's guys in this book. That was a huge plus to the story. I like all of her guys, but Maddox is still my favorite. Her foster brother Presley is a disgusting human and his sister Tinsley is sitting on that bench with him.\n",

      "I literally have no words. This book took me on a ride of epic proportions. After reading Tarnished, I was so ready to read Destroyed, ready to get back into it, knowing there’s so much more to this story. And oh man, this book did not disappoint. Indiana has become my idol. After being so timid, so triggered, she’s now ready to tell her story and I applaud her. There were some moments in the book where I was straight up cheering! Straighten up that spine, girl. You got this!\n",
      "\n",
      "This book features the POV of her disgusting brother Brett. And the sexy AF men in Indiana’s life. Maddox, the tattooed up best friend turned lover. Weston, the swimmer with alpha tendencies. Jagger the bad boy with a heart of gold. I have to say though, Jagger really stole my heart. I’m glad to see Jameson turning around. Well…slightly . Sort of. I didn’t think he was gonna actually be redeemable because there were times I wanted to throat punch him. I don’t know if it’s a temporary disfunction of his frontal cortex, does he have feelings for Indiana? I want more of his story.\n",

      "Thrilling romantic suspense\n",
      "\n",
      "Continuing from book 1, this edition follows Indiana's gradual growth of coping from her harrowing past and self-harm to blossoming relationships not only with a more understanding Maddox but also the guys who are set to become members of this polyamorous relationship. And the beauty in the development of the why-choose romance is the diverse backgrounds of the guys, from the most studious to the most dangerous. They crossed all barriers. And yet all of them, heroine and heroes, are realistically, wonderfully flawed. This story is romance marked by mystery, twists, and malevolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indiana is amicable, a warm personality, still damaged, fragile even, but given to bouts of strength on the way to recovery. I liked that this book focuses less on her past and more on her emotional growth, day-to-day events and encounters -- some toxic and some hilarious and a little steamy attraction to keep it interesting. An envious foster stepsister and toxic foster stepbrother are still on the rampage, along with some bullying and other harsh encounters in high school while side character Otis ruffling friend Jen and the other's feathers kept me laughing with his antics. Best friend, now boyfriend Maddox, and new love interests Weston, Jagger, and Jameson were oh so alpha and hot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Character development was excellent, whether the well-depicted differences among the guys or Indiana's closest friends, everyone was rendered perceptively unique and appealing, and with their own backstories that shaped who they were. Even the bad ones as foils to Indiana's crew contributed to the intrigue and suspense of the story, with blasts from the past and Mr. Anonymous at the top of the malignant list.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book's strongest suits were its mystery and the characters, their relationships. The budding attraction to the guys was tangible, and while the chemistry rang strong -- looks, electrical touches, sexual energy, the story was not particularly spicy. For me, that was a miss, particularly for a reverse harem. I would have loved more spice and less setting description, particularly, too, in favor of a faster pace, more story progression. Some settings were described in such detail to have been written as images in succession -- this and to the left, then to the right, behind, on the wall, etc. -- much more telling stylistically than showing. Overly descriptive. Also, the pace started moderately, slowed dramatically in the middle, and picked up right before the gripping cliffhanger. Overall, slow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Written only in the heroine’s, it was an engaging, heart-felt, romantic suspense. Low spice and rather slow. Still, I enjoyed Indiana, Maddox, Jagger, Weston, and Jameson, and I’m interested in how the story unfolds.\n",

      "Since his first lecherous touch I've had only one purpose. One reason to not fully give into my demons. The fraying hope of escaping this depraved life. Coming back to Montecito has reinforced what I was callously taught as a child. Everyone has something to hide...even those you hold closest. Depravity lurks in the shadows, taunting me, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. While anonymous threats promise nothing but bloodshed and death if I don't obey. My heart is torn between the three gorgeous guys who are the only bright lights in the obsidian darkness surrounding me. But if my soul claims each of them equally, will they forgive me for refusing to choose? When my nightmares begin to mix with reality, it's hard to know what's real and what's a figment of my fractured mind. One thing's for sure, if my monster's back, he will stop at nothing until I'm exactly how he loves me....Destroyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have to read Tarnished before you can dive into Destroyed. If you have not started this Dark Bully Romance Series yet, what are you waiting for? I loved that book so much and could not wait to have Destroyed in my hands to dive into it. It does not disappoint either. I need to mention to that some things in these books will be triggers for some people so heed the warnings in the beginnings of the books PLEASE!!! This is the story of Indiana who can never ever seem to catch a break. Her past keeps coming back to haunt her and some people just refuse to go and stay gone. I loved her so much. She really goes through it and good gosh you just want to steal her out of this book and show her a good world. Not the one she is living in. However she is the type of girl that doesn't need to learn her lessons the hard way and not grow from them. Then you have her fellar's. I just adored them so much. I do not have a clue how a girl could choose between one of them They all seem to complete and bring out little pieces if Indiana that no one else ever gets to see. I can not tell you about the story without giving something away and I refuse to do that. So just dive in and find a comfy place on the edge of said seat and enjoy the twist, turns and shocking moments. I for one can not wait to have the third book in my hands.\n",

      "Living the Farm Sanctuary Life: How to Eat Healthier, Live Longer, and Feel Better Every Day by Bringing Home the Happiest Place on Earth by Gene Baur is a wonderful book with lots of heartwarming photos! The book explains how the farms got started, introduced the reader to some of the residents, explains how a vegan diet helps the climate and earth, and the human body! The last half of the book has lots of delicious recipes! I was hunger when I got that far so they looked even better because each recipe had a photo too. I have been a vegetarian for over 15 years I don't miss \"meat\"! I have substitutes that I can eat that harms no one!\n",
      "I got this book from the library.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A very simple book that gently opens your eyes to the cognitive dissonance that I think every meat eater has. Despite the size it's a quick read with lots of great full colour pictures and a whole host of recipes.\n",

      "Yeah, that didn't scream VEGAN to me either. I was thinking more natural/organic/homesteading/REAL farming. If I had read the description in more detail however, I would have known but when I see FARM, I just don't think of vegan. What kind of farmers' don't eat eggs or use cow/goat milk? It's weird. I don't get it (unless you are allergic of course). Vegan diets are just not that healthy with all of the artificial substitutes that are used over natural products (yes, I said that). Anyway, story for another day.\n",
      "\n",
      "has a lot of beautiful pictures of the cutest, cuddliest animals, nice stories and tidbits. The more vegetarian meals and easily adaptable to non-vegan meals looked quite tasty and I will definitely be trying some as soon as the weather warms up.\n",

      "This is my 3rd Emerson read. Her first novel was overly fluffy. The second was better, but more speculation. In this one, I believe she tried to be more serious. More factual, but she almost tried too hard to prove her historical points. She found a way to write \"royal decree\" and \"Henry might behead you\" into every other page. I look at Emerson books as Historical Fiction for Beginners. That's not a bad thing, but for those of us who know the history, it can get repetitious and we can easily skim. If you are not familiar with this time period \"Royal Decree\" (couldn't help myself) is a great introduction to Henry VIII's final years and the Wyatt rebellion towards Mary. I will give Emerson her due. In this novel I felt she was more historically accurate. It's an easy read and a nice break when you simply want to read something light, but not far fetched story telling like many of the HF books available today. I like that Emerson writes about lessor known Ladies in Waiting, keeping the royalty in the background. This story covers Elizabeth Brooke's entry into Henry VIII's court via Lady Lisle (Jane Guildford). Her life intertwines with The Dudley's and eventually William Parr. She joins his sister's service and the ride begins between being on the wrong and right sides at court. I enjoyed this one.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "In 1542 a young noblewoman named Elizabeth Brooke (Bess) arrives at the court of King Henry VIII. Only 15 she is there along with a number of women, as possible choices to be the next Queen. Not having any interest in the decaying King - she tries to keep her head down. Before heading back home she does catch the interest of William Parr, brother to Catherine Parr. The moment they see each other it's love and so begins a dangerous and wonderful love story.\n",
      "\n",
      "By Royal Decree is a pretty amazing read. Intrigue and passion drive this story. I loved it. Rich in historic detail. Ms. Emerson's writing pulls you in from page one and makes you feel like your really there in the Tudor court. This is the third book in the Secrets of the Tudor Court, telling the story of Elisabeth Brooke and William Parr. I enjoyed Bess & Will's story. They went to through hell to be together and through all the pain and heartache they believed it was worth it. This is only the second time reading Kate Emerson, but she has become a favorite. If your a fan of Tudors, you won't want to miss this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book also includes maps, family trees and a Who's who of the Tudor Court. They were great tools to have while reading the book. As I said above this book is part of the series, but can definitely be read as a stand alone story.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I kept thinking Bess would have an affair with the king, the author played it like that. Saying how he thought she was pretty over and over again. Not that I wanted that, since she also said how disgusting Bess found him over and over again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh I am getting a head of myself. This is the story of Bess Brooke. A noble woman at the Tudor court. She fell in love with Will Parr, who was divorced, but not allowed to marry again. So through out the entire book she wants to be his wife. But we all know the history. That wont be easy during that time. Crowns change heads. Religion is under watchful eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hers was an interesting story. I of course googled what happened to her after the book ended too. ..ok I might have googled before the book ended. I just like to google! And then I had to google other people too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though I must say it got a bit long winded at the end. That is a problem with historical fiction since things happen that isn't always interesting. Still a good book.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Kate Emerson is clearly an expert on the Tudor period, and her descriptions of people, places, rooms, attire, and relationships are alone worth the price of admission. But add in characters who were really connected to the complex world of the English Court .. and this whole series is a \"must read.\"\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is the 3rd in the series Secrets of the Tudor Court, and so far my favorite. It tells the story of Bess Brooke, a real life woman who was sent to King Henry VIII's court. She captures the kings attention for a time, but since by then he was aging, bloated, and repulsive, he is greatly relieved when he chooses someone else for his wife, after the execution of Catherine Howard. She enjoys life at court though, after she becomes a lady in waiting. There she meets and falls in love with William Parr, but laws concerning marriage may keep them apart, unless they can get a royal decree from the king. William was divorced from his first wife, on the grounds of her adultery, but the laws then stated that a man could not remarry until his former wife died.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will and Bess strive to find happiness, while living through the turbulent times of King Henry's last years, and then the rule of his daughter Queen Mary.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really liked that the heroine of this story, unlike the previous two, wanted to marry for love, not for wealth or position. I also enjoyed reading about Henry's last wife, Kathryn Parr, someone I did not know a lot about; in most of the Tudor fiction I have read so far, she has only been mentioned briefly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was reading the biographies of the real people in the back of the book, and was saddened to learn that Bess died 7 years after the events in the book of breast cancer, only in her 30's; but I also noticed looking at the family trees in the beginning of the book, many people in those days did not live past their 40's or 50's. In fact, at one point in the book, Bess comments that her grandmother, in her 60's is the \"oldest person I know.\"\n",

      "What the hell did I just listen to? There are so many things about this book I need to explain that it is hard to know where to begin. I think the target audience for this book is either very young teen or old children. Another possible target audience is stoned adults? If you ever wondered what it would be like if a child was given the power of a God and then given absolutely no supervision ( or maybe the supervision of a mental patient) then this is the book for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story starts with a dragon's egg being stolen. The dragon the egg belonged to is pissed and goes out to destroy 18 human towns in retaliation. In the process the dragon comes across a family with a baby. The dragon roars and scares the hell of them, except the baby roars back. The baby is apparently a blue mage ( someone whose magic is focused on beasts, that can mimic or learn their powers/skills). The dragon decides to take the baby and raise it as a dragon (this dragon might be a little insane at this point). The dragon imprints the baby. Imprinting is sort of passing down the ancestral power. The dragon egg that was stolen would end up being just a beast without the imprinting. The imprinting allows for the person being imprinted to have access to all the magic energy from that line. So in this case, the young baby Vur, would be way more powerful than the hatched baby dragon that was stolen.\n",
      "\n",
      "About half the story takes place when Vur is around 5-6 years old and the other half takes place when he is about 16. It is impossible to describe this story because all the things that happen didn't seem to lead anywhere. There were people and plot lines that I thought would be important that didn't go anywhere. It was somewhat entertaining in the moment but the whole time I was wondering where the story was heading and it turns out the author didn't seem to know either. Think of it this way, if you ever have watched the old cartoon show Ren and Stimpy or for newer audiences Spongebob, you might have liked watching the show. Now imagine trying to write a review about that show and what happened during the show after it was over. Would anything you could write make any sense for someone who didn't actually watch the show? That is what this book was like. It was like watching 10 episodes of one of those cartoons. Everything was loosely connected but something that happened at one point of the story that you might want to know more about, turns out to be nothing. Some of the highlights of the things that I thought might be important but turned out to be nothing\n",

      "I didn't like that every character talked like either a teenager or a little child. Even the dragons who were thousands of years old. One of the dragons told another dragon that he was whipped. That vernacular seems a little out of place in this setting. It also didn't help that the narrator was a female that had a \"valley girl\" voice. I was almost expecting to hear a \"OMG\" or \"Whatever\" while I was listening.\n",

      "\n",
      "The only reason I deducted a star is I ran into one of my pet peeves within the first couple of paragraphs : the use of modern slang by a non-human in a different world. Some dragons are talking about another dragon and call him \"whipped\". If the author modified it to fit the setting, I would have been happier (e.g. \"tail whipped\"). There were a couple of other instances of something similar in the book but as I said, they're my personal pet peeves, so I think most people wouldn't care.\n",

      "This book first and foremost seeks to be fun. It is not a sprawling epic or a deep intricate narrative, but a romp where an overpowered child goes on a variety of adventures and antics, much to the delight and terror of the people he encounters. It is a hilarious tale where often times you will laugh out loud because of the sheer silliness or nonsense taking place. Additionally, the book also contains a few LitRPG aspects like talk of levels and classes, but the elements aren't overly stressed like in some other books. Altogether, the book just wants you to enjoy reading it and have a laugh as it never takes itself too seriously even in the darker moments.\n",

      "This book is nuts. It's absolutely nuts. I loved every second of the book. Grim is my spirit animal. I swear he is. This book is fantasy adventure on crack mixed with LSD, a sprinkle of coke to be downed by someone mixing a BFC Monster and 20oz Red Bull together. This is fun read and I'm DYING for the next book to come out.\n",

      "Ridiculous\n",
      "\n",
      "This book was definitely entertaining at times, especially since the protagonist is so overpowered, which I like. However, everything that happens in this book is over the top. I read 75% of the book and lost interest in finishing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like others stated, the litrpg aspect is kind of tacked on afterwards. Actually, if Virlyce would have left it out, the book would be more coherent. The litrpg aspect is refereed to about 10 times in the entire book, and then only vaguely. However, the scale doesn't make sense since a 5 year old that is level 1 I am assuming can destroy an entire group of level 100s? Like I said before, ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, all of the main characters are the bad guys, yet they are not treated that way. They casually murder and destroy entire towns and cities because they felt slighted or were bored. I usually like anti-heroes, but these characters are not that. Anti-heroes have a reason to do bad things: the greater good, revenge, to collect power, etc. The protagonists in this book do horrible things randomly for no reason. They are all sociopaths.\n",

      "I'm starting to doubt my ability to select good books. This one is just so... i don't know. The word escapes me. Silly? Immature? Maybe if I had been 16 I would have loved that book. In fact I probably would have loved Wendy's backstory (abandoned by her parents and cheated on by then boyfriend) and all those heavily emotional scenes and thoughts. Yes, my then hormone-filled teenage body and immature mind would have dug this book. My teenage self wouldn't have minded the fact that the heroine admits to having feelings for Max the day after meeting him, and would have ignored the lack of knowledge (on the author's part) and little comprehension of the real world. My teenage self would have related to the ups and downs and the emotions that are all over the place in this book. My teenage self would have overlooked the bad writing and poor dialogue, while it would have loved the Kissed by the Bay legend. My 30 yo self finds this all very... boring, lacking, unexciting, silly, simplistic, over-the-top emotional...\n",

      "I've said it before and I'm sure I'll say it again--I love a cute, first meet and this one is great! We first meet Wendy in Dash and Date, as a competitor on the reality dating show. She is a very no-nonsense, successful, high profile realtor and when her grandma dies, she goes home to fulfill the requirements of the will--to live with and help her brother run the inn for 30 days and then sell it, so that her brother can move on with his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy can't get over the fact that her parents abandoned her (and her brother), leaving her grandma to raise them. As soon as she could, she left home and never looked back, working hard to make a home for herself. I get all of that, but I wanted Wendy to wake up and realize how much she actually had. I firmly believe if you can't find a way to be content with what you have, you'll never be content and will always be searching for more. She has some towering walls up around her heart, as well. I think Wendy could've used a good therapist. Those moments aside, I really did like Wendy and her determination to work hard. She's a great, complex character.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a moment when her evil twin emerges, leaving her emotions on her sleeve, she meets Max. Of course, he sees her at her worst and still likes her, which is a good thing. Max is a saint--and a good-looking one to boot. I can't think of a more patient, accepting, and kind man than him. He is exactly what Wendy needs, but she may just push him too far--a person can only take so much of being pushed away.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have two favorite parts of the story. First of all, I loved the legend that is associated with this town and the inn. What an incredible setting for this legend to be a part of! I couldn't help but get very caught up in it and the romance that ensued because of it is just perfect. So perfect. I also loved the way Wendy really dug in and did her part to fulfill her duties. By doing so, she got to know herself very well, as well as her grandma. I love the lessons learned and the way things resolved and I'm definitely looking forward to more! Yay for a new series!\n",

      "I'm between a 3-4 star rating so I'm going with a 3.5. Cute story but the heroine was wishy washy enough for me that it caused me to disconnect from the story and focus on that vacillating and make me frustrated. That being said I did enjoy the whole of the book, especially the sweet romance. The legend of being kissed by the bay was cute and will make a fun connection for the rest of the books in this series.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that I've had some time in between reading this and writing my full review, Wendy doesn't bother me as much as while I was reading. I think part of the reason her back and forth was driving me crazy was because Max, our male MC, was just awesome! Not once did he give her reason to truly distrust him or doubt his sincerity. But as I thought more about it, Wendy had a not so stable family life growing up. Ok saying it that way I have to clarify...her parents loved to travel and were happy to just take each day wherever the wind would blow them. Wendy and her brother Brian enjoyed moments of that life but really wished for the chance to have a steady, stable home setting. So their parents decide to come back to the inn at Blue moon Bay and stay with Wendy's grandma. Just when they thought life was fantastic and they had a stable home, their parents let the wind guide them somewhere else. Wendy grew up believing that she had to do it all on her own and that no one else would ever be there for her. She did find an amazing group of friends, her Grandma was so loving and caring. They were a great support group for her but enter her boyfriend and then exit said boyfriend when they were in college and Wendy decides to take care of herself and walk away from it all because that's what everybody is going to eventually do to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at it that way I wasn't as frustrated with Wendy but became more sympathetic. Sure there were still moments when I wanted to tell her how good she really had it coming back to the inn but you can't get in and tell characters of a book to stop and smell the roses so I just kept reading waiting for all the clarification that would come at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Max was one of those dreamy, wonderful, almost too good to be true characters that shows up and rescues the damsel MC in distress. He was solid and stable and just what Wendy needed. Yet she feared that he would leave and that really caused her to hold back and miss out for a while.\n",

      "I love something between Max and Wendy, but I really don't like giving spoilers so I will just say this, kind of a pat on my back, when they were first talking about the legend of being \"kissed by the bay\" I had a feeling/guess about something and guess what...I was right. I know that is being super vague, sorry but not sorry. Because if I tell you then it takes away the fun of having the story revealed to you and enjoying the adventure yourself. This one is definitely a sweet, swoony romance story that also deals with some emotional issues(which I'm sure you've figured out from my earlier ramblings).\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved the flashbacks and memories of the grandma. I wish that we could have met her as readers more than just as a flashback but alas, once again I can't go in the story and change it but just enjoy it for what the author has created it as.\n",
      "\n",
      "The big question is, will Wendy be able to overcome all her insecurities? Will she be able to forgive her parents, say goodbye to her grandma and heal her relationship with her brother? Or will she turn her back on everything again and disappear from the heartache and keep it all inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's definitely a read I would recommend to any Susan Hatler fans, or even just fans who love a good swoony, rom-com type novel with fun, real characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Content wise it had a few steamy kisses but nothing further than kissing. I would say overall it was a great clean read.\n",
      "\n",
      "I received a copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Happy Reading!!!\n",

      "I gave up at 11% when the distraught woman who is apparently mourning the grandmother she virtually abandoned nine years ago, and who has been sobbing helplessly, suddenly sees a 'smoking hot' guy and goes weak at the knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "I COULD have coped with the appalling lack of sense, but not with the fact that this book is in desperate DESPERATE need of an editor - the author uses 'hot/hottest' three times in less than 100 words to describe this guy. The writing is just plain sloppy.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Wendy’s back in Blue Moon Bay after how many years living in Sacramento. If it were not for the will that her grandmother left to her and her brother, she wouldn’t want to go back. Her grandma wanted them to sell the Blue Moon Bay within a month, and that’s what she was gonna do. There was no reason for her to stay after all, wasn’t it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Max was a guest at the Blue Moon Bay inn for a business trip, but he soon wanted to stay and call it home. He didn’t expect to like the place, the beach, the people. What made him fall in love was the legend of the starcrossed lovers who kissed by the bay. He thought the legend might soon come true when he found the one he wanted to kiss under the blue moon. Problem was, the woman had no intention of staying nor coming back.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must admit, I had a hard time liking Wendy. Well, she’d been hurt when she was a child after their gallivanting parents left them to their grandma’s inn and never came back. As a kid, being abandoned was a big deal and she would never forgive them for that. No matter how many times I yelled at my Kindle to tell Wendy to move on, forgive and forget, be considerate, Wendy was stubborn and hard-headed. No wonder she grew up to be boring, brooding, annoying. I was ready to give up on her, but Max changed my mind. Somehow, this young, passionate hunk slowly entered my heart and stole my breath away. A lover of nature, a believer of legends, a man around town, a dog’s best friend, what more could a woman want?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, I found myself smiling and sighing. A tale as old as time definitely made this story captivating. Every Little Kiss shared by the characters made my night. Susan Hatler made me daydream again! I was kissed by the bay and fell in love!\n",

      "\n",
      "This was my least anticipated book in this series and it still found a way to worm itself into my heart! This wasn't was I was expecting Flynn's story to be like at all and yet it was so precious! The writing, as always, was fantastic and the characters are very well written.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was readying myself for Flynn's story to be all about the 101 women he planned to sleep with and dump after one night because that's the idea that has been planted throughout the past stories about fire fae. They're promiscuous and don't bond, no exceptions. Flynn was the most emotionally vulnerable of the fae princes presented so far and it was so sweet to see him like that. Due to happenings in his past, he doesn't believe he deserves anything good much less a soul bond. Watching him go through doubting himself and eventually learning to trust in himself was awesome!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was also expecting Callie to be this shy woman next to Flynn and she was also the complete opposite. She's very headstrong in the relationship and it contrasts well with how flighty Flynn naturally is in the same situation. I loved how she already knew about who she was to a very small degree. I liked that she didn't have to have a freakout moment when magic was finally brought up. Though I still find her trust in long lost relatives was very idiotic on her part. Her mom did what she did for a reason, so let's think twice about going back to the people she ran away from in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was expecting things to go very well in the end and even though they did the route that was taken was not what I was expecting. It was fantastic seeing Flynn coming into his own. I'm so interested in Ian's story now! I hope his mate will be a dragon because I'm also very fascinated about them in the world this author created.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Hot Dang! I was turning pages so fast, I almost melted my Kindle. Flynn has been the easy going/easily adapted to the human world Fae and I really wasn't expecting much from his story. But boy did Terry pulled out all of the stops. I am totally speechless on how amazing this story is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally we get Flynn's and Ian's background and the inside workings of the Fire Fae and Light Fae kingdoms. Callie is a new and exciting beacon. What starts out as a romance, soon turns into a drama, and finally morphs to an action packed tale. New characters are added to shake things up and they do it so well and make such an impression - I want them to get their own book. The story is topped off with a fun epilogue featuring Brett's new serfs (read the book!).\n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely love Terry's dragons and her Fae have proven to be just as great. I have enjoyed every one of Terry's books and highly recommend them.\n",

      "Bonds of fire🔥\n",
      "\n",
      "Flynn and Ian are out in a Club, which neither like because of the reaction the human women have to them. They are moving around in search of beacons to protect, when Callie comes onto their radar😁\n",
      "\n",
      "This story was amazing as it focuses on love, acceptance and the bonds of friendship❣️Flynn and the fact that he’s a fire fae has always believed that he was the weakest of the fae world. Luckily for him, Callie has grown up in the human world and accepts him for who he is and how he treats her and because of this, they form an unbreakable bond😍 But will Chaos find them and destroy all that they hold dear, or will it be someone they least expected to try sever their bond?🤷‍♀️\n",
      "\n",
      "I received an advanced copy and I willingly leave my honest review❤️ Looking forward to the next story by Terry.\n",

      "A Sweet, Sexy, Funny Fae Romance\n",
      "\n",
      "This story is heartwarmingly sweet and heartbreakingly emotional and just full of laughter and love, and fire and light. The love story is just so wonderfully romantic that it can't help touching your heart and feelings. It's also a story about finding your true self and powers and self-esteem and acceptance, and also about strong and warm friendship and true bonds. I just love this book so much! I strongly recommend this book to all who love paranormal romances and Terry Bolryder.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Held by Heat is the third book in Terry Bolryder’s new Wings, Wands and Soul Bonds Series. It is a steamy paranormal shifter romance that is written in first person, from the point of view of both the hero and heroine. This is a fun read, with great characters, a intriguing storyline, fiery chemistry, and no cliff hangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flynn, a rare warrior fire fae, is one several fae who has been sent to Earth to find beacons and protect the humans from the Chaos Fae. In his world love didn’t exist until he unexpectedly meets his match at a local club. Callie’s instincts draw her to Flynn, and when he accepts her usual request she knows she’s made the right decision. From the start, the chemistry between Flynn and Callie is explosive and hot but with unknown enemies all around them will their love and faith in each other be enough to find a happily ever after? Read it and find out!\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow!! Another great addition to this fantastic series. With each book and the history of each hero the author has done an amazing job building the Fae World for the readers to experience. The action, drama and romance also continues to grow. I can not wait for Ian’s story! I wonder who and what his soul bond will be.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the books in this series contain a happily ever after and can be read as a standalone, however, reading it in order will give you a better appreciation for the characters and the series itself.\n",

And I wasn’t pulled in by their romance, which lacked much of a connection between them other than physical. It’s a shame because I really like books two and three, but this entry just fell flat for me.\n",

      "Well, it read like the end of a trilogy, but I'm the 4th book, so I guess not. The whole King situation was handled very, very fast, so the plot is sort of back to book 1 (without the barrier). Tan, the MC, acts more like a 40 year old guy coming to an Elemental magic heavy world as the main character in a computer game. Light kisses with the gf, a mentally connected one, with no horny thoughts - not even once - is rather weird for a 17 year old boy with hormones raging and constant near death experiences.\n",

      "Kat Crimson is always one of my favorites because she puts smart in sexy. Her writing jumps off the page and lodges itself deep in the brain. I find her work hard to define since it's so unique, but one thing is it's always hot and Seduced by 2 may be the hottest one yet. This is a must read!\n",

      "==============\n",
      "The title of Seduced by 2: A Sexy Menage A Trois says it all. What you can't know from the title is how well-written and unrelentingly steamy this story is. A tempted and initially reluctant Maya succumbs to temptation with her boyfriend Max and his friend Foster. What unfolds is a master-class in finely wrought erotica. I'll certainly be looking forward to book 2.\n",

      "This was a very engaging, well written and sweet debut. It was hard to put down and had great comedic timing. Casey Steadman is ready to be the adult she envisions for herself. She's had her eye on a property that finally went up for rent and she sees it as a sign that things are going to change for the better. She's worked at the same place for many years and loves it, she has a great family and a supportive, yet hilarious set of best friends. Did I mention she has an alarmingly vast shoe collection? That I was deliriously envious of?? That's the one thing Casey will splurge on, save every last penny for that hot designer slingback or stiletto. But she also feels her life is somewhat stagnant, so getting the brooding and quiet landlord, Jake Miller, to agree to her lease is the game changer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jake Miller has made it his life mission to renovate and make good with his deceased mothers' properties. Having been absent for so much because of being in the army, Jake wants to make up for lost opportunities and make his mom's memory proud. He has his trusty and loyal German Shepherd, Remy, his power tools and little else, and he likes it that way. Until the lovely and colourful Casey comes to rent one of the duplexes. Then...everything changes, for the both of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I loved about this was the slow and realistic relationship development between Jake and Casey. There was no insta-anything, things progressed naturally and doing otherwise would have been unbelievable and in opposition with the heroes character. Jake was a quiet, short sentence kind of man. He's used to being alone and approaches everything with caution, including Casey, so him jumping headfirst into something would have been suspicious. He tried to deny his feelings, tried to avoid the churning, gut deep reaction to his new tenant, but eventually he realized it was futile.\n",
      "Casey was the opposite of Jake: effervescent, talkative, lively, and didn't hold anything back. They complemented each other beautifully, she brought out the best in him and made him the best version of himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were some very interesting developments here was well. I loved how this book not only focused on Jake and Casey, but has other sub-plots that kept everything interesting. Casey's besties, Rachel and Liz, were a riot! Loved them. Casey's family was awesome as well. Four older brothers and great parents, they spoiled Casey but were also there for her when she needed it. The funny banter between siblings was priceless! Loved that.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, not everything was as easy as Casey was used to. Jake had to deal with some pretty significant issues and I loved seeing how the author incorporated the reality of being with a soldier. It can be disheartening, stressful, tense and scary. It's not a glamorous life and Jake had to come to terms with being able to accept someone else accepting that about him. This is where the story shined for me, not that it didn't shine anywhere else! It did. But I loved how Jake and Casey both grew a little, both came out of their comfort zones and both were willing to risk their hearts for a shot at true love. Jake could have handled an issue he had with Casey better, I wanted him to be stronger than that, but I forgave him.\n",
      "The only other thing I wanted was for some more steam. I can completely appreciate closed door sex scenes, but if that's the way a book is set up, then I need lots of sexual tension and a more detailed work up to the sex. That way, a couples attraction is more believable, the, I-can't-keep-my-hands-off-you, type of simmering attraction. At least that's what I expect from CR.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, this was a lovely book filled with laughter, love and great writing. There were some very tense moments, some angsty moments and of course touching moments. The epilogue was fantastic, I loved it and only wish we got to see a bit of Jake overseas. I can't wait for Tate's and Rachel's book, I think that's going to be incredible as well. Looking forward to reading more of this authors work.\n",

      "⭐️⭐️ 2 STARS⭐️⭐️\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok I'm going to be honest (as ever) and give this one a 2 stars encouragement.\n",
      "\n",
      "I picked this one at an attractive price ($0.99) after the author contacted me for a review, and quite frankly this should have been a perfect read for me. Well, based on the synopsis, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, what the blurb promised never happened, Neighbors to Lovers trope, mixing in Enemies to Lovers, Army Hero, Sassy Heroine, a supporting and loving family with 4 protective brothers. ALL the aforementioned are favorite tropes of mine. ALL of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was lot of ideas, and maybe too much of them while the story never really \"started\". It seems all too forced, the characters sharing no chemistry at all in my opinion. I don't mind the absence of steam in my Contemporary Romances, but for 2 characters living next to each other, I never felt any sparks between them, I was told that there was some kind of attraction but it never showed. Even when the author introduced an incentive for the heroine to get jealous, it fell flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The author referred to Jake, the military hero, as an \"alpha male\". In my book, an alpha male, even struggling with his feelings and commitments issues, will SHOW possessiveness toward the woman he covets.\n",
      "But Jake seemed unfazed most of the time, and I don't mean only by the cold shoulder and facade he was wearing on purpose, I'm talking about his general attitude, even in his Pov, I never got from him an Alpha Hero vibe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The pace was very slow and despite the profusion of drama and new developments the author tried to throw in, the story never held my attention.\n",
      "I keep in mind that this is a debut novel, but as a romance reader, I read every drama and their lamas out there, so reading them all packed in this book was really overwhelming, and I had to (finally) close the book at 87% after rolling my eyes one time too many.\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, while this started with a good idea, By Your Side lost me at the excess of manufactured drama, lack of chemistry and dynamic. The ingredients were there, but the execution failed to satisfy this romance reader. Leaving a positive note about all the their relationship with Remy. Yes, I loved \"him\"!\n",

      "DNF at 30%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ahora que he decidido hacer esta reseña me acabo de dar cuenta que quizas no es el mejor momento, particularmente porque hace semanas que abandone esta lectura, y siento que esta opinion hubiese sido mucho mas completa de haberla escrito hace mas de un mes.\n",
      "Asi que ... no me gusto esta novela ( o lo poco que lei ), mi primer tropiezo fue con la protagonista femenina, ella me resulto muy muy cansina, a parte de superficial, insoportable e inmadura, sinceramente fue imposible conectar con ella y con sus \" problemas \" de adolescente.\n",
      "Por otro lado, me encontre con la trama, si se le pueda llamar asi. La premisa no representa en lo mas minimo la historia que te encontraras entre sus paginas, ademas durante el primer tercio que lei ( armandome de muuucha paciencia ) tuve la sensacion de que no sucede nada, un par de conversaciones entre los protagonistas que son tan cliches y clasicas que era capaz de decir la respuesta del otro mientras ponia los ojos en blanco, y varias escenas superficiales y aburridas del dia a dia de la protagonista femenina.\n",
      "Para terminar, By Your Side no fue lo que esperaba, creo que este estilo de libro ya esta muy muy visto ( leido ) y que si la autora no es capaz de darle un plus de originalidad, te encuentras frente a otro romance repetitivo y que te dejara muy indiferente.\n",
      "No lo recomiendo.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I don't usually laugh out loud while reading. In fact, I don't think I ever have. But while reading BY YOUR SIDE, I actually snorted. This, for me, is a BIG deal. Humor is subjective so when I find myself amused by a story, I automatically sit up a little straighter and pay closer attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Karla Sorensen crafted a well-rounded and vibrant story, and she did it while splashing plenty of humor throughout. Even though I don't have a lot in common with Casey, the heroine of this story, I understood her. It's a challenge for an author to write a character that you find yourself, as a reader, understanding, even when they make decisions you wouldn't make yourself. That's a testament to Ms. Sorensen's talent at writing inner monologue in a way that is not cumbersome to the story, or unnecessary fluff. All of the inner monologue, from both points of view, was *just enough* to understand their motivations and their desires.\n",
      "\n",
      "I read a lot of debut novels and what sets Karla Sorensen's novel apart from the rest is how fresh her characters are. In a sea of perfect heroines, Ms. Sorensen has created characters that are real, flawed; characters who make mistakes and grow throughout the story. The secondary characters were written so well that the moment I finished By Your Side, I wanted to keep reading. I wanted to stay in the world this author created a little while longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "By Your Side reads like a novel written by a seasoned author, an who is author confident in their craft. I am genuinely impressed that this is Ms. Sorensen's first attempt and am eagerly anticipating the subsequent novels in this series!\n",

      "SUNSET LIMITED: Five college friends who drifted into terrorist acts then, a bit of prison, and now highly successful careers. Except for Zip who either remained a terrorist or works for various governments. But he's in a Mexican prison, so the Big Chill group gets the band back together again. It's the kind of vehicle which would usually annoy me, but not in Harrison's hands. Here's a sample, a scene where Billy, one of the group who is now a billionaire international lawyer, is being chauffeured by his driver, Fred:\n",

      "This is a collection of three novellas all about 80-85 pages in length. I have not read him before, but I understand that his fiction was primarily that of novellas, and published three to a volume. I thought perhaps they would be inter-related, but they have absolutely nothing in common, at least so far as age, gender, setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brown Dog: Set in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, this story is told in the first person by a middle-aged, man who may or may not be of native heritage. This is a man who drinks heavily, lusts after women, and has little respect for the law. He occasionally works as a diver with a partner and is apparently homeless. It is a brilliant characterization.\n",
      "\n",
      ": The Sunset Limited is a train from New Orleans to the Coast, traveling through the mostly sparsely populated desert southwest. Gwen Simpson has called ahead so that it will stop at the platform near her ranch. This is an entirely different setting than , peopled with an entirely different type of characters. Gwen and 4 others were close friends in college 20 years earlier during the tumultuous Vietnam days. The five of them vandalized a recruiting office and spent some time in jail for their efforts. Gwen and three others have gotten on with their lives, but the fifth, Zip, continued his revolutionary ways and now sits in a jail in Mexico. This is the set-up for the reunion.\n",

      ": Clare was a trust fund woman, now in her early 50s, who has two grown children and has been married for 30 years. She cannot tolerate her husband and decides to leave him. Her leaving is done in an entirely unconventional way. She and her husband are driving home to Michigan after having visited their daughter in Iowa. She stops at a rest stop while her husband makes a daily phone call to his financial advisor. Clare leaves a note that her husband is abusing her, hops the fence, and disappears into a corn field. From there we are treated to her memories.\n",

      "I like the way Harrison writes. I thought the best of these three. I'll volunteer that if you are offended by language and the lustiness of men, this story might not be for you. I liked Gwen Simpson in . As to Clare in the title story ... meh. I sort of kept hoping that Harrison was telling that one with a dose of sarcasm, but as I always fail to understand sarcasm, maybe not. I feel fortunate that I've picked up other Harrison titles and will look forward to reading him again. This is just 4-stars, but it's hard to complain about reading 4-star books.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This was my first Jim Harrison book but it won't be my last. Like many of his books, this one consists of several, unrelated novellas. Each are great in their own right, but two in particular stand out. First, there's \"Brown Dog,\" which is one of the funniest pieces of fiction I've read in a while; Harrison had me laughing out loud nearly once a page. Irreverent, boisterous, bawdy, and utterly unpredictable, \"Brown Dog,\" follows its eponymous narrator (also known as B.D.), a part-Native American, skirt-chasing, scavenger diver, as he beds an anthropology student whose interest in B.D. is at least partly derived from his knowledge of a hidden Indian burial ground. \"Brown Dog\" reads like something Mark Twain would write if he were alive today. The plot is interesting, but plot isn't really Harrison's thing; read \"Brown Dog\" for the indelible voice, which puts one in the mind of an adult Huck Finn transplanted from the Mississippi River to the forests and lakes and dive bars of Upper Peninsula Michigan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next novella in the collection is “Sunset Limited,” which depicts a reunion of erstwhile radicals from the ’60s as they venture to Mexico to console, and then, perhaps, free, an old comrade who is now in jail on trumped up charges. The first half of the story expertly introduces us to each of the characters and fills in on their shared history; this is the part of the novella that works best, as Harrison deftly and succinctly juggles a half-dozen characters and decades worth of back-story. The last half of the novella, however, is a bit rushed and choppy. This was my least favorite story of the collection, but “least favorite” is a relative term, since all of the novellas here are worth your time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final novella is the “The Woman Lit By Fireflies,” which isn’t as rowdy as “Brown Dog” nor quite as ambitious as “Sunset Limited.” It may, however, be the most affecting of the novellas. The story follows Clare, a fifty-something woman who walks out on her husband at a rest stop in the middle of Iowa. As she spends a night in a cornfield, Clare reflects, with a rueful, humorous voice, on her life and the events that brought her to this moment. Of all the novellas, this one has the most complete arc, and its tender ending is a perfect note to go out on.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Another three wonderful novellas from Harrison. My favorite is \"The Woman Lit By Fireflies,' and not just because of the title, which is so evocative. It's a remarkably nuanced portrait both of an upper- middle-class suburban woman, Clare, who runs away from her husband. He is described as \"abusive\" on the back copy, but it's not quite so simple. Harrisons shows Clare is responsible for many of the decisions that have shaped her unhappy life.\n",

      "My first Jim Harrison book, certainly not my last. Too rich to gobble, but too interesting not to. He writes in voices, maintains perspectives, so distinct that it's vertiginous (to me). He firehoses the reader with original thoughts about freedom, love, personal morality, time (remembering and looking forward), physical context so dense and sensual (especially in natural settings) that it feels like being dropped into another person's body. I read it faster than it deserved. Another book for the read-again pile.\n",

      "Wow is all I can say! It was certainly enlightening to learn more about reincarnation and the development of our souls. I've read books/stories before about near-death experiences, guardian angels but never a book that discussed reincarnation. This book, in my opinion, was more inspiring than those motivational speakers or those self-help books. I hope to attend one of his seminars one day and look forward to reading his other books. If you/anyone you know ever question life or God, this book is a must read!\n",
      "If the author ever reads this/anyone who has read this book could answer my question:\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Every now and then a book comes along that gives you pause, changes your perspective on love, life and purpose. This was one of those books for me. Having read books on Edgar Cayce and by Jess Stern on this subject, I knew what I was in for. Still, the impact was not at all diminished. This will most likely send me onto a flurry of books on reincarnation. In any event, this is a great book to read for a myriad of reasons: If grieving the loss of a loved one, dealing with personal demons, illness or life-altering issues, or simply out of curiosity. It will not disappoint.\n",

      "I'm open to new ideas but very skeptical as one should be when faced with individuals who claim to hold the answers to life's hardest questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "First I'm disappointed that this doctor didn't have the intuition to validate his discoveries using the scientific method. As a scientist he should have naturally sought to test the claims of his patient. One way I can think of doing that is by asking her the whic horses will win upcoming races (as the book claims she was able to do) and then document the results. That would be more powerful than a bullshit book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second the patient seems to remember dates like 1500 bc. How did she know the term 'BC' before while regressing to a lifetime when Christ was not yet born.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third I'm sick of this idea of God(s) or guides communicating to one individual to instruct him that he has been chosen to enlighten the masses and make a lofty profit out of it. At least this time the divine vehicle wasn't instructed he must have sex with a bunch of women and prepubescent girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forth it's intellectually patronizing to push the idea of the impending doom after it has been milked by cult leaders for centuries. No the end is not upon us and no human beings aren't the worst creatures in nature. In the book a spirit guide tells the doctor how human beings are to learn from nature to be harmonious like the beasts of the wild and how we, being ugly creatures, will end up killing our species. In nature animals often drive one another to extinction and the apparent harmony we see is when the weak animals have been driven out leaving a seemingly designed balance. I'm not saying human beings are angels but rather that all creatures that have power can abuse it.\n",

At first Catherine didn't want to be hypnotized, but she began to feel much better, was not so afraid of life. She talks much of the Masters who know so much. If one has faith in the Masters they will guide one. Catherine, at first, does not have faith or trust the Masters. She becomes more trusting of them.\n",

      "Water by the Spoonful is Quiara Algeria Hudes Pulitzer winning play. Hudes had been producing plays since the age of fifteen and attended Brown University to study under the tutelage of Paula Vogel. Spoonful is part of Hudes' trilogy featuring Elliot Ortiz, an Iraq war veteran who has been coping with life since his discharge and his birth mother Odessa also known as Haiku mom who runs a chat room for recovering crack addicts. A powerful drama that runs the gamut of human emotions, Water by the Spoonful is a powerful piece of playwrighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elliot Ortiz has been discharged from Iraq for six years. Working steadily at Subway, he lives in North Philadelphia among an extended family of aunts, uncles, and cousins. His closest family member is his cousin Yazmin, an adjunct professor of music at a nearby university. Although both in their twenties, both cousins have taken over as head of their family because many uncles are since deceased, including their aunt Ginny, Elliot's adoptive mother, who has just passed on. At the play's opening we meet the cousins as Elliot is still grappling with the demons of his Iraqi past and Yazmin struggling to keep him afloat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather than a play in two acts, the play is fourteen scenes long as Hudes alternates between Elliot and Yazmin's reality with Odessa running her chat room. Odessa has been a failure as a mother, leaving Elliot to be raised by her sister Ginny, a pillar of the Philadelphia Puerto Rican community. Although a poor mother, Odessa has been sober for over six and has successfully moderated a chat room, saving hundreds of lives. We meet three such characters in Orangutan, Chutes and Ladders, and Fountainhead, all striving to be sober and amount to achieving happiness in their lives. Elliot can not fathom that his mother has created something positive and attempts to derail what she achieved. As a result Elliot appears in asides in the chat rooms with Yazmin attempting to dissuade him from crumbling Odessa's remade life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although a Pulitzer winner for its content matter about Iraqi veterans and drug rehabbers, I did not find Water by the Spoonful at quite the level as other Pulitzer winners that I have read. Yes, the story is powerful about people overcoming addiction and remaking their lives. I even found some of the interchanges in the chat rooms as well as the dialogue between Elliot and Yazmin comedic. Yet, with many characters and storylines, the play felt disjointed at times. I felt that if Hudes had focused on Elliot's relationship with Odessa and Ginny, that the play might have been even more powerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quiara Alegria Hudes has brought the dangers of drug usage among veterans to the forefront in Water by the Spoonful. She navigates issues as PTSD, drug addiction, and adoption, as all some to a nexus in both Elliot and Odessa's lives. A Puerto Rican from Philadelphia, Hudes has chosen to write a trilogy of plays about issues close to her personally. Perhaps I would have known the story better if I started with Hudes' first installment Elliot's Fugue. Water by the Spoonful on its own is powerful but the viewer meets the characters in the middle of their story. On its own, I rate Pulitzer winning Water by the Spoonful 3.75 stars. This rating may have been higher had a I read its predecessor first.\n",

      "One of my reading goals this year is to read more play scripts, focusing on contemporary scripts. I've start this journey with . , the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Quiara Alegria Hudes, tells the parallel story of crack addiction and how it effects those around the user. Eliott, an ex-marine and caretaker of his mother, came back from Iraq with an injured leg, Trying to get his life together, and to take care of his ill mother, Elliott takes a job at a Subway. His cousin, Yazmin is an adjunct music professor at a local University. The two find that Eliott’s mother has been sent to the hospital due to an illness, but she doesn’t last long and quickly passes.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the not so distant world exists a group of recovering addicts, who come together to get the support and strength they need to stay clean, in an online chat room. The drug of choice, crack cocaine. Orangutan, an adopted recovering addict from Asia, who is 95 days sober, Chutes&Ladders, a former user who has since settled down after losing touch with his family and who has become an IRS customer service representative, and Haiku-Mama, the moderator of the chat room who is the rock of support to all, except her family when they need her the most. Most recently, the funeral planning of her sister, Eliott’s adoptive mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While, is a show of harsh reality, we've seen this before; there's nothing new here, nothing that is revelatory. Where Hudes succeeds, is in writing dialogue that is witty and heart wrenching. Hudes breathes new life into this 70's style drama. It’s very dense, very rough, but is very real. Many people, unfortunately, will relate to the characters in this piece. Quiara Alegria Hudes’ has written a script of nasty truth that can only help shine a light on the fact, that if you are struggling with a  vice, you are not alone.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This brilliant, Pulitzer-winning play touches on a lot of hot topics, including war, addiction, and Puerto Ricans' eternal struggle to claim their place in the US mainstream. But most importantly, it is a story about family--about honoring the bond to all the people that have raised and cared for you, about building a new family for yourself when your biological relatives have turned their backs on you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially, the play is divided between two groups of characters. In the first group, we have Yazmin Ortiz, an adjunct music professor, and Yazmin's cousin, Elliot, who served in the Iraq War. Like the Puerto Rican family I married into, the Ortizes are a large, interconnected mess of people. Yazmin and Elliot are cousins, but Elliot claims two of Yazmin's aunts as his mother. As we learn, he is the biological son of one aunt, Odessa, but was raised by another aunt, Ginny. Exactly why Odessa gave Elliot up is revealed in a crucial, moving scene in the middle of the play, and I will not reveal it here. Suffice it to say, Yazmin's aunt/Elliot's adopted mom Ginny dies, and the event forces members of the family who have successfully avoided each other for a long time to clash and try to sort out their differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second group of characters is comprised of crack addicts who support each other in an internet chatroom. Odessa is the chatroom moderator and the link between the family and internet scenes. Known to her addict friends as \"Haikumom,\" Odessa is a wise, patient online presence who \"censors\" the other characters' obscene outbursts. Though we learn that several people have tried to find support in the chatroom environment, the play only introduces us to three characters in addition to Odessa/Haikumom. The first is Chutes&Ladders, a middle-aged African American IRS employee who seems to take pride in living an uneventful, passionless life without crack. Orangutan, a transnational adoptee, has returned to her country of birth, Japan, in an effort to reconnect with her birth parents -- an adventure Chutes&Ladders opposes because he cannot fathom undertaking it by himself (or sober). Fountainhead, a new addition to the group, is a white, wealthy man who wants to recover from his addiction without revealing it to his wife or kids. Privileged and naïve, Fountainhead quickly becomes a punching bag for Chutes&Ladders and Orangutan, who believe that a person has to hit rock bottom before he can be serious about breaking the habit. They are probably right.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the play progresses, the walls between these worlds break down. Odessa/Haikumom meets John/Fountainhead for a lunch that is interrupted by Yazmin and Elliot, Yazmin and Elliot log into the chatroom under Odessa's alias, etc. Along the way, we learn that Odessa and Elliot have both revealed to one of these worlds without anticipating that they will be discovered in the other, and Odessa decides to sell her computer--her best ally in her war against addiction--to buy flowers for Ginny's funeral. Selling the computer is a symbolic gesture that in the context of the play represents Odessa's \"choice\" between the biological family that sees her as a let-down and an addict and the makeshift, digital \"family\" that sees her as a martyr. Does Odessa make the right choice? I will leave it to you decide.\n",
      "\n",
      "I read this play with the students in my \"Literary Diversity\" class. To be honest, I picked it in a hurry when I was planning the syllabus because I needed a play (not my area of expertise) and because the Ortiz family reminded me so much of my in-laws. However, reading it again these last few days with a group of other people and the chance to slow down and think about how it is put together has helped me appreciate it as a great story and a fine literary achievement. Like I said earlier, the play addresses timely topics, but it does so in a timeless way. The playwright, Quiara Alegría Hudes, is best known for her work on the Tony-winning musical , but confirms that she is far more than a one-hit wonder. The play is the second in a trilogy about the experiences of Elliot, a Puerto Rican man who fought a war for a country that barely recognizes his right to live in it, and I look forward to digging into the other two installments. In short, this is a great, teachable play, and one that I expect to revisit.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Quiara Alegría Hudes is not a name I knew, but she won the 2012 Pulitzer prize for this play, Water by the Spoonful. It turns out she also wrote the book for In the Heights, and won a Tony nomination for it. The lyrics were written by Lin Manuel Miranda. I saw the show, but forgot that it was not Miranda who created the entire musical, as he did for Hamilton. Hudes has a unique mind. Her originality is rife with significance on many levels. While her non-linear style in this play makes for some confusion, it also adds richness, especially since midway through the play the story’s meaning and import become crystal clear. She combines fourth-wall realism with uncanny, cyber-space realities whose pseudonyms (online usernames) and virtual locales are confounding, at first. Her virtual realities include folks with names such as “Fountainhead,” “Chutes and Ladders,” and “Orangutan.” Eventually, we learn their real-world names and their connection to the characters who launch the show. The play is about family, addiction, loyalty and protection. It took me into places and people I would never otherwise encounter. Hudes is a young and a masterful playwright. Her hefty opus are the sweet fruit of her talent combined with her Puerto Rican heritage, tight family bonds, and her mother’s encouragement to tell the family’s stories.\n",
      "2_ Elliot: A Soldier’s Fugue is the first a trilogy of plays. This play was a 2007 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. It’s a good play, but not as complex or compelling as Water by the Spoonful. Hudes credits family members for inspiring some of the dialogue in the play. The play involves three generations of soldiers. Grandpa served in Korea, Pop in Vietnam, Elliot in Iraq. Elliot’s mom, Ginny, Pop’s wife, was an army nurse in Vietnam. That’s where she met Pop. Some of the elders’ memories seep into the dialogue in intriguing ways. Pop, for instance, recalls “poems” that his unit created to chant while marching. These include: “One two three four. / We’re gonna jump on the count of four. / If I die when I hit the mud / Bury me with a case of bud / A case of bud and a bottle of rum / Drunk as hell in kingdom come. / Count off: One two three four.” And “One two three four. / We’re gonna charge on the count of four. If my heart begins to bleed / Bury me with a bag full a weed / A gag full a weed and a / Bottle of rum / Laugh at the devil in kingdom come. / Count off: One two three four.”\n",
      "The “fugue” of the title is a reflection of the verbal fugue here, consisting of four sets of intersecting stories. The playwright herself is an accomplished pianist. In this play, Grandpa is a flutist whose melodies, played for his fellow soldiers, encouraged or consoled them. With his playing, he taught them the difference between major and minor keys, and they learned to request something in the requisite key, depending on the situation. Grandpa muses: “of everything Bach wrote, it is the fugues. The fugue is like an argument. It starts in one voice. The voice is the melody, … the statement. Another voice creeps up on the first one. Voice two responds to voice one. They tangle together. They argue, they become messy. They create dissonance. Two, three, four lines clashing. You think, good god, they’ll never untie themselves. How did this mess get started in the first place? …It’s all about untying the knot. … Major keys, minor keys, all at once on top of each other. … In Korea my platoon fell in love with Bach. All night long, firing eight-inch howitzers into the evergreens. Flute is very soothing after the bombs settle down. They begged me to play. ‘Hey, Ortiz, pull out that pipe!’\n",
      "One reviewer wrote: “Pop is a naïve young man, who takes his father’s flute with him to war though he knows not how to play, and eventually has his high spirits shattered as his tour drags on. … Elliot copes with the new horrors of modern war. …when wounded, he suddenly finds himself a hero, albeit a carefully-constructed hero, shaped and molded by reporters and TV producers to reflect a certain version of war and the American soldier.\n",

      "The Fault in Our Stars is such a great romance novel that is actually really sad, but those are the best types of books. When I read this book, it had a major plot twist that I was not expecting, but it made the book a lot better than I thought it would be. I would recommend it, even though a lot of people have read it before. I chose to read this because I saw it at the store and I knew that I needed to read it because everyone else was. So, this book is about this girl named Hazel Grace Lancaster that has thyroid cancer, so she has a lot of trouble breathing because her lungs don't function properly. She's told that she needs to go to a support group, and meets a boy named Augustus Waters, and he has osteosarcoma, so he had to get his leg amputated. It's sad that Hazel still had cancer, but it's a good thing that Gus passed it. They both fall in love with each other, basically, and they recommend books to each other as well. Hazel told Gus he should read An Imperial Affliction, which is about a girl who has cancer, and Gus told Hazel to read Price of Dawn, which is about stormtroopers and things like that. Since they both really liked An Imperial Affliction they want to know what happens after so they plan a trip to go to Amsterdam to talk to the author, Peter Van Houten. Unfortunately, when they went, Peter was rude to them. But before they went to Amsterdam, Hazel got sick again and the doctors said she couldn't go, but she did after all. On that trip, Gus said that he had a body scan and i showed that he had cancer again, all over this body. In the end, Gus died, which I not see coming because I though Hazel was the one going to die in the book. My favorite part was when they had a nice, romantic dinner in Amsterdam. But overall, this book was fantastic.\n",

      "Leer es un acto solitario. Salvo que no es así. No cuando tienes la dicha de pertenecer a una familia de (jóvenes) lectores que empiezan a explorar libros por su cuenta y que, como es el caso en la música, te invitan a conocer y compartir los libros que les han gustado. Y así como en la música haces excelentes descubrimientos gracias a tus hijos, estoy empezando a descubrir libros gracias a ellos que no sólo no me arrepiento haber descubierto sino que me iluminan el día y despiertan respeto por su naciente criterio.\n",
      "\n",
      "No es el primer caso en que leo algo sugerido por ellos. Así conocí a Carlo Frabetti, Dark Lord, Matilda o el Diario de Greg, leídos todos con gusto.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pero este librito que relata la historia de amor entre dos adolescentes me conmovió. Es un libro aparentemente sencillo, lineal, escrito en una prosa ligera y simple. Pero sabemos desde Hemingway y Steinbeck que no hay nada más poderoso que unas líneas escritas con palabras simples. Que no hay nada que implique más trabajo que una estructura fluida. Además, el hecho que los adolescentes, que apenas están conociendo el mundo, estén muriendo de cáncer, crea una dimensión profunda e inesperada a la historia. Pues adivinas desde siempre que el amor que empiezan a descubrir será el último. Sabes que alguno de ellos, quizá ambos, morirán. Y también lo saben ellos.\n",
      "\n",
      "La historia es contada en primera persona por la protagonista, Hazel. Y lo impactante de ese ángulo es que muestra que, a veces, quienes mejor asumen el dolor, sufrimiento y miedo de estar muriendo de cáncer son los enfermos mismos. Que el horror de su situación perturba, a veces, más a los que estamos alrededor que a ellos mismos. Que, al final del día, lo más importante de estos niños no es su enfermedad sino que son simples y bellos humanos, hambrientos de vida. Que pueden incluso encarar con humor y distancia la terrible situación en la que están, en la que sólo son \"daños colaterales de la evolución\", y no dramáticas víctimas del destino.\n",
      "\n",
      "Y que esa hambre de vida -- mayor quizá que la de aquellos que no sabemos cuanto tiempo viviremos pero sabemos (o creemos saber) que serán muchos años -- incluya amar y enamorarse es obviamente inevitable. Aún si saben que, como dice Hazel, son como granadas que, al morir, herirán a todos los que estén cerca, eligen amar por que es simplemente parte de su humanidad. De hecho, esa humanidad hace imposible que no lo hagan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Un corto párrafo en particular refleja todos estos elementos: la humanidad, el poder de unas sencillas palabras, la conciencia del ser (y el vacío infinito e inevitable del no-ser) y, simplemente, el amor. Lo copio aquí in extenso. Habla Augustus, el adolescente enamorado de Hazel:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout in the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you\".\n",
      "\n",
      "No hay nada más que decir.\n",
      "\n",
      "O quizá si, quizá hay que decir siempre, como Hazel al acabar el libro: \"I do Augustus, I do\".\n",

      "Yes, it's considered a YA novel, but this writer expects nothing less from his readers than any writer should. Like Hazel in this book, I awarded four stars to it because I'm still waiting to read that five star book. This isn't it, but it's close.\n",

      "I don't think I have the capability of rating such an amazing book! It made me cry, it made me smile at the same time! It introduced me to a new meaning of life, to live for the people who cares, to not overthink about being a virtuous person! Made me realize the simple thing that, making the people who cares happy, doing something small for them is enough to make my life worth living.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not a big fan of this genre. But this book introduced me to a whole new world! I have always thought about death, about doing something to make the world a better place, to make the future generation remember me. I always had this Augustus Watersic intention to be great, to sacrifice for the greater good.\n",

      "I have been searching for an answer for such a long time, and I think I have found it finally. Oh. My. God. This book is just too good!\n",

      "This book will put you through a emotional roller-coaster. You will become deeply attached to the characters through out the book and some of the chapters will leave you crying and thinking why did I choose this book in the first place, but in the end you'll be glad you read it. In fact I now wish I have started reading it earlier!\n",

      "Cole fractures his spine during a fight – and it’s bad. So bad, he ends up in a wheelchair and the doctors say there isn’t much else they can do for him. So bad he will probably walk with crutches the rest of his life. His manager sends him from Las Vegas to Wisconsin to be helped by a physical therapist named Katie, the manager’s niece. Cole is angry about this but grudgingly goes. Katie just happens to be house sitting for someone in a wheelchair so her house is the perfect set-up for Cole. What Cole doesn’t know is that Katie’s ex-boyfriend named Carter, is stalking her. Already abusing her, she has been on the run from him, but forced to come back to her hometown after her dad had a stoke. Because of Facebook, Carter now knows Katie is back, and he starts his erratic behavior again. Cole finds out and vows to keep Katie safe. You get the rest of the picture. The suspense is so predictable in this one. Stalker- abusive ex vs. new mma fighter boyfriend. With the perfect heroine in between.\n",
      "\n",
      "First – let’s point out the fact that Cole fractures his spine and doctors are pretty sure he will never walk again. I’m not sure how long he is in the hospital and then wheel chair but let’s assume it’s in the multiple months range. Wouldn’t his muscle tone be – weak? Dare I say, kind of gone? But I’m pretty sure he still had perfect abs and perfect legs and perfect everything when he bounces out of the wheelchair one day. Oh yeah – it takes him NO time to be able to walk, like really walk, once he meets Katie. What happened to the life-time injury?\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing that bothered me – I felt it was really odd that Cole would actually move in with Katie. Maybe while he was in the wheelchair but what about once he could walk? Wouldn’t it be more appropriate if they didn’t live together as strangers? They become familiar with each other quick – too quick to be believable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also – Katie was very poorly treated by her ex-boyfriend.\n",

      "\n",
      "Katie is very wary to become intimate with Cole because of this. Cole doesn’t force her or anything but he does push her which really annoyed me. Katie’s past abuse is horrific. The first time they are intimate he lets her tie him up so that she feels more safe, but at that point I don’t even think she was ready for that. It was all about Cole’s pressing need to have her rather than her dealing with being raped. Cole felt selfish.\n",

They say it’s a miracle he can walk, if that’s what you call his crutch-dragging limp. Unwilling to give up on him, Cole’s manager sends the injured fighter to the best physical therapist he knows: his niece, Katie Miller. When Cole arrives in the small town of Somerset, Wisconsin, he quickly discovers his sly manager may have had reasons other than rehab for sending him to this frozen tundra.\n",

      "After a year of running from an abusive ex-boyfriend, Katie has returned to her hometown to care for her father, who’s recovering from a stroke. When Uncle Marcus calls in a favor, she reluctantly finds herself taking on a rancorous MMA fighter, broken at the height of his career. He’s insanely sex-on-a-stick hot—and everything she loathes in a man.\n",

You know she's been through some fucked up stuff and hasn't really recovered, but the extent of her abuse isn't revealed until after the first third or so of the book. Her trust issues and fear are completely understandable, and even though they interfere with her relationship with Cole, I was more focused on rooting for her to truly rather than just getting over it.\n",

His anger and bitterness over his injury and the potential end of his fighting career tore at my heart strings. He was so powerful, strong and fighting it was hard to imagine him never being able to do it again. His drive to recover and get back to fighting strength was admirable and hot. And is caring and patience with Katrina, and his resolve to not just be with her but heal her brought tears to my eyes\n",

      "I know I keep using the word love, but really I loved about this book. Cole and Katrina were for each other. They both were damaged, albeit in completely different ways, and they were what the other one needed to heal. There was a lot of angst surrounding their relationship; Cole had never been serious about a woman before and didn't know where things with Katrina were headed, and Katrina was unsure if Cole felt as deeply about her as she did about him. Throw in Katrina's ex boyfriend and there was some drama surrounding their budding relationship. Saying Katrina's ex is psycho is putting it mildly. He does some really messed up shit to Katrina in this book, both in the past and the present. I was amazed at how scary he was!\n",

      "At times I was Katrina and Cole's relationship would develop , but the length of time it took for Katrina to become comfortable with Cole and for Cole to develop deeper feelings for Katrina felt realistic and put them on more even ground with each other. The growth of their relationship and feelings for each other felt really genuine and touching. Cole was the ultimate hero, but he was able to keep himself in check in order not to frighten Katrina. So sexy. And when they did finally get it on, they were on It made the wait totally worth it.\n",

The climax to this book had me holding my breath and be completely incapable of putting this book down. Someone would have had to pry my kindle out of my before interrupting me reading the last 10% of this book. Katrina and Cole get their HEA, and it's really sweet and made me for them!\n",

      "Honestly, I am getting really frustrated by book ratings, especially on Amazon. This author and book has a nearly 5 star rating on Amazon, so I bought it. However, I feel like it is entirely undeserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, there are two three major flaws in this story, and several smaller ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "* First, this is a time travel story. However, very little is made about the glaring differences that would certainly exist between a modern woman, and the early 1800's in Dodge city. Several people wander through the scene, when this woman first appears in stiletto heels, and only one character thinks (not speaks) that her shoes look like weapons. Her language draws little comment, and her modern sensitivities seem unaffected by necessity of having to adjust to 19th century hardships. We never hear her complain, or her her insecurities about how she should wear her hair, what about bathing, what about adjusting to the food, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "* There are also several glaring missing details. Upon showing up in the past, she is abruptly tossed into jail...where she spends some time. She never has to pee, or eat, or bathe. In fact throughout the story, these things rarely even pop up - other than a few meals that she is provided with. Also, upon finding another time traveler, she is so excited that she doesn't even ask where or when he came from. Little things like that. Another: she finally procured \"sensible footwear\". Well, what does that mean? What kind? What did they look like? Did she get blisters? Miss her Nikes? Heaven's! This had great potential, but the missing details meant that this entire aspect of the story missed the mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Finally, and blaringly, is the conclusion of the story. Not only is it rushed...it is ridiculous! I admit I was able to look past other plot failings and enjoy the story up until the end. Before going back to her own time, the hero dies. However, after finding herself back in the future, she meets him - reincarnated and with most of his memories intact - in a museum parking lot. Upon finding him, in this new reincarnation, she takes absolutely no time to adjust to the idea...she is just simply in love immediately, and gets in the car with him where they drive off only to stop at a costume store to pick up Old West costumes to spice up their sex life. What?! Come on. Again, great missed opportunity for a more realistic believable ending that we readers could have invested in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of how much 'success' this reader has had with other books, after this read I would not read her again...except that based on the inflated ratings of this book, I actually bought another of hers. So, I guess I will give her one more try, but I'm honestly not expecting much.\n",

      "My Truman\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed this book. The heroine, Jessica was very strong and plucky. Accidentally time traveling to 1881 Dodge City, Kansas wear jeans with a zipper (gasp), red stilettos and a leather jacket, she immediately drew the attention of the Sherriff. Sherriff Truman Wade is so yummy. A quick draw with his six shooter, and an earnest heart, he is the stuff women's fantasies are made of. Truman is gorgeous, wears a Stetson and can whistle for his horse, Thunder, who will come running. Why is that so hot? Oh, I know, because if the horse is loyal to his man, that means all fingers point to the man being a good one, and the horse being a great one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jessica soon finds herself in a heap a trouble. Accused of killing Left Hand Lou, she gets put in jail, then eventually a financial reward for killing him. Gotta love the old west! Lol. But is all this jail time just a way for Truman to keep her close? I love that the town nicknames her \"Junebug Jess\". Jess hates Junebugs and was trying to kill on that was caught in her hair when Left Hand Lou fell dead at her feet. When she explains that she was trying to kill a Junebug, the town thinks she's whackadoo because they've never heard of Junebugs. Well, that and she keeps telling everyone she was in a car accident and needs to use the phone. She thinks she's landed in the middle of a reality show where they take people and make them live in another era of time for all of us to laugh at.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jess is quick though and tries to assimilate. But forgets to do things like tie her hair up, which that alone gets Truman's blood pumping. Their's is a great love story.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has a HEA, but not one I expected. I was hoping for something a little different. But it was still great.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Jessica Delaney after flipping her car finds herself transported into the past. The Dodge city of 1881 is not in any way recognisable to her. When she’s mistaken for an outlaw and comes to the interest of the local sheriff her dilemma intensifies. Soon Jessica and Wade are fighting a red hot attraction but with both of them keeping their secrets close to their chests is their tentative new beginning doomed before it even gets started.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taken by the cowboy is a quick read and though it was mostly enjoyable it wasn’t incredibly taxing and felt a bit light on insights and descriptive language. The world immersion wasn’t the best and lacked basic expansion. I also found the characters themselves a bit one dimensional and I wasn’t convinced of the chemistry between Jessica and Truman. In fact, I found their connection disappointing. I also found the ending a bit rushed and not very satisfying either though there is a HEA just a bit of a strange one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like my historicals rich in detail and this just didn’t deliver that vibe for me. The main characters here are mostly likeable but there’s also a lot of stereotyping as well. I think the best way to explain it is that all of the bones of the story were all there but it hadn’t been padded out enough and was then light on all the little details that make you believe your in the past. Overall though if you looking for an easy story that won’t tax too much this should work.\n",

      "A time travel Western!!! Ke-wl. I’m guessing here, but I think this one is one of the the books in the new Amazon Line that Connie Brockway is part of and can I just say I am So In with this? I’m glad I have an i-pad with a Kindle app so I can read these books. A Western Time Travel isn’t a trope you see very often. Since I really like both, that’s why I was sold on this book right away.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to enjoy a time travel book, you have to be willing to suspend belief more that say a contemporary or romantic suspense or even some historical. Luckily I’m able to do that pretty well so I was able to enjoy this book quite a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jessica is a modern day heroine thrust back into the old West. Of course at first she has a hard time believing what’s happened. I found her reaction quite believable. I enjoyed her as a heroine. She was smart and intelligent and wasn’t intimidated by her situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Truman Wade, our hero was just plain yummy-licious. A combination gunslinger AND a sheriff; one who wears spurs and a gun; one who has blue eyes and is strong confident, hunky and a sense of humour is very hard to resist. He doesn’t know what to make of Jessica, or Junebug as he calls her. She’s not like any woman he’s met before. He’s attracted to her but knows she is keeping secrets and is reluctant to get involved despite being very attracted to her, in case those secrets will compromise his job as sheriff. And Jessica is very attracted to Truman but she is also reluctant to get involved since she is determined to return to her family in her own time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The resolution to this book was a bit unexpected and had me almost weepy. Not to worry though, it is a romance and has a HEA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon knew what they were doing when they put this one on my recommend list. I really enjoyed it. And at that price? My advice is to give it a try. It says on the site that this book will be available in print in August.\n",

      "Jessica Delaney aka Junebug Jess is transported back in time to 1881 when she is in a car accident. While trying to figure out where she really is a dead body drops in front of her and the people of Dodge believe she shot and killed the outlaw, Lou. Truman Wade is the sheriff and arrests Jessica until he can get the facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plot had a lot of potential but it lacked something. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. There is a lot of running and hiding as the baddies are trying to kidnap/kill/or worse Jessica. A bit of mystery as to who actually killed the outlaw and what it is that the baddies are looking for. It was an okay read and some parts better than others.\n",

      "Well, this was the first new release I was looking forward to for 2010 and it's not a propitious start.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll make it short and not-so-sweet. Duke has an arranged marriage from childhood. Blows it off forever, intending at some point to cancel out on it, then decides 'what the heck, I'll go for it'. By then the young woman doesn't want to marry him because ... sit down, it's gonna be a shockah ... she loves him so much (after seeing him two times in her life) and knows he doesn't love her back. Wow. You might want to get a glass of water after that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, I'm being facetious. It's fine as a start, but it's not enough to make a girl act like the selfish, childish, moron this heroine (who starts out just fine, BTW) turns into. She's not a harpy. That's the one plus. She doesn't turn into a spiteful shrew, but she does turn into a reckless airhead extraordinaire, trying to make the duke so angry that he'll cry off. Because she loves him so much and he doesn't love her. She is in no doubt of this, of course, because she overheard him saying that during the event of their second meeting when she was sixteen and he was in his late 20's. So ... it's pretty much settled and will never change, as anyone can see. *insert eyeroll here*\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, TAW has written a couple of my favorite books and I hold her ability in high esteem. And yes, I'm being scathing. Even bitchy. Because she has more talent than this and it ticks me off to see it wasted. Her biggest plus is the incredible chemistry she creates between her characters. But here, the heroine is acting like such a booby and the hero is so stoically busy with other things that they don't really spend any time together where they get to be playful or unrestrained. There's nothing for the reader to hang their expectations on until the last couple of chapters and those are padded with interminable sex scenes so we still aren't getting much banter or camaraderie. In all honesty, I thought the entire thing would have been much more satisfying if the hero had sent her back to her parents and they'd started the whole thing over. But I got the feeling I was supposed to expect to be paying a penance because he was approaching things from a typical POV of the times. And very amiably, too. Sorry, but he wasn't the villain of the piece. Just a dunderhead for not kicking Claire to the curb so she could grow up.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing happens that is foreshadowed in the earlier books in the series, but even that comes off as lackluster when it should have had a strong emotional impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow. I hate to be so harsh on a writer I truly like and who I'm rooting for. I've complained about her well worn templates that don't fit her strengths and this one does change up the formula a little, I'll grant that. But it still doesn't play to her unique talent and that's too bad.\n",

      "Skip it. :(\n",

      "Somehow, this is my first Tracy Anne Warren book. I know - unbelievable. You'd think I would have come across her in one of my Avon HR binges before now, but it appears that her series catchphrase -- Everyone knows the Byron brothers are \"mad, bad and dangerous.\" -- discouraged me. Shocking, I know.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Byron brother in At the Duke's Pleasure, Edward, the Duke of Clybourne, is hardly dangerous, but I consider him abso-fucking-lutely mad for putting up with the heroine, Lady Claire. Just take a list of the most annoying HR tropes, and Claire has a hand in almost all of them. Is this a secret time travel novel? That's the only thing that could explain why she acts like a spoiled, impetuous 16-year-old.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, Edward and Claire have been engaged since she was an infant. It's an arranged marriage, you see, which is what just about everyone back in the day did to create powerful family alliances. As a teenager, Claire is thrilled to be engaged to Edward, because fuck yeah, he's hot AND a duke. She may as well have seen a unicorn using the Loch Ness Monster as a raft for all the more common hot and available dukes actually were. Edward, for his part, is less than thrilled because he feels like he's engaged to a child. A besotted 15-year-old Claire overhears Edward saying as much and is naturally heartbroken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever. She's a kid. By the time she grows up, I'm sure she'll understand what marriage is like in her time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Right. So, Edward comes back several years later to retrieve his bride. Claire's blossomed into a refined beauty, and she's been raised to be a duchess, so he figures it's a win-win. Note to Avon heroes: NEVER assume it's a win-win.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Claire is older, she is not wiser. Still consumed with love for Edward, she decides she simply CAN'T marry him if he doesn't love her back. God, I hate this story line. But Edward won't release her from the engagement because it would make them both look bad and inconvenience his carefully arranged plans. So Claire goes to her dad, an earl who is quite pleased with the match, and asks him to release her from the betrothal. And her dad is like:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, Claire agrees to go to London to \"get to know\" Edward as his fiancee while quietly scheming ways to convince him to jilt her.\n",
      "\n",
      "To recap: Claire wants the man she loves to jilt her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that you know what a hare-brained idiot we're working with, I'm sure it's easy for you to see how implausible this story will be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claire has younger sisters. All they really have to do in life is get married and create heirs. And I get it, the past sucked donkey balls. But this is the world Claire lives in, and she pisses all over it. How marriageable do you think Claire's sister will be after...\n",
      "\n",
      "She dances THREE TIMES at a ball with a man who's well-known for ruining another young lady, smokes cigars with noblemen, openly defies her fiance in public, races carriages in broad daylight, gambles with gentlemen, cuts all of her hair off, DRESSES AS A BOY TO SNEAK INTO A GENTLEMEN'S CLUB AND GAMBLE SOME MORE (this one irritated me the most), and leaves a ball with the bad man who ruins lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, all of these things would usually cause a man to cry off, but they would also RUIN you and your family and bring into question the character of the people who associate with you. Claire lives in this fantasy world where all she has to do is drive away the man she loves (I know, the logic hurts) and go back to living her respectable little life in middle-of-nowhere England. I'm pretty confident that every Jane Austen novel ever has established that life wasn't that damn simple back then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward, bless his stupid little heart, refuses to jilt his spirited bride. He just soaks up all of the scandal with his name and title and goes to great lengths to appease her. But can he appease her with the love she really wants?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For all of its character flaws, the book is incredibly readable. BAVR was entertained the whole time, and that's a feat in itself. Warren writes a steamy love scene, and despite the fact that I think Claire will send Edward to an early grave, their chemistry is believable.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be honest, I'd rather wade in the sea of HR WTFery than read any contemporary or new adult romances at present, so At the Duke's Pleasure was sort of a treat. If Claire had been any less stupid, I may have rated it higher than 2.5 stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here's some good news for Warren: I'll be reading the next book in the series. Avon Soup is my favorite comfort food, after all. >:D\n",

      "All he had to do was touch her and she was lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And that about sums up this novel.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is so incredibly stagnant. For a majority, it's just push push push against the implacable wall that is Edward. However, there are absolutely NO stakes because, through him, the author has already made it expressly clear to both Claire and the reader that he isn't going to jilt her, not now, not ever. So, it's just one ridiculous stunt after the other with no real progress. I feel as though this, and the previous novel, would've been better suited to novellas rather than full-length novels. It's just so unnecessarily drawn out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author keeps telling me that Claire is interesting and unpredictable...but I found she really wasn't. I wasn't impressed by her antics because it didn't seem as though she was really trying. If she really wanted Edward to jilt her, she could've easily been found with another gentleman and have Edward and Society believe the worst. The author failed to show me what was so great about her and all I got was that she's boring and rather spineless. The above quote is a summary of Claire throughout this novel. She says she's determined...until he gives her a smile. More determination? Only until he touches or kisses her. Even MORE determination? Well, only until he takes it a bit further. She's such a waffler and her actions don't jive with the nonsense she spouts. The author did a terrible job of showing me determination. She didn't come off as determined to me -- she only came off as wishy-washy, particularly with her susceptibility to the magic stick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward? I didn't like him either. He's been avoiding his betrothal for ages and has no plans on actually following through with it...until he one day decides to. So...he's been doing what he wants for the two decades they've been betrothed (and the four years since she's been legal) and now he's finally decided to follow through?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the beginning, I had no strong emotions about him...until that flashback scene to when Claire was sixteen and overheard him speaking to Lady Bettis. I understand that Claire was too young for him (her sixteen to his twenty-seven), but it absolutely pissed me off that she overheard the conversation between them at sixteen. I wouldn't have minded so much if it had happened elsewhere, but I feel that it's in such bad taste for him to be flirting with Lady Bettis while simultaneously talking down about Claire...AT HER PARENTS' HOUSE PARTY. I understand he held no great affection towards Claire, but there's just something so absolutely vile and unsavoury about doing what Edward did, particularly because it was on Claire's HOME TURF. It pissed me off even more because that encounter eventually led to a short affair between Bettis and Edward. You just...you just don't shit-talk someone on their home turf. You just don't.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This could have been a favourite out of the series but I seriously did not like our heroine who kept doubting our hero and herself! She kept thinking how much he doesn't like her and how she's off to his mistress even after they get married. A little too low self esteem for me. ANYWAYS but the good parts. Were good. I loved her in the beginning because she was wacky and crazy, trying to shake him off so she can pursue a marriage with love and him just smirking and enjoying the ride. THE UNREQUITED LOVE WAS SO PERFECT. I felt pain in my chest when she/he confessed their doubts for each other. I also liked our hero who was jealous and clueless towards his emotions.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "3.5 stars\n",
      "\n",
      "Edward Duke of Clybourne is the eldest of the Bryon siblings and has finally decided to get married to his chosen bride since childhood, Claire Marsden. Claire has secretly been in love with Edward for years since she met her husband-to-be as a child. Unfortunately by the time Edward has decided to call upon her to get married, Claire is no longer interested, refusing to marry out of obligation and duty and wishing for something more, love.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a struggle to get through and mostly because of the overall dragged-out plot and the heroine's main reservations for marrying Edward. My biggest problem that I can’t wrap my brain around no matter how hard I try is the fact that Claire let one singular encounter she had with Edward when she was sixteen shape her entire decision and form her resolve on not marrying him. I thought it was ridiculous and incredibly lame. Now if it was some life-altering cruel incident then I could understand but this was just stupid. When she was sixteen, she overheard Edward telling a lady friend how he does not want to get married (at the time him being 27 years old) and Claire is just a child in his eyes (which is the truth). Her heart is broken and she quickly decides that she will never marry him cause he doesn’t love her.... and apparently never will. Cause g-d forbid the man had the nerve to not want to get married or love a girl he barely knows at the time which equates to him NEVER being able to love Claire. *crickets* The logic is so ass backwards and asinine that I don't understand why Warren chose this as the overall ‘conflict’ for the couple. Come on! Yes for a young girl it would make sense to be heartbroken but to use that ONE incident and let it shape her entire opinion of him (and it clearly did) and be dead set against marrying him years later because of it I thought was unreasonable and such a poor wishy washy justification to be honest. I was waiting for someone to clue in the poor girl that men DO change their minds and learn things as they get older. She clearly had a lot of growing up to do cause that was one of many things she had no notion of which I couldn't understand and found a little unrealistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to like Claire and understand her but she made it really hard through most of the book. To be blunt, for someone so naïve and innocent she’s a complete idiot. I lost all patience or understanding of her from the beginning when she devised this genius plan of hers to get out of her engagement. She was willing to do anything to get Edward to call off the engagement and I mean ANYTHING. Hence why I call her a naive idiot considering her last and final stunt almost had her raped. Her braziness and complete arrogance and carelessness to what she was doing and the obliviousness to the ramifications of it was just infuriating. Even for someone who's 22 and the eldest daughter she was incredibly clueless and naive about certain things she should know about IMO. I honestly kept looking forward to Edward chewing her out and scolding her like a child cause she was pretty much acting like one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus for someone who’s supposedly ‘in love’ and adores her betrothed I had a hard time seeing it or buying it between all the stupid outlandish stunts she kept pulling to try and get him to cry off through more than half of the book. It dragged on continuously to the point I was tempted to skip parts just to get to the end. I really wish Warren didn't drag all that out till eternity because it left very *little* room for me to believe she did want him or even truly loved him. She was so determined and stedfast on her decision through more than half of the book even while she was getting to know him as a man. That was infuriating to no end. She also seemed to make a lot of grand assumptions and misjudgments when it came to Edward, even when they were married. I understood her insecurity and fear but she needed to have a little more faith in the man she loves and not jump to quick conclusions and think immediately the worse. It's something I hate that authors do with heroines, especially shy insecure ones. They beat the insecurity part over the head repeatedly that it veers off into annoying rather then endearing. I thought here it was heaped on way too much. The constant redundant inner dialogues that would fill up pages of Claire dissecting every. little. thing he would or wouldn’t say, do or didn’t do drove me up the wall. She loved to blow things way out of proportion and stack every little thing against him. RME. If you have fears TALK TO HIM, if you have reservations talk to him don't assume the worst every single time. Clearly you have a mouth, say something and stop being a giant boob.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason I managed to get through it was because of Edward and his colorful lovely family. I loved Edward, loved seeing him handle his family and work all with great ease and confidence and authority. I really enjoyed seeing him interact with his siblings and mother. The family dynamic is one of the reasons why I love this series so much. Edward is a very straight-forward, honest loyal-to-a-fault kind of man which I loved. When he wants something he sets his mind on it and goes after it, full throttle. :P I admired that and it's safe to say he made me melt more than once. He was so charming and sweet and delicious. It just had me wishing more than once that the heroine was better suited for him. Given Claire's over-the-top silly antics I struggled accepting her as his match. But either way, after they did get married they had some pretty sweet tender moments that I enjoyed. I have to say the love scenes in particular were pretty steamy and intimate and playful which I really liked. It's one of the reasons why I love TAW's writing she gives everything even when it comes to love scenes and intimate moments. Very descriptive and just really enthralling. The honeymoon scenes are the highlight of the book for me.\n",

      "This would have been a 4 star or even 5 if it wasn't for Claire's antics and dragging out of a shallow redundant plot.\n",

      "➳For such feisty & very dominating female I couldn’t believe how much of sheltered life that Ava seem to have lived, or how innocent & naïve she was. at time it got kinda ignoring.

      "Fantastic bodyguard shifter romance... 4.5 stars!\n",
      "\n",
      "This book had two of my favorite tropes wonderfully blended into a brilliant novel I didn't want to stop reading. The angst, longing, and sexual tension in this story was top-notch, and I absolutely loved every word of this book. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this novel by Jodi, and I will definitely read more by her ♡\n",

      "3.5 stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a long while since I last read a really good shifter book so after reading the blurb and reviews I thought I'd give this a try and it turned out to be an entertaining read.\n",
      "Damon Trahan is a Werewolf Guardian, all he wants is to do his job well and belong to a pack.\n",
      "He's on a mission when an urgent call comes through, a female werewolf has been kidnapped and he's to rescue her at all costs.\n",
      "Ava Renfroe is the female in question, she's been drugged and kidnapped and thinks she's hallucinating when she sees men change into wolves. She's twenty-four, has never shifted and has no idea she's a wolf.\n",
      "There's some great characters here, Damon, Ava, Jayden, Jeff but especially Granny she's hilarious.\n",
      "On the whole this is a good book, it's a bit abrupt in places and I got a little fed up of all the 'I'm not worthy' but there was only one part I really didn't understand and I'm putting it as a spoiler.\n",

      "Damon and Ava\n",
      "\n",
      "Damon is a Guardian with the Arkansas wolf pack. When Ava is kidnapped by the red wolves, Damon goes to her rescue. We later find out Ava is of royal lineage. According to pack law, she is suppose to mate with a male of royal lineage. In this instance that royal male would be the Pack Master, Barrett. Ava wants only Damon for her mate. Damon is an orphan and therefore unqualified to be her mate. This doesn't stop them from wanting each other. Will Ava and Damon be able to resist each other? Are the red wolves threat to Ava and other female werewolves resolved?\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a good read, but not the best. There were times when I wanted to smack both Damon and Ava. The angst between them was a bit repetitive. The plot was simple and the subplots all tied up nicely. I liked the ending. There is explicit sex and adult language in this novel.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I picked this up after realizing that Gaiman's Snow, Glass, Apples was not a book but a quite short story (why do some short stories get independent listings and others not?). That turned out to be a quite dark re-envisioning of Snow White. It was good but not superb; given the length too much space was given to unimportant details.\n",
      "\n",
      "My very favorite story in the collection was Garth Nix's \"Infestation,\" a very original and science-fictiony explanation of vampirism.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were a couple stories that, although quite good, seem to get published in numerous vampire anthologies. Anne Rice and Jane Yolen, I'm looking at you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some moderately good entries from Sergei Lukyanenko, Nancy Kilpatrick, Barbara Hambly, Cailin Kiernan, Joe Hill. John Langan's story was interesting plotwise although the writing wasn't very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's not to say his writing was the worst -- there were many worse prose stylists (seriously, how is LA Banks so successful? That was awful), but I skipped them. I skipped quite a few, actually, and some others I didn't enjoy. My rating reflects that rather than the quality of the stories I singled out for mention.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I'm not going to lie, I really really want to read this because the cover references my all-time FAVORITE vampire movie.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This thing is an enormous tome! I don't know if it has been released in hardback or not, but if it has, that version has to be anchor-worthy. I requested it from the library because Elizabeth Bear and Sarah Monette had stories in it, and I'll read pretty much anything either of those worthies publish. I didn't expect to care for most of the rest, and didn't plan to do much more than flip through them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it happens, I read most of the other stories, and there were many surprises. I did skip some of the reprints, such as the Anne Rice story (I wouldn't have read it the first time it was published, and I wasn't about to read it simply because she was in good company now). I had read Carrie Vaughn's \"Life Is the Teacher\" before, but for some reason my eyes just fell into reading it again, and I felt well rewarded for doing so. On the other hand, while I had enjoyed \"Twilight\" by Kelley Armstrong the first time I read it a few years back, I wasn't moved to repeat the experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe my favorite story may have been \"Finders, Keepers\" by L.A. Banks, as I still remember it clearly and with pleasure. I've only read one of Banks' Vampire Huntress novels and didn't find it interesting at all, so I haven't read any more of her work, but I may seek out more of her short fiction in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mama Gone\" by Jane Yolen felt fresh, as Yolen's work so often does. Garth Nix's contribution, \"Infestation,\" was a little bit predictable, but that may be due to overexposure to the genre.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found myself returning to the cover art by David Palumbo again and again, intrigued by the fascinating faces he gave the figures there. They aren't classically alluring, and most aren't hideous—most would look perfectly at home on any street. But they also have that, that something, an element you can't quite put your finger on, an element of the other. Take a look and I believe you'll see what I mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have fun!\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I could say I have been hungry for short stories but I didn’t know it until I saw the fat book sitting there on the shelf, as if waiting for me. The cover promised rich short stories by writers like Stephen King, Neil Gaiman, Joe Hill, Tad Williams, Anne Rice and many more, just perfect for sinking my teeth into on my commute to and from work.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must confess that I have a soft spot for horror stories, and vampire tales fit into that category nicely. Taking the book from the shelf and leafing through only emphasized my desire to take it home and start eating. I mean reading, of course, reading.\n",
      "It was good, quite good, better than I expected. The risk with buying a short story collection is that you may like some stories but you may also dislike others, and while for me the balance usually makes it worth buying the book, this time I can’t complain at all. Blood drips from every story, sometimes it’s a little and sometimes it’s whole buckets, and what I liked even more is that some of the stories go that extra step into the horrific. One that comes to mind is Joe Hill’s \"Abraham’s Boys\" which I read around 7 o’clock on a beautiful morning on my way to work – I remember distinctly the sun coming through the taxi window on my left, and so bright it made me wish I hadn’t forgotten my sunglasses at home – nevertheless, the end of that story put an icy shiver through me and I’m glad I read it in full daylight. I remember Joe Hill’s \"Heart Shaped Box\" which I read a couple of years ago and while I enjoyed it, this short story was far better, or to be more in sync with the vampire vocabulary, it was horrifyingly good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neil Gaiman’s \"Snow, Glass, Apples\" was another story I particularly enjoyed. The classic Snow White fairytale gets a revamp (pun intended) and while reading it I was pleasantly surprised to see how the author had managed to stick to many of the original details and also incorporate vampire-related elements to make the story truly unique and also quite creepy. Let’s just say I like the stepmother this time around, and not the beautiful princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the stories I’ve read before - Stephen King’s \"One for the Road\" where the weather combined with the vampire threat makes for quite a chilling combo and \"The Master of Rampling Gate\" by Anne Rice, a story about an inherited old house and an apparently odd request for it to be torn down.\n",
      "One of the most intriguing stories was \"The Vechi Barbat\" by Nancy Kilpatrick, which brings into focus a Romanian girl whose tale about the ancient man who lived in her village reminded me of home. It was a bit disconcerting to turn the page and see words in my native language mixed into an English book like some strange exotic blood used to enhance this feast of stories. But perhaps the oddest tale was \"Exsanguinations: A Handbook for the Educated Vampire\" by Anna S. Oppenhagen-Petrescu (translated from the Romanian by Catherynne M. Valente) which is written in the form of a journal/biography and in such a way that it made me wonder if it wasn’t real. Then again, it is a book about vampires and they have been known to play with people’s minds as well as sucking their blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed this book a lot – the different types of vampires and the little introductory notes at the beginning of each story made for a varied combination perfectly designed to satisfy every appetite: from the fragile beautiful sexy female vampire, to the merciful horrible shape tamed by the sound of human voices telling stories around the fire, to the brutal killing machine whose only desire is to feed; ancient tales mingle with science, brutality with ethereal beauty, immortality with the vulnerability of the moment, and on top of it all, love, desire and lots of blood, not necessarily in that order. And I’m still hungry.\n",

      "Stolen by a Billionaire started off a little slow for me. I had to listen to half of the book before I could finally get into it. Kamani played his role as the villain exceptionally. That man was TRASH. There are not enough adjectives in the dictionary to describe how horrible he was. What really annoys me is, Kamani didn’t even get his. We have to wait until book two for his dirt to finally be exposed. One thing Ananias Duke doesn’t play about is his money. Playing with his money is like playing with your life. Kamani’s dumb azz had to find that out the hard way trying to be slick. Urvi was already looking at her husband sideways after she had to bail him out of a gambling debt but, her blinders finally come off during her captivity and she starts to see Kamani for who he really is. There were a lot of moving parts to this story but, it definitely keeps you entertained. Benjamin Charles and Leon Nixon did a great job narrating but, I wanted to fight Morae Brehon for that ridiculous accent. The accent ruined a good portion of the book for me. It was exaggerated, over the top, and unnecessary. Who told her she needed to speak with a southern accent just because the book is set in Atlanta?!!! As someone who lives in the South, I was highly offended at her caricature attempt at a southern accent. Insert strong side eye here. 😒😒😒 In the end, I enjoyed Stolen by a Billionaire.

      "Kamani is a Governor with more secrets than I could count. He feels that he is above everyone but he is not prepared for what happens when he tries to cross Duke. It’s like Kamani didn’t take anything serious. It was all about greed and money. Like, your wife is kidnapped and you’re not painting the city red?!? Smh!!\n",

      "Urvi was too good of a woman for Kamani and she handled being kidnapped better than I thought she would. The sexual tension between Urvi and Duke was so intense; they wanted each other in the worst way. Duke is definitely that man!! Whew! He is the ultimate alpha male and he does not play! But, I felt like Duke spared Kamani two times too many. Kamani didn’t respect Duke, at all.\n",

      "Whew there were some turning tables in this one. Kamani was hot trash and he knew it. He had the nerve to be the governor and was constantly doing the most disrespectful ish. Putting himself and his wife Urvi in harms way. He found himself indebted to Duke and even when he had chances to make things right, he chose not to. Duke decided to take the situation into his hands and captured Urvi to give Kamani a wake up call. The griminess really kept showing in Kamani as he made up lie after lie. It didn't seem like he truly valued her at all and I was sick of him. He was greedy and all he cared about was finding ways to get way more money than he needed, rather than trying to get his wife back.\n",
      "In the meantime, time is passing and Urvi is somehow getting closer to Duke. He treats her like a queen even as his captor. He was attracted to her, prior to actually getting to know her and once he experienced how feisty and headstrong she was it was a wrap. He tries not to take their relationship to the next level, but it feels inevitable. She has him breaking his own rules and he ultimately doesn't want to let her go, but feels he can't give her what he deserves. I'm eager to see how this pans out.\n",

      "When Victoria first meets Saber, she doesn't believe that he is a true prince planning on taking back his kingdom that was stolen away from his family. Victoria is now a governess and meets Saber again after three years of distance but her feelings for him haven't changed. Saber can't afford for his plans or his true identity to be revealed while he is planning the revolution so he takes Victoria prisoner in his castle and where some of his people are taking refuge. Victoria is the one woman that says 'no' to Saber and isn't afraid of standing up to his family or to him for that matter, and her beauty has always held him captive and is earnest in his desire for her, and even though he knows that love was beaten out of him, he wants Victoria in his life...forever. Taken By The Prince by Christina Dodd is the ninth installment in the governess series. The moment I saw the cover and the blurb I couldn't resist reading it. It was the first unread book to be read on my Nook and I just loved every moment of it and couldn't stop reading, it kept me so enthralled from beginning to end. I found Victoria to be easy to relate with, tough but still has a gentle spirit, one who is full of courage and passion. Saber is utterly irresistable, rough exterior but needs love more than any other because he hasn't had much of it and has lost much in his young life. I was completely charmed with this love story that can just make you melt yet cheer for these two.....a well worth read, and one I plan on reading again for sure!!!! A Keeper!!!\n",

      "Taken By The Prince tells the story of a renegade prince Saber Lawrence, who wishes to gain control of his country Moricadia. He faces many obstacles in the way of his mission and fights many demons of his own. Including not falling in love with one Miss Victoria Cardiff, the girl he once saw during her very young age and who now is proving to be a very principled and beautiful obstacle in his expedition. Therefore, conditions force him to kidnap her in order to keep her mouth shut so that he can carry on with his mission. But sparks fly when Victoria proves to be a surprise for this bold hero and hence we get to read a beautiful romance story with some acceptable twists!\n",
      "\n",
      "The spirit and vibrancy of young Saber in the first part of the book was enticing and admirable. We get to know and understand what kind of man he will be. His purpose to rescue his people and his approach to understand and accept Victoria was fundamentally portrayed in the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saber happens to be a self-assured driven hero, capable enough to direct his people and Victoria. Victoria is a heroine who knows to hold her own ground and therefore earned worthy respect from both Saber and the people. She is a strong woman who was a perfect match in every turn with the proud alpha male that Saber was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saber was in complete control of his plans and emotions and had determined eyes on target until he came along to know Victoria. She changed his portrait of future. Victor was completely off-blown after encountering the present stabilized grown-up version of Victoria who was very much different from the timid awkward young lady that he have known from past. She bested him at every turn and turned down his offer of being his mistress with a BANG! She was the perfect heroine for the enigmatic and supremely confident Victor. But like any true alpha hero, his arrogant high-handed behavior back-fired at times in case of wining his lady love. Which is why he might have to do his fair share of groveling in the end, otherwise, there is simply no happy ending for him and his heroine!\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved the story. It was all about a courageous alpha hero, a dauntless gallant heroin, a dynamic and vigorous plot, a blistering sensuality and assortment of cynical humor. There were impressive secondary characters and a beautiful description of the landscape and background of the setting which is bound to help the readers be ‘taken’ by the book and make the whole reading experience existent.\n",

      "The island fishing village of Eastport, Maine, has plenty of salty local character. It also has a sweet side, thanks to Jacobia “Jake” Tiptree, her best friend Ellie, and their waterfront bake shop, The Chocolate Moose. But when island life is disrupted by the occasional killer, Jake and Ellie put their chocolate treats aside to make sure justice is served.\n",

      "This summer, Eastport’s favorite lovebirds, kindergarten teacher Sharon Sweetwater and Coast Guard Captain Andy Devine, are getting married. The gala reception is sure to be the fête of the season, especially with a wedding-cake-sized whoopie pie courtesy of The Chocolate Moose. For Jake and Ellie, the custom-ordered confection will finally reel in some much-needed profits. But the celebratory air, and sweet smell of success, are ruined by foul murder.\n",

      "Let me start by saying I rate my cozy mysteries different than all other genres of books I read. I still use a five star rating system (or with cozies I like to think instead of stars how many cups of coffee/tea.….which is my idea of cozy). The following is how I rate my cozies:\n",
      "1 cup of coffee- did not finish or will not continue on in series.\n",
      "2 cups of coffee- this book has potential, but on the fence about whether I will read the next book.\n",

      "1.) There called cozies for a reason, and that being said I know they are not for everybody. I love them!! Therefore the first thing I think about is how cozy are they?

It made me feel somewhat better that Ellie was positive that this \"whoopie pie\" wedding cake we were making was going to put us back on track. Then Toby (the resident bad boy) is found poisoned. Did I mention that he is the ex-boyfriend to the bride were making the whoopie pie for?....and with a milkshake that looks to be from the shop?!? Then later a 2nd murder....Oh yes...things were really getting fudgy.\n",
      "The list of suspects was longer than the ingredients that go into making the perfect malted milkshake...including Ellie's secret addition.

The mystery kept me guessing until the very end...well done Sarah Graves!\n",

They get a job for a wedding cake that will help them out, but when there is a murder in town, the groom and then the bride are arrested for the murder. If the girls can not free them, all the money they spent on ingredients will be lost. As well, it appears that the murder weapon was a poison laced milkshake from the Chocolate Moose. The girls need to clear their friends as well as their business.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the things I enjoy about this series is that the characters are quite real to me. Running a business is tough and they need to pinch pennies and work hard for every cent. They are both happily married, so there is no romance of love triangles. Ellie's husband has had to travel for a job and left her and their daughter home. This is a difficult situation, and they are considering having to move. Bob Arnold, the local police chief is always incredibly patient with their snooping. He never threatened to toss them in jail, but he seemed genuinely concerned for their well-being. Set in a small town, this is somewhat believable, but we all know police want to solve their own crimes. Finally, there is Jake's dad. He is a feisty, aging hippie who is recovering from a recent heart attack. He wants to be independent and does not want to be babied. He bought himself a new truck and zips around town sticking his nose into other's business. He is a hoot and I hope I am like him when I get to that age. The pace of this story varies. There are some slow spots, but overall it is a good story, with some tense and exciting times. I did not figure out the killer until the reveal, so that always makes a good mystery for me. I listened to the audiobook and enjoyed the narration of this story. I have come to enjoy Susan Boyce's voice when reading cozies and will listen to more that she narrates.\n",

      "So you have been a Catholic your whole life. Maybe even went to Catholic School. But through college and out in your job you feel like you are surrounded by Bible thumping Christians who have taken as their personal crusade to convert their heathen brother. That is you.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you do? You know that they are great people. Very sincere in their faith. And seemingly very strong Christians. They love God, Jesus His Son and the Holy Spirit. In fact they are consumed by it and frankly it is a little bit attractive at times. Especially since you might be a luke-warm Catholic at best.\n",

      "But something is nagging you. It's maybe your mom's voice in the back of your head that she raised you a particular way. Or maybe it's that you would really miss those beautifully lit Midnight Masses.

      "Keating delves into all the misconceptions about Catholicism. Especially all the shoddy history that has been written by so-called \"ex-priests\" who have an axe to grind. \"C&F\" will cover all the bases. It grabs ahold of nearly all the main attacks that Catholicism has undergone from fundamentalists who constantly barrage the Catholic Church as the \"Whore of Babylon\" referenced in Revelations. Keating is thorough in his defense and lays open the faultiness of their arguments as well as how nearly every reference that a fundamentalist will use as being flawed in its presentation of what Catholicism really is. Most of their references are flat out lies and misrepresentations.\n",
      "\n",
      "A warning though. You will want to savor this book. In fact it will be impossible to tear through it in only a few days. I read it methodically--maybe a chapter or 2 a night and that was it! I had to if I wanted to wrap my mind around on everything he was saying, and reflect fully on it. Trust me--it's like weight-training for your faith. You will need to train slowly, with deliberate technique in your reflection.\n",

      "Read this quite a few years ago so I hesitate to write a review with my poor memory. However, with that caveat, I recall that I found the book useful and I learned a lot. Prior to reading this, I didn't know that the average poorly catechized Catholic was targeted by \"Bible Christians\". At the time I was reading this book, I was heavily involved in homeschooling my children so my primary response to this book was to work harder on Scripture studies with them so they would be less vulnerable.\n",

      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Back in the 1980s, young Catholics were leaving the Church at a tremendous rate in order to join Evangelical Christian congregations that literally thrived on these conversions. Some denominations, such as the Assemblies of God, have congregations today comprised of some 80% or more ex-Catholics. Why did Catholics leave the Church at such an alarming rate in those days? Part of it was poor catechesis on the part of the Catholic Church in the 1960s and 70s, which resulted in an entire generation of Catholics who don't understand their own faith. And part of the reason for these conversions was the purposeful targeting of Catholics by these Evangelical denominations, and these marketing campaigns often consisted of misleading or downright slanderous accusations of Catholic beliefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1988 Karl Keating wrote \"Catholicism and Fundamentalism\" as a response to this exodus. On the one hand, it highlights the Evangelical organizations that target Catholics and try to persuade them to leave the Church. But the main thrust of this book is to discuss the Catholic faith, to catechize the uncatechized Catholics who are inclined to leave, and to present the faith to Evangelicals who have been taught to believe that the Catholic Church is the Whore of Babylon, the Anti-Christ of today. In this effort this book is a great success. It is a very readable presentation of the faith, and it answers many of the most common objections to the faith in a very readable and enjoyable way. It is very easy to read and in places hard to put down. In this sense, I would recommend this book to people who either do not understand the Catholic faith or who have wrong ideas about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, this book is very dated in a lot of ways. Keating spends much of the first half of the book discussing and repudiating the major Evangelical organizations of the 1980s who targeted Catholics. Today, very few of these organizations still exist, and those who do still exist are irrelevant. In the 21st Century, the threat posed to Catholics by Evangelicals is minimal. The major threat to the faith today stands squarely in the secular realm. Catholics today are not leaving the Church to be Evangelicals or even to join the mainline Protestant denominations. They are leaving the Church to join the world, take up the sexual revolution, accept social teachings that are opposed to the teachings of the Church, or simply to live a narcissistic life. To this end, this work should be updated to examine the major reasons why young Catholics either leave the Church or no longer practice the faith. So, while \"Catholicism and Fundamentalism\" may be a nice historical interest into why Catholics used to leave the faith, it is hardly relevant in explaining why young Catholics today leave the Church.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of its shortcomings, I would highly recommend that anyone read \"Catholicism and Fundamentalism\" who is interested in the Catholic Faith and its defense.\n",

      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "There is no other horror novel quite like this one. Its notoriety and reputation--its esteem and admiration--are fully well-earned. It was conceived at the dawn of the horror-fiction revolution stirred awake by Stephen King; during that long 'lull' before the genre exploded and multi-millions began to be tossed around. Ambitious mass-market authors at that time, were not really throwing all their energies into this genre because it was considered a 'sleepy backwater'. A special-interest genre. Ira Levin (of all people) was leading the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then John Farris comes along and--via this one book--showed that a horror novel could stand on its own; be fully-fledged; could exhibit robustness, could obey all the principles of modern mainstream dramatic fiction. He was ahead of his time; he was a pioneer and a forerunner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strengths of his conception here, are many. First, 'All Heads' is a rich example of 'Southern Gothic' writing --and a very fine one at that. Much of it can be read--and marveled at--for just this aspect alone. It's a moody, atmospheric, crazy family saga combined with a sexually-realistic romantic storyline as well. Not an easy feat to pull off. Good Southern gothic is famously hard to arrive at 'correctly'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next: as a horror novel, 'Heads' is wildly creative and penetrating; psychological; unorthodox (spanning multiple continents? you don't see that too often, in horror yarns) as well as that convincing romance I'm mentioning (one meets even less frequently). The length and breadth of time Farris spends on description... conveying gorgeous Southern landscape, meticulous details of character, local histories, personal backgrounds, 'shared past' events...there's inventiveness in every quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next: the technical traits of Farris' writing style. You will need a thesaurus handy to accompany this read. It is dense, literate, weighty--this is challenging literature which has to be slowly sifted through and pored over. What Farris demonstrates by this is that horror novels don't have to written crudely, simplistically, or childishly (as they mostly were being written at the time and often continue to be written, today). This is a mature work penned from a mature sensibility; it's not 'kiddie horror'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you catch the import of my comments so far? Folks, this is a full-blown novel. Morally ambiguous characters, fully-grounded motivations and genuine emotions; characters with unclear destinies; alternating perspectives. This is the kind of intimacy and delicacy that Stephen King usually abandoned in favour of faster-moving, more-sensational plots (and his famous 'commercial cues').\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's talk straight: Stephen King succumbed to authorial flaws more often than not as his career bloomed. Besides his endlessly thin, repetitive characters..he also quickly began to write in extremely predictable, derivative cycles. Always borrowing from his horror predecessors --in some way or other--for his source ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though I'd love to be able to say that John Farris did not also fall prey to this, unfortunately he did. If Farris had only written one more book as unique as 'All Heads'; he would be a grandmaster of horror. But unfortunately--as it turned out--this specific tale is the only kind of work he can pen. All his books afterwards borrow from the format he first coined here. He's a proverbial one-trick pony.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farris' fatal flaw is that he doesn't lift from other writers [as King does]: sadly, he re-uses material Right from this very title. The rest of his novels are wash-rinse-repeat: 'Orestian family sagas' just as this one is. This sole book is the primary model for all his later narratives. This is his only watershed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas Stephen King--for all his failings--always gave us something unusual and fresh in every story premise But title after title--he wasn't limited to just one, lone, stupendous creative outburst. Farris was. And that's why you've never heard about Farris. He came up with 'The Fury', too--which received a fair movie adaptation--but it just wasn't enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: in any pound-for-pound \"book matchup\" you can take any single title of King, Levin, Straub, Campbell, or Barker--arrange any one-on-one comparison you wish--none of them will match the audacity, ingenuity, and execution of 'All Heads Turn'. Not 'The Shining'; not 'Ghost Story', not 'Rosemary's Baby'--nothing out there in its class--can compete. Where Farris stumbles--where his career falters--is when you compare him to his peers on criteria like 'output-over-time'. He has no durability, no sustainability. Nonetheless, 'Heads' is perhaps the single-best, standalone, 'graphic' horror novel, ever. Certainly the best in its particular style. And that feat is well deserving of all our constant and renewed admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look here. If all I've said up above doesn't convince you--then, forget everything I've stated--and let's make it just this: your hands will tremble; your breath will get short, your heart will race; and you will gulp and swallow on a cotton-dry mouth. You will have to leap out of your seat and pace around the room to calm yourself down. It is that crazy, that unsettling, that disturbing.\n",

It is well written and the story is beautifully told. I recommend the STORY highly for any fan of old-school horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the formatting problems in this book seriously interfered with my enjoyment of the story.

      "All Heads Turn... is my first exposure to John Farris's work. I've seen his books on the horror shelves for many years and I have no clue why I haven't busted one open before now. Maybe, it was because I never really knew any Farris fans in my horror circles. Either way, All Heads Turn When the Hunt Goes By remedied that. I am now a fan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The title is a curious one and, for the life of me, I have no idea why the book is named that, even after reading it. That mystery aside, Farris crafts a southern gothic piece that is laminated in rich and vibrant layer after layer. His style reminds me of a cross between Peter Straub and Stephen King, which seems fitting. King claims that Farris is one of his early influences and his hey day was right along King's in the 1970s and 80s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our story begins in 1942 with two different settings - Champ, one of three sons of a Virginia plantation owner, recollects that horrible day when his brother, Clipper, was getting married in his dress blues to his high school sweetheart. In a fit of unprovoked rage, Clipper takes his ceremonial sword and stabs it through his bride-to-be's throat. Not done yet, he then jumps down from the altar and lops off his father's head before turning the saber on himself and ramming it down his gullet. Meanwhile, in England, what appears to be a mysterious bomb explosion that turns the shrubbery dead and brown kills a man named Dr. Holley. Dr Holley has an unusual history that goes back to the deep, dark jungles of Africa. What comes out of that jungle was a shell of the original Dr. Holley.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two threads twist and turn and eventually lead into one another. Along the way, Farris crafts a tale shrouded in mystery and the macabre with layers that don't give up their secrets easily. I've heard some say that the story was dry. For me, it was a nice, slow burn that was common with other writers of the era, particularly Charles L. Grant. The ending did seem like a rushed bunch of snippets that felt more hurried than speeding up the pace. It didn't diminish my enjoyment of All Heads Turn...and I look forward to taking the next dusty Farris tome that has been sitting for far too long on the shelf.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "All Heads Turn When the Hunt Goes By is in dire need of a physical reprint! (From what I hear the e-book is littered with lazy formatting issues.) Switching back and forth between the conventions and dressings of a southern family gothic and a tale of post colonial horror, Farris' novel of 1977 was a notorious experiment in form then but is mostly forgotten now. What it is still is a singular experience in the genre: unorthodox plotting, jarring transitions in tone, byzantine approach to backstory and surprising splashes of carnage and carnality. At times the prose can call to mind the command of language found in the more lucid writings of John Hawkes. The blunt racism of several characters will discomfort some readers, but such unpleasantness is a motif of the novel and not a prescription. And besides, it's not every day that a novel begins with a written account of a wedding as plush as a pageant that is cut short by a mannered bloodbath, and then climaxes feverishly with several possessions and an inept raid on a voodoo ritual. If I were to ever orchestrate a multi-million dollar heist and then double cross my fellow confederates in crime by fleeing in a time machine to the late 70's, then this is the horror novel that I would use my illicit gains to adapt into an arthouse flick.\n",

Abby can’t believe her aunt would be a murderer so she vows to do what she can to find the real killer.\n",

With all the likable secondary characters in this opener I’m more than curious where the series will head next.\n",

      "Abbey McRee is recently divorced and starting her life all over again. She recently inherited her Aunt Sybil's victorian style home in Snowberry Creek. She moves in with her dog, Zeke. Along with the house, she also inherited her aunt's quilting group, a spot on the local senior affairs committee and a tenant, Tripp Blackston. When an enemy of her aunt's is discovered dead and buried under junk in a corner of the yard, suspicion falls on her deceased aunt and Tripp. Abbey is determined to clear her aunt's name and identify the murderer. It proves to be a dangerous quest!\n",

      "All in all, a nice start to a new cozy series. The premise of inheriting a victorian home from an elderly relative is pretty tropey, but the story was still a fun read. I like Abbey as a main character. She's trying hard to start her life over after a failed marriage and endures the snarkiness of small town busybodies. Her pet mastiff, Zeke, is a great addition to the story as is her renter, Tripp and the rest of the side characters. The quirky members of the quilting group jump in to help Abbey investigate. Nothing like a feisty group of senior citizens to help ferret out a killer. The ending wasn't really a surprise, but there was enough twists, suspects and surprises in this book to keep my attention. I will definitely read more of this series.\n",

      "Dollycas’s Thoughts\n",
      "\n",
      "Abby McCree hasn’t spent much time in Snowberry Creek, Washington of late but she remembers all the good times she had with her Aunt Sybil as a child. She especially remembers a quilt they were working on. Aunt Sybil finished it by herself as Abby’s visits became shorter and less frequent. Now her aunt has passed away and left her home to Abby and her aunt’s friends have already volunteered her to take over some of the committees Sybil was leading including the quilting guild.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her aunt also left her a couple of other surprises. a bull mastiff named Zeke and a cantankerous but very easy on the eyes tenant named Tripp Blackston. Abby also uncovers another surprise among the blueberries, Dolly Cayhill’s body. Dolly was a snowbird who usually takes flight during the winter months, so sadly no one even knew the woman was unaccounted for. Dolly and Sybil were rivals in almost everything they did. Finding her body in Sybil’s yard wrapped in one of Sybil’s quilts lands Sybil square at the top of the suspect list. Abby believes there is no way her aunt could have committed such a heinous crime but the rumors are flying and evidence is stacking up. Is there any way to clear her aunt’s good name? There may be if she can live long enough to stitch all the clues together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like Abby McCree, but she needs to learn to say no! Those elderly ladies really ran roughshod over her. By the end of the story, she was getting her bearings and getting stronger, which I was very happy to see. Those ladies reminded me so much of some of the older ladies I have known in my life. A little pushy, but with huge hearts and kind souls. Tripp Blackstone, on the other hand, was a tough nut to crack, ex-military tough, and a little closed off. He starts to soften as he finds himself in the role of protector to Abby as digs into Dolly’s death and right into the line of fire. Tripp and Abby grow a lot for this being the first book in the series. I liked the way the author has started them on their journey. My favorite character of all was Zeke. A big dog who is a gentle giant, at least most of the time. The only time he leaves Abby’s side is when he is with Tripp. He is truly my kind of canine, even with all the drool 🙂\n",
      "\n",
      "The plot was complex with two real mysteries. The first, the murder, had its share of suspects, but one after another are eliminated and Abby becomes a target. The second deals with 13 missing quilts the quilt had hoped to use for a calendar fundraiser. Given to a new member to photograph who then abruptly leaves town without returning the quilts or the pictures to the guild. As the new president of the guild, Abby tries her best to locate them. I used to love to quilt so this subplot really interested me. The two mysteries mesh together so well. The story had some really exciting events and I was on the edge of my seat for the nail-biting ending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Morgan has taken the time to fully describe each person and place so clearly that I could picture every element of the story. The people came alive. Abby’s home, the yard, the garage, and all the places around town were easily pictured in my mind. I was in each moment right along with Abby.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I love most about this story was that it is written for the long haul of a series. The main characters evolved a great deal in this book but there is still so much to know about them. I am definitely invested in their lives and want to know more about them. The secondary characters are fun and entertaining too and have plenty of room to grow.\n",

      "The beginning of the Abby McCree series by an author I haven't read before. Abby life is changed by two events, a divorce and inheriting as home in Snowberry Creek, Washington. She also inherits a Mastiff, Zeke, and a tenant, in the caretaker's cottage. Abby has agreed to finish her Aunt Sybil's term as President of the quilting guild. Abby is adjusting to a new life when her tenant, Tripp and she began to clear a blackberry patch and finds the body of her Aunt's biggest competitor. The tale makes many changes as Abby and Tripp began to unravel Aunt Sybil's affairs. The villain is easy to recognize. I am looking forward to reading the next book. I highly recommend this book.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "After inheriting a rundown estate from her late Aunt Sybil, Abby McCree settles into life in the tiny town of Snowberry Creek. Though really, there’s no time to settle. Aunt Sybil had many obligations, and now Abby’s expected to carry the mantle. Soon she’s taking the reins of the local quilting guild, serving on the city’s Senior Affairs group, and planning garage sales. But then her tenant, Tripp, discover a body buried in her backyard— and it’s Aunt Sybil’s fierce archrival. As all signs point to Sybil as the murderer, Abby becomes focused on finding the real killer and clearing her aunt’s name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Author Alexis Morgan has woven an irresistible plot. Abby, making a new beginning after a nasty divorce and the death of her aunt, is immediately embroiled in a murder mystery without obvious answers. The murder was obviously personal— the body was wrapped in one of Sybil’s handmade quilts. And the idea of having the body found near Abby’s house leads to some thick tension. There’s a constant need to have the murder solved, not just because Sybil’s name is being sullied, but because Abby is in ever-increasing danger. This builds slowly over the course of the book, leading to a fairly explosive ending. It’s very effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, the reason it truly works comes down to the character of Abby McCree. She’s strong, smart, and determined. While some cozies have the main character bumble through the investigation, she carefully plots her actions without putting herself in unnecessary danger. Abby is such a realistic character that she keeps the story grounded, allowing for some zany moments that feel quirky rather than like caricature. Her journey might have quiet moments, but it’s never boring.\n",
      "\n",
      "It helps that the mystery is intricately woven. There are some solid suspects, a tricky red herring or two, and plenty of twists to leave couch sleuths guessing. While Abby never really considers her aunt a suspect, Morgan provides enough evidence to create doubt for the reader. This little bit of plotting is brilliant enough to make all evidence questionable, even when it appears obvious.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, beyond the puzzle itself, a great cozy mystery is made or broken with its cast of secondary characters and, fortunately, author Morgan has populated Snowberry Creek with some wonderful denizens. The quilting guild is a particular highlight, especially as the women develop excuses to be near windows with a view of Tripp doing yardwork. Tripp, though sometimes gruff and bossy, works as a romantic interest and foil for Abby. Morgan deserves kudos for writing a complex partner— someone who obviously needs to work on expressing his emotions, but with enough tenderness to get the big moments ‘right’.\n",
      "\n",
      "Death by Committee has a fantastic heroine, a splash of humor, and a wonderfully crafted mystery. It’s a bit like the many quilts described in its pages— stitched together beautifully.\n",

You will be introduced to charming and lovable characters that entertain the reader through the twists and turns of each mystery, not easily solved. The heroine of this story is named Caitlyn Le Fey. After her mom passed away, she discovered that she was actually adopted after having been abandoned on the side of the road near Tillyhenge, a tiny English village. Caitlyn goes to Tillehenge, where her life changes dramatically. She lives in a room above a chocolate shop.\n",

Caitlyn follows clues down different paths until she is sure she has discovered the culprit. Is she right?

      "This book actually does list various valid sources. Great voice from the author too. My dislike comes from including some forms of income that while legal aren't very ethical. For example, passing off freelancers work as your own by basically reselling. I don't have a problem with people reselling products like water bottles that you stick your brand on or something. I do think it's not okay to resell someone's writing or design they created for your client as your own. If you had an entire design team you used for clients within a company you own, is a little different than getting an order from someone then finding a cheap freelancer on Fiverr to present to them at 5 times what you paid. It's legal, just not very a cool and hints at deceptive practice. Market yourself as a freelancer manager or something instead.\n",

      "This book was so readable,so easy to follow, and so packed with little extras that alone would be worth the price of the book! Another thing that’s really cool about it is that you can see some of the lessons she discusses in action throughout the book. The book was so useful that I almost didn’t review it, because anyone who reads it will become qualified competition in the future competitive open market, especially on Amazon! Please note that Gundi promotes a style of marketing yourself by using your community, a “you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours!” approach that I have seen make even the newest kid on the block a celebrity over night, when you focus on following these steps as they are laid out for you, growth and prosperity in turn are the results. One thing to keep in mind is that “nothing comes easy, and nothing in life is free”. In other words, there are no lessons in this book that don’t require some diligent work before those benefits come, and it also “takes money, to make money”!\n",
      "In closing this review I just want to say that I hope everyone out there finds a lesson in this book that’s right for them, and I hope everyone who does, remembers and takes advantage of the online network that Gundi has been working to build, so that we can talk with each other, and network as well as socialize, because it’s a community (Facebook group) for those of us that read and follow her to work. So if your listening to what she’s teaching in this book, then you will see it’s exactly the perfect place to start. reaching out for shout outs, start asking for the opinions of your peers, check out the things they have to say, see the things they have a look at too, and when it’s asked for be sure to share your opinion with them about the work they are their to share with you too, be sure not to be rude or condescending because I’m sure there are some that are seasoned professionals and others that are first time newbies, but the idea is that we can all succeed with a little help from a friend! At least that is the way I understand what the Author is doing, and because I’ve seen it work in other areas of life having to do with event promotion and fundraising campaigns, I know for sure that when people are not afraid to participate then they are just as important to the group as a whole as anyone else is..... okay this is going beyond the scope of an average review I better let you get started on reading this book if you can believe that it is something that your looking for, and if you’ve spent this much time reading about the book you really should just read the book, because she can tell you a lot better than I can! Thanks for checking out this review too, if it’s helped you make your decision, go ahead a take a second to give the review a “thumbs up” or “like” just so I know I’m not waiting my time and people do find these things helpful, you could even share this review with a friend or social media and help other people get a chance to read and form their own opinion of these great pink books. They honestly get me so excited to read the next one because I feel like I actually learned some new things and that these books have so much to offer everyone who reads them, okay go check it out for yourself!!!!

Each of the 'blueprints' requires, at a minimum, some initial investment of time and effort to learn and establish a business. Each business, in my opinion, appears to be a form of self employment that would, if successful, generate earned income.\n",

      "I read the stories out of order. Ruin me should be read first. Followed by Trent's story and then Vi's. There are HUGE inconsistencies both in this book and subsequent s books. At the beginning of Ruin Me, you learn Kim and Vi have separate homes, early on they party one night and Kim stays at VI's so she'll be closer to work in the morning. Later it's unclear if they are roommates and even later they are roommates. Because I read the books out of order I knew vi was a brunette, at one point in ruin me she is described and she's blonde which disturbed me, I am a very visual reader. Towards the end of the book she's a brunette again. Spoiler alert ... turns out Jackson has an illegitimate child in this book...Jackson and Kim play roles in the other stories, there isn't mention of this daughter. I have truly enjoyed all of the books in all 3 series but there needs to be better character continuity. In VI's story we hear Gavin's last name several times, and then it becomes part of the storyline that Vi doesn't know it. Picky details, which for me is sloppy writing/editing and a bit distracting. Nonetheless I would highly recommend all of he books if you're looking for a steamy entertaining read.\n",

Wasn't a fan of adding a child to the hot mess. A long story like this and what happened to tying up loose ends? Why was a sculpture like the work Kim aspires to even present? It's ok she makes reference to it but what happened to Kim's sculpture? It even said in the story a sculpture of hers would be on display. I was disappointed that Jackson hasn't even seen her work. What is Kim going to do for work when she returns to San Francisco? See what I mean this book was 100+ chapters and nothing was wrapped up.\n",

      "What's the point of reading a shifter romance when the fated mates decides nah we don't want it let's just sleep around?\n",
      "That's supposed to be a sure thing, where the shifters are supposed to be annoyingly devoted and faithful.\n",
      "Now this stupid moose, literally a moose, decides he's not good enough for his mate so the he's way to \"protect\" her would be to hurt her.\n",
      "So she apparently is comfortable with pump and dump. And decided he's no longer worth saving her virginity for, so she is very sexually active AFTER the mating attraction is discovered and he pushed her away. He has asked her to move on but in reality he expected her to stay a virgin, save herself for him, pine for him while he'll take sick satisfaction from constantly refusing her.\n",
      "He was apparently a ladies' man, now whether that was before or after the mate bond, I do not know, however his defence for the acceptability of HIS \"infidelity\" over HERS was \"it's different for me. I'm a man\". Yeah. He went there.\n",

      "This novel was action packed from the get-go. The slight overlap with the previous novel gave me a sense of continuity. Langlais writes vivid descriptions that bring both the scenery and the characters to life. I felt as if I’d been transported to Kodiak Point alongside these vivid individuals. She also worked in a twist on SEALs that gave me more than a few giggle-snort moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Langlais sure knows how to crank up the heat in a relationship. Langlais makes her characters so personal and vividly real. A certain fox-lady definitely drew my attention. She was absolutely priceless in the best of ways. Boris’ bullheadedness was a blast. It stood up very well against Jan’s ‘take no prisoners’ attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Langlais has once again created a suspenseful yet erotically satisfying novel that held my attention from cover to cover. This is one tale that I wouldn’t hesitate, even for a second, to recommend to others.\n",

      "My review and an extended sample of the audiobook are posted at Hotlistens.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had already read this entire series before this series was released on audio, so I had already read all of the books in the Kodiak Point series before starting any of the audios. While I wasn’t a huge fan of the audio of Kodiak’s Claim, I still wanted to continue to give the audios a try, because I love this series.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outfoxed by Love is one of my top two favorite books in the series. I love Boris and his very large and majestic rack. He is retired military with PTSD and he is also a Moose shifter. Don’t let the fact that he is not a predator make you think he isn’t a force to be reckoned with. Moose are one of the deadliest animals in Alaska, more people are actually injured each year in Alaska by moose than bears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jan is another great character. She is my favorite of all the females in this series. Jan is an wiley artic fox. She is also a gun nut. While she appears to be girly, as petite blonde with love of many girly things, she is more than capable in the wilds of Alaska. She has quite the weapons collection and isn’t scared to use any of them. Her parents are hilarious and very manipulative to both Jan and Boris.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outfoxed by Love starts about three quarters of the way through Kodiak’s Claim. Jan has wrecked her truck and is on the run from the bad guys. Boris decided that he must protect the alpha’s petite secretary before she chips a nail. Boris is in for a rude awakening when Jan decides to show him her true colors. There are much shenanigans from the villains reeking havoc on the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this book starts in the middle of the plot of the previous book, you can read this one without having read book one. I do think you will enjoy the story more with a little more background on the villain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Narration\n",
      "If you read my audio review of Kodiak’s Claim, you know I wasn’t a huge fan of the narration. I enjoyed this one better. I don’t know if it is because I love the story of Boris and Jan or if the narration was truly better, but I did like it better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never thought the narration was horrible. I just didn’t think it was a great fit for this series. The humor wasn’t brought out like I felt it should. I think the humor was picked up better in Outfoxed by Love. Maybe with the first book it was a case of “it’s not you, but me”.\n",

      "Welcome to a bewitching cozy mystery series, with a splash of magic. It was set in Britain and follows British English spelling and usage. You will be introduced to charming and lovable characters that entertain the reader through the twists and turns of each mystery, not easily solved. The heroine of this story is named Caitlyn Le Fey.\n",
      "\n",
      "After her mom passed away, she discovered that she was actually adopted after having been abandoned on the side of the road near Tillyhenge, a tiny English village. Caitlyn goes to Tillehenge, where her life changes dramatically. She lives in a room above a chocolate shop, when she isn't staying at Huntingdon Manor and is always eager to do some magic sleuthing whenever another dead body is discovered in their small village.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this installment, Caitlyn is tasked with dealing with her feeling and her relationship with Lord James Fitzroy, which seems to be growing in each book. Will they ever admit their feelings to each other? And will James be able to accept her witchcraft?\n",
      "\n",
      "The story would not be complete without a murder mystery, but this time there are two men murdered and a ghostly black hound has been spotted haunting the countryside. It is not a surprise that the village gossips are positive that witchcraft has something to do with it. Not only does her cousin, Pomoma, jumps in to help, but her feeble and sight deprived Uncle Viktor bumps in to aid as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a clean read, which is I enjoy immensely. I was delighted to discover the lack of any typos or editing errors with this Kindle Unlimited edition (oh how this does deliver a more enjoyable read). The books in this series are able to stand on their own, but reading them in order assures that you don't miss any delightful details. The conclusion delivers an H.E.A. regarding the murder, but there will definitely be more entertainment from the band of merry characters in the remainder of the series!\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Altro buon libro e mi sto abituando al fatto che l'elemento paranormale sia sempre più forte. Questa è una serie che deve essere letta in ordine, secondo me, proprio per apprezzare meglio questo elemento. Ho un paio di dubbi che spero vengano spiegati e risolti presto...\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The author’s Bewitched by Chocolate mystery series has been a B/C read for me. Overall the series has been a light cozy, despite the fact that the main characters are all witches. In the last entry, we were introduced to a dark force that is heralding a potential coming apocalypse. The book also ended on a cliff-hanger, and left me looking forward to the next entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bonbons and Chocolates -- the fifth in the series -- starts one week after the last book ended. James has avoided Caitlyn since then, after her declaration that she’s a witch (he doesn’t believe in witches or any other paranormal beings). But now Caitlyn and her young cousin Evie are headed to a dinner party at James’ home, and there’s been one more mysterious death in the area, plus sightings of a Black Shuck (mythical huge black dog that signals death for someone in your family).\n",
      "\n",
      "While parts of the books are charming, I’m very tired of Caitlyn’s cousin Evie continually trying to do spells, and having them turn into fiascos. It was funny in the first book, but in the fifth it’s just tired. Her other cousin-- Pomona -- is also acting stupidly, going off for days with a mysterious man who seems to be hiding some dark secrets. And then there’s Caitlyn, who goes wandering off in the middle of the night in the woods following what might be a horrible beast. This is not the way sensible people would act. There’s so much more potential without having the key women in the story act ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was definitely a short, fast read, but overall it left me dissatisfied. In fact, I came very close to putting it down at several points. I wanted more progression with the numerous story lines (Caitlyn’s mysterious background, the hints of the coming Apocalypse, and others). Overall I’d give this a C-/D+, and rate it my least favorite in the series, with just two stars here.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I received a free copy from the author and voluntarily reviewed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was another fun book in this series. I was in the mood for a cozy mystery and had just received my copy of this book, so I decide that was the perfect time to read it. After what happened at the end of book 4 Caitlyn is a bit distracted. Then two new murders shake the small town. The legendary black shuck seems to terrorize the country side and there is a dinner party she attends with a lot of undercurrents. And suddenly Caitlyn's romantic troubles seem the least of her problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always have so much fun reading this series and this latest installment was a great one. The mystery kept me guessing for a while, but after some well placed hints I managed to figure out both one of the reveals toward the end and the murderer, but I guessed something wrong as well. I like how the author writes the mysteries in such a way that the reader can figure them out, which is fun. I did think a few of the clues Caitlyn uncovered where a bit too much coincidence upon coincidence and Nibs behavior is a few times used as plot device so Caitlyn could stumble upon something. But I liked how it all got resolved in the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing I really like about this book is how well it combines the paranormal aspect with the mystery. The paranormal aspect is never too much, but is subtly woven throughout everything and it does play an important role. Although Caitlyn doesn't use as much magic in this book, there are enough magical/ paranormal happenings. I thought the Black Shuck plot line was quite interesting. And she also made some progress uncovering a bit about her past. The scene at the end was the hag stone was a bit too much with how Nibs' behavior is used as a plot device so Caitlyn can't uncover everything yet. But I am curious to figure out what exactly the relevance of her rune stone is.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also great how this series has some plot lines that progress throughout the series, like Caitlyn's romance with James, the mystery surrounding Caitlyn's past and rune stone and now there's a plot line surrounding Blackmort as well, that got started in the previous books, but seems to become another longer running plot line. These overarching plot lines help keep the continuity in this series. And ofcourse the seeing the same familiar characters again each book. I was happy to see Ferdinand the bull got an appearance as well in this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "After what happened at the end of the previous book, I wondered how the romance would continue in this book. They have quite the huddle to overcome and I wasn't sure how they would get over it. It did make sense from both their point of views how they acted, which was great and made it feel pretty believable. I was happy to see how things progressed in this book and am curious what this means for the next book.\n",
      "\n",
      "To summarize: I had a lot of fun reading this one. It's again full of magic, paranormal and a good mystery. The mystery kept me guessing at first, I managed to predict a reveal and the murderer, but guessed something else wrong. I like how these mysteries are written in such a way that you can figure them out yourself. I liked seeing some continuing story lines progress in this one. And the romance had a great development at the end of this book. The Black Shuck storyline was petty interesting. And it was fun spending time with some familiar characters again. if you like paranormal cozy mysteries I can't recommend this series enough.\n",

      "Caitlyn Le Fey has been adjusting to the fact that she’s a witch, and having been adopted, she has discovered a grandmother, an aunt, and a cousin, who are all witches, too. Apprenticing in her grandmother’s chocolate shop, she is discovering she has quite the talent for manipulating chocolate, yet answers about her birth, her mother, and why she was abandoned as a baby have not been forthcoming, and her necklace with odd rune markings only adds to her personal mystery. Could there be answers in the locked room at the Manor house? Caitlyn and her BFF Pomona may have found something, but the rumors of a phantom hound, the Black Shuck, prowling the forest along with two odd deaths seem to be more of an immediate concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow! I have been waiting for the next story, and can't be more thrilled! Once again H.Y. Hanna has devised a clever mystery incorporating a real legend of the Black Shuck, a beast that prowled the area of East Angelia. Throwing us off the scent, we are also given several more corporeal suspects with motives of jealousy and greed. As each clue or witness account is explored, it was hard for my inner detective to hone in on one. Hanna’s descriptions of the forest, the manor house, and townspeople of Tillyhenge, along with the mouthwatering caramels and bonbons fill the senses making this fictional town very real to fans. But, she doesn't just rely on the narrative. She has penned delightful dialogue putting the reader into realistic banter, even if it's between Caitlyn and her six-hundred-year-old vampire guardian uncle. Everything works. No hocus-pocus antics. Even with Evie’s comical inexperience with spells and the occasional added ‘umpff’ in the chocolate delicacies, the magic theme works. Even more contemporary are the issues with prejudice. The villagers don't know the truth about Caitlyn and her family, but their bigotry, fears, and jealousy of that which is different manifests in protests and vicious gossip. People take sides, but it only strengthens Caitlyn’s bond with her family. She even chooses to confide in Lord James Fitzroy, but…well, what would you say if the person you are falling for says they are a witch? Fun! Engaging! I highly recommend this fifth book in the series, and although their are no spoilers to effect reading the books out of order, details are slowing being revealed about Caitlyn’s past. You’ll want to read the rest of the series\n",

      "Nicely done evil relatives, an additional evil character that didn’t really make sense, a nice heroine, a hero that showed signs of intelligence, nice little side characters for a sequel then it went downhill. Oops, I just used \"nice\" three times in one sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem. Instead of turning to her husband, THE DUKE, the heroine decides to heroically solve the problem herself and protect her husband from the bad guys. Heavy sigh here! A Duke has almost as much power as major members of the Royal house like a Prince Regent. Sometimes even more considering some of the dunces that have been Prince Regent and no that is not me commenting on the current one.\n",

      "Eva was a wonderful heroine. She was so insecure and shy after years of being bullied by her father and half brothers. The poor girl didn't even think she was attractive and her horrible clothing made her look unattractive to the hero. He didn't realize she was beautiful until he saw her weeks after the wedding day in the new clothes that a neighbor's daughter had helped her to choose. The H had behaved like an idiot to the heroine until he saw how beautiful she was. Damn, but I almost wished he had noticed her beauty when it was hidden beneath the dowdy clothes she used to wear.\n",
      "The love affair between the MC's grew gradually and the H soon realized that his wife was blameless in the scheme that her evil father had concocted. It was nice to see Eva blossom as a duchess and embrace her new role but then her nasty old father and his lecherous friend had to blackmail her by threatening her younger brother with harm. That part was really sad, because her brother had been beaten so many times by the beastly father.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, the H was able to help both the heroine and her brother and the villains got exactly what they deserved. This was a beautiful marriage of convenience romance with a H who had to work hard ( and did ! ) to get into my good books. But the heroine of the story will always be the standout character, in my eyes. This is definitely a story I can read again.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "You know when a book feels cozy? That's how I felt reading this. Even though there's quite a lot of violence and abuse, the hero and heroine bring a certain peace into their characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book was very simply written, a simple plot, simple characters but the feeling it brought was nothing simple. I recommend this book if you like a fast read, a sweet marriage of convenience, rags to rich, enemies to lovers romance.\n",

      "I enjoyed this\n",
      "\n",
      "The hero was great but the heroine was even better. I loved the whole betrothed as children and even though she was brought up by her abusive Father and half brothers she was such a sweet person. I also loved the Grandma. She turned out to be one of my favorite characters. The evil leche r Huxley was terrible and her Father was despicable. My favorite scene was when her Dad was down on the floor and she went over and kicked him. And then She asked if she could punch him too and it was just so funny to me. Her dad was vile.\n",

And no, making your character admit that she shouldn’t had done that doesn’t make her less of an idiot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cherry on the cake for me was for Kate to acuse a guy of rape when he didn’t do it, while covering for the actual rapist, making him an innocent, what about the families of the real victims? You’re making them believe that a guy that didn’t do anything murdered their loved ones. What about rape victims that aren’t believed, and here you are a JOURNALIST lying about being raped because you’re useless and needs your stepfather to find you a job.\n",

In some stories, this style makes for an intriguing story that keeps us guessing. This style, however, didn't work for me with this book. It was pretty obvious from the get go what happened and when we finally get the whole story - at a very odd time might I add - it felt kinda laughable, honestly.\n",

Beneath all of the sadness from his passing, I've also been horribly mad. I never got the opportunity to even see him alive even once on that Tuesday, to let my monster come walking and hold me up with its monstrous hands as I said the words I didn't think I'd ever have the bravery to utter. All of the little things that you thought would be indelible really can go away, just in the last couple of months I can't remember what my dad's voice sounds like anymore, and every time I look in the mirror, I see my dad; it's a blessing and a curse to look just like him. So for these three long years I've lied to myself; saying things like \"it was his time\" and \"there was nothing I could do to stop it\" all of those things that people you to say and expect to hear after the death of a loved one. But, after this book, I, like Conor, realize that I didn't want him to go, dammit. He was my the guy that got up every morning early just to tell me that he loved me. He was my confidante, my every Tuesday night ice cream sandwich \"date\", my Trekkie, my best friend. And I learned from A Monster Calls that it's okay to be selfish like that, because you need to be able to say that you want to hold onto the people you love most before you can truly let go. I'm not saying that the change for me will be immediate, but this amazing novel by Patrick Ness showed me that it really is okay. That, right there, is one of the best things that a novel can do, to truly be able to affect a person to a core. And that's what A Monster Calls did to me in more ways than one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could also relate to Conor's feelings of being alone, ignored, and being treated \"specially\" just because of circumstance. Not only were the stares practically unbearable, but it reminded me every day of what I'd lost. You begin to shrink inside yourself in order to avoid it all, and, at the time, you to become unseen to your fellow classmates; because being invisible is better than the stares, the pity, the concern. Whether your loved one has passed or it's imminent, you don't want to believe that it's actually going to happen or has happened. No matter how much you've said the total opposite to yourself and everyone else; there's still a small part of you that thinks they're just been on vacation and are going to walk through that door, wrap you in a hug, and tell you how much they missed you while they were gone. Those stares just diminish that little shred of hope that you've got, so Conor and people like myself react by shutting off. Again, like I and Conor learned, once you're shut off, it sucks. Big time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm one of those kind of people that is more an introvert than extrovert when it comes to emotional pain. When my dad died, though, I broke. I cried for a solid hour, and even when I was able to stop myself, the total shaking of my body didn't stop. I can remember everything that night through those shakes, my little sister screaming, my mom calling and asking in garbled speech if I wanted to see my dad's body one more time before the funeral. But I couldn't do that. I couldn't go. Couldn't accept that he was actually gone. The shakes didn't stop until I finally fell asleep on my dad's side of the bed hours later. I only really cried hard one other time after that, a day before my dad's funeral, but since then, I hated myself for it. For being weak and crying when my mom and sisters were needing someone so desparetly to help them. I haven't cried like that since then, and for a whole year I tried to fill the space my dad left. It was useless, but I tried: I made the meals, cleaned the house, mowed the lawn, did all that I could to ease their pain and worries while only tending to my own late at night, silently crying into my pillow. What Ness showed me through Conor was that it's okay to cry while others are watching, to let them take care of me and what I've dealt with, for three long, and yet, at the same time, short three years. A Monster Calls was able to let me take some of the pressure and pain out of that bottle of pent-up emotions and sadness, and I can't thank Patrick Ness and Siobahn Dowd enough for doing that for me through Connor.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I loved all of the stories that the monster-although I don't really think of him as a monster anymore which I think is part of the irony of A Monster Calls- told. Even to the third and final story you really don't know how it's going to end and what the moral (or, possibly, no moral at all) is of each one. And they're not just a bunch of random stories that have no meaning to the plot. They literally the plot. It's what drives the whole story and gives Connor the dimensions beyond just a little boy grieving his dying mother. It gives the shading of a character that helps us as readers see his drive and purpose for doing all that he is doing, which you just don't find very often these days. I wouldn't have been able to relate Conor's feelings of loss and pain without them, and that would have been a total shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can I just say that I absolutely the monster, because I did. He, or it, or whatever, was just such an amazing character. His cryptic answers, interesting stories, the ability to discern what is true and what isn't, and was there for Connor when he needed him to be really made him feel like a god, or; at least, how a god should be. At first, in the beginning of the book, when he started declaring about his \"many names\" and how awesome, powerful, and ageless he was, I thought, but Ness's monster talks the talk, and walks the walk superbly and graciously. I will never forget about the monster made of an ancient Yew tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe someday, when I'm ready, or even totally unprepared, my monster will finally come walking, and I sincerely hope for that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writing for the story was perfect. It had just the right amount of lyrical prose, a pubescent teen's voice, and an adult enough sounding idea and story that it will keep practically anyone 13+ entertained and effected for the rest of their lives in the best way possible. I basically loved everything about this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I'm about to say next is a joke. It's freaking weird, but not a joke:\n",
      "\n",
      "After I was finished with this book and sitting in my contemplative and teary-eyed silence, my mom, not even five minutes later, walked up and told me something totally shocking, knowing nothing of the book and what I'd just read. She told us that our close neighbors's daughter-who has two kids- was diagnosed with severe uterine cancer, and that the prognosis for her survival was not good. I was totally astounded at the coincidence and meaning of it all. The feelings that went through me at this point are really hard to describe, but it really goes to show that you never know when it's going to happen, and you need to be able to start the process of letting go at any time, because you never really know when yours and anyone you love's time is going to be up. It was like an extra slap to the face after reading this book about how cruel-and sad- life can really be, sometimes. If I have to make any request to anyone from reading this review, it's to, please, never regret a single moment, and make every single one precious.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end I would recommend this book with all of my heart to anyone and everyone. It is touching, poignant, and amazing. You absolutely do not want to miss out on this read.\n",

      "I got back to my apartment in Bulgaria and thought I'd read a little bit of this novel before I went to bed. 2 hours later I was still sat in my original position but by this time I was sobbing my heart out. Literally sat there crying like a baby to myself. I doubt this book will be everyone's cup of tea but, whatever it has, it really worked it's magic on me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought was pretty much amazing in every way; from it's darkly beautiful illustrations (worth buying a paper copy for) to the great big touching metaphor that is the backbone of the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Didn't like ? Not a problem. Forget it's by the same author whether you liked his previous books or not. Pretend you've never heard of before because this is nothing like anything he has ever written. It's nothing like anything I've ever read. Where the Chaos Walking trilogy was a fast-paced adventure story, this is a very moving, well-written tale of a boy who's mum has cancer. It's about loss, and that doesn't necessarily mean death, and it's also about learning to let go and forgive yourself and others around you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Like I said, this is a very different sort of idea (credit to the late Siobhan Dowd) and not the kind of book where you can guess where it's going. It's odd and unpredictable and very sad. Conor is one of those tragic but believable characters that you feel for all the way through. He faces constant battles in every aspect of his life. There's the obvious problem of his mother's illness, but also the fact that his dad has moved to America to start a new life with his new wife and baby. School offers no escape from Conor's miserable reality either as he finds himself between bullies who pick on him because they can and teachers who make their pity obvious every time they talk to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then one night a monster visits Conor. A dream? An ancient creature that appears to those in need? Anything is possible, none of which is important. This monster is here for one purpose... to tell Conor three stories in exchange for the truth. Conor begins to learn that things aren't always as they seem and right and wrong are not so easily defined.\n",

      "As I am writing this, there are still tears coursing down my face--black from my mascara. I may look like something straight out of a horror movie, but my soul feels lighter somehow. I was fooled into thinking this would be a simple story as it is only 200 pages, but it is not. It is so not. This book is raw and emotional and cathartic. It deals with grief, loss, and anger in ways I have never read about before, but only experienced. I don't know what else to say except that everyone should read this book at least once.\n",

      "3 ½ stars – Paranormal Romance/Erotica/Ménage/BDSM\n",
      "\n",
      "Apprentice witch Sybil, frustrated and bored with being treated like a fledgling errand girl by her coven, goes looking for some action, buys a seemingly worthless, innocent book of magic at an estate sale, and inadvertently ends up opening a gate to the shadow realm that can unleash demons and possibly end the world. So what’s a witch to do to make things right again and save humanity? How about submitting to a big ol’ sex fest with five immortals who serve as the Shadow Guardians for the goddess Inanna in an elemental ritual that will unleash her power and bind her to their ancient brotherhood? Besides, how bad could it possibly be, living as a pampered, pleasured sexual plaything with five supernatural studs of varying, voracious sexual appetites?\n",
      "\n",
      "This doesn’t have much of a plot and there’s minimal character development, but it does have loads of sex. Sybil and her quintet of paranormal paramours (a surly, brooding, tortured alpha werewolf, a flirtatious, jovial dragon with a tale that can do all kinds of kinky, naughty things, a devilishly sexy chaos demon with retractable black wings, a stoic two-thousand-year-old Roman centurion vampire, and an ethereal, elfin fae god with a proclivity for domination, bondage, and punishment) engage in a variety of sexual escapades and excesses: anal, voyeurism, exhibitionism, ménage, and mild BDSM play. Of course, even though she has to sexually submit to all five guardians (individually and together when requested), only one can ultimately claim Sybil as their mate, and you can probably guess from the book’s title (no spoiler warning necessary here) which immortal warrior wins that coveted spot?\n",
      "\n",
      "So if you’re in the mood for an uncomplicated paranormal erotic romance that doesn’t have much depth but does have plenty of steamy sex, then this story of a nympho witch ‘getting it on’ hot and heavy with five supernatural, immortal hunks might be a “good read” for you. 3 ½ stars.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I was mentally exhausted while reading this book. There is a story in this book but the story is wrapped around Sybil having sex, lots and lots of sex with 5 beasts, I mean men over 5 days. Did I mention she has lots and lots of sex? After reading Animal Attraction by Teglia, I am starting to see a pattern here. Sex, lots of it, with lots of men over a very short period of time. Hmmmm... doesn't sound bad to me.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "So. What do I think of this book then. Oh my. Where do I start?? I guess I'll start by saying it's pretty well written. No awkward grammar or sentence structures. Well, almost none. A book that is well written, no matter how dumb I think it is, automatically rates higher on my scale of 1 to 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plot. Wow. I guess it can be discussed whether the plot is good or bad, or even there at all. Because this book is one huge orgy with a basic plot at the beginning to lead into the orgy, and a little bit of plot to wrap the story up nicely. Though, the book ends on the biggest orgy of them all, with six \"people\" in the bed. Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is just so cheesy with all the orgies, that I couldn't help but love it. The cheesiness that is. But rather than being plot driven, or having solid characters, it's all a huge multiple menage fantasy. You have a witch that hooks up for 24 hours each, with a wolf/shapeshifter, a dragon/shapeshifter, a demon, a vamp, and a fey. One on one is a given with everyone, but it is mixed up with threesomes and foursomes and voyeurism/exhibitionism. You even get some tail (!) action in there. No joke.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this orgy going on non-stop gets tiring after a while. It quickly goes from sexy to just plain weird. I had to skim through large chunks of all this porn. At times it was borderline bestiality. So a little bit of almost ick going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got about 4/5th through the book, I was ready to flounce. But I wanted to see how the \"plot\" was wrapped up, so I powered through. Almost wish I hadn't. There wasn't much plot to speak of, and that final 6 person-orgy at the end was just...meh. Oh, and it's only the girl that gets all the attention here, no boy on boy action. At all. Not even any boy on boy flirting to break things up a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently all this author writes is erotica, and having read , does not tempt to read anything else by this author. When it gets to be too much of a good thing, it becomes work to read it, and I read because I want to escape, to be entertained, without having to think too much about it. (If this last part made any sense to anyone but me, I'll be surprised. LOL)\n",

I was looking forward to reading something interesting when I picked this up but really it was gross!!! ;( So the main character, Sybil, she's a witch and she gets into some trouble with a dark book. That's where the five guardians of the gate come in. They are supposed to keep the book out of the hands of evil but didn't know where it was until now.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dark book has a mind of it's own and buries all of it's dark spells and magic into Sybil. The guardians now have to watch out for her but the thing is she can't control the magic. But there is a way,.....she can become immortal like the guardians. In order to do that she needs to get the mark of the goddess for whom the guardians work for. So she says yes to the mark. Now wait for it.......to get the mark she has to have sex with all FIVE of the guardians. I mean can you say gross!\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand some people might be into that but that is gross.! BLahhh! ;( I hated the ending. She loves all of them but she is love with Kenrick the wolf.

      "\n",
      "This book was not at all romantic in any way and every single good fighting scene ends up with her having sex with one of the guys! I didn't like that at all.

      "\n",
      "In my opinion, there was way too much sex for my liking (like every single page). Now don't get me wrong sure I like romance in my reading but not a freaking porno book! It was gross. I am just surprised I finished! Also, although some might think Sybil had to sleep with them, she was given a choice and could have said no! She acted like a slut and kept on repeating how much she hated it when in head she kept on saying she wanted more! PISSED, PISSED, PISSED!!!!!! I honestly don't think I will read any other book in the series, if ever one comes out.\n",

      "Rose sent a letter to her cousin Alice Beckingham imploring her not to look any closer into the matter of her brother Edward’s death. Rose explains that an enigmatic criminal, with whom she has had some strange contact in the past, was the one who influenced her brother’s crime, ordered his contract killing in prison, and fallen off a bridge into the Thames. Alice, however, doesn’t hear the word “dead,” and there are way too many questions left unanswered, so despite the warning, she still decides she will “look closer.” But for now, she’s expected to attend the theatre with her parents, an opportunity to wear her deep red dress, sitting in a private box courtesy of Mr. Williamson with an offer to meet the cast back stage. Arriving to see several friends, they discuss the handsome lead, the plot of the play, and the surprise ending the critics report...but no one thought the “surprise ending” would be murder. Blythe Baker’s writing style is very enjoyable with descriptive language and expressive dialogue creating a picturesque setting, tone, emotion, varied characters, and a sense of realism. As the reader, the use of a first-person narrative from Alice’s “I” perspective gives me a vicarious role and adds to my engagement with the drama. Clever. Entertaining. And for readers who’ve been reading the entire three-book series, more answers are uncovered for some closure. I highly recommend the series!\n",

      "This is now the third book I have read in this series, and I find that I quite enjoy this author's writing style. She puts us firmly in the heroine's head, and we get to see the world through her eyes. As the book takes place in the 1920s, her world is in a state of transition, even if she is not fully aware of it. The author describes this world well so that I can imagine the heroine as if she is actually walking around back in those times. Yet, the descriptions don't seem overly flowery or too much; they are just about right. We've seen some of these characters in all the books now, and I appreciate that the author has them on a slow, believable character growth arc. This isn't a super heavy or serious mystery series, so if that is your preference, you most likely will not enjoy this book or its predecessors. But if you like your mysteries light, like I do, and steeped in the Roaring Twenties world (which I find wicked fun), you may very well enjoy this series as much as I do.\n",

      "I am always a big fan of Faleena Hopkins and her Cocky series! This one was no different!! However, this one was a little deeper and darker with more intense issues, and brought to light the human condition and what parents will do to protect their children. Sean, a new recruit to the Ciphers MC has so much to prove not only to the group, but to himself as well. Everything is riding on his success with this group. He has had some hard times, that have changed the course of his life and it is time for healing and for positive change. Celia, born and raised in the Cipher household is a strong and trained young woman. She is fierce and brave, and understands the importance of helping others. When Sean arrives, she is part of the team that trains him in combat and weaponry. She has known love and freedom and toughness her whole life and has been fortunately raised in this house of deep family roots. She is set on helping Sean become a part of this family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sean and Celia have a connection that cannot be denied, but it is brought about through their ability to have empathy and compassion for each other. Their story is so beautifully written because it demonstrates how not only two people, but a family, can come together to heal another hurting member. The story demonstrates the strength of its members and how even the most unexpected of people can be the one who sets healing in motion. Sean and Celia both victims of circumstance find a way to heal not only themselves, but each other with an amazing love that blooms and spreads beautifully. The way the story unfolds is empowering and allows us to realize the importance of life and family and how easily life changing situations can be addressed positively with the needed strength and support from the family. This story, through the coming together of Sean and Celia, is beautiful and full of love. It is a page turner that has you wanting to know how it is going to turn out, not only for Sean and Celia, but for others as well. This is a must read for anyone who wants to read about empowerment and family love. Faleena, Kuddos to you!! I love how you bring serious issues to light in your books! Thanks. I read this voluntarily as an ARC for an honest review.\n",

      "I have to say that I have not read one book in this series that was not a great story.  With that being said, this book is no different.  It is an amazing story with amazing characters.  Faleena Hopkins has created a family with the Cocker Series.  Not only with her books but with her fans as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this story Celia thinks she is in love with Atlas.  That is until Atlas snitches on his on brother Luke.  When  Luke is sent away, everyone is tense in the household.  Celia wants to be there for Atlas, but she still finds it hard to be ok with what he did.  When a new guy named Sean is introduced into the house, Celia's feelings start to change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sean is misunderstood.  He is always in trouble because he fights for those who can't fight for themselves.  Not understood by normies, he feels misplaced like an outsider.  That is until he meets the Ciphers.  When he is given the chance to try out for the MC, he jumps on it.  He will do what he must to become a Cipher, even if it means not acting on his feelings for the beautiful Celia.  But when secrets come out of the dark hiding spaces, his time with the MC may just be reaching an expiration date.  Can he prove he is worthy?\n",
      "\n",
      "This book was a pretty emotional book compared to some of the others.  I always like reading about Jett and his MC family.  They are brave and strong.  They live by their own code and help those who can't help themselves.  The characters may be tough on the outside, but deep down they are soft and kind.  They love deeply.  Wonder if we will get Atlas's story one day.\n",

      "\n",
      "Fate sometimes has a way of setting your life in the right direction and such is the case with Sean; abused as a youngster and instead of becoming belligerent he chose the route of sticking up for the ones that cannot do this on their own. His lifestyle earns him points to have a trial period with the Ciphers' Club. This is his chance for a better life and being able to do what he knows best; a protector. Celia is a beauty and notices Sean upon his arrival as does Sean notice her. Celia becomes one of his trainers and he has many moments when he wants to pull her aside for the whirlpool of desires he holds for her but keeping his head in the training game is pivotal; he must be voted into the Ciphers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soul-Stirring fabulous well-written read that keeps you intrigued until the conclusion. I absolutely loved Sean's honesty, loyalty, and protectiveness; Sean is twice the hero and Celia is definitely a force to be reckoned with. A few twists and moments that tug your heart, action, witty-banter makes you smile and laugh and the romance is fiery passionate. I do so love the camaraderie and family atmosphere among the Ciphers and wish I could join them on their adventures. I found this to be impressive and entertaining; loved it and I await the next book. A fantastic choice for your library if you enjoy fast-paced adventurous romance. Without reservations, I recommend this read.\n",

      "\n",
      "I am so sad to see this series end. It really doesn't have to! There are still so many stories that they could create! Please, please, please! Or maybe write a spin-off series??? Something!! That's the end of my fangirl moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taken by Fire is mainly the story of Stryker. He has such a cool power, he can affect basically earth, so watch out you don't piss him off or you may cause an earthquake! He is assigned to kill Melanie/Phoebe, the chick with two personalities that killed Akbar in the forest at the end of the last book. He watched as his friend burned in front of him, so this mission is personal for him. He wants to squeeze the life out of her!\n",
      "\n",
      "Except once he finds her she explains to him about her dual personality. Can he believe her? There are actually two people living inside her body thanks to an Itor experiment, Phoebe is the bad one, and Melanie is the good one. Phoebe is out most of the time and has abused Melanie for a long time. Phoebe is the Itor agent, Melanie doesn't know anything. They each have a different power, Phoebe is fire, Melanie is ice. And yes, they find out that she's Alek's daughter (head of Itor), which of course makes Dev change his plans and decide to just bring her in, not kill her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She needs sex to recharge her powers and when they find themselves in a situation where he needs her to get them out of a bind, he is the only choice for sex. After that first time, which was rough, she admits that even though her body might've not been, she was actually a virgin, and yes, Oz's prediction comes back to mind\n",
      "\n",
      "He quickly starts developing feelings for Melanie, and after those first few rushed times, which were still pretty hot, there's more of a connection between them. Can I just say that even though this book was just a tad less creative in the sex department, at least with the main characters, they still had some hot scenes. They joined the mile high club and almost brought down the plane with both their powers; the back of an SUV after playing and training with her powers; he sits down at the kitchen table to have dessert *THUD*\n",
      "\n",
      "So yeah, I liked the main characters in this one. I felt bad for Melanie, I hated Phoebe she was a total bitch! And let me warn you, Phoebe does get a little rough and there might be some scenes where you can't believe they went that far with what she was allowed to do, but that was still ok with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let me get to my favorite characters of ACRO. In every book, Creed&Annika and Dev&Gabe&Oz were also reason enough for me to keep reading. Their side storylines are amazing in my opinion. I did feel a lack of Creed and Annika in this book, we didn't get a lot of time with them and I missed them. Annika is pregnant, Creed is stressing out about Oz's vision that she would die if she has his child, Annika is pissed at Stryker for sleeping with Akbar's killer. But we didn't see a lot of Creed/Annika time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dev... He was my favorite character in this book! He is so intense, emotionally raw and devastatingly hot! Gabe is actually more the romantic and wants more from Dev than a booty call. Dev has to learn to cope with that and to give Gabe what he needs while still dealing with the takedown of Itor and his newly found sister(s) in ACRO's custody. Some of the best sex, and almost sex scenes in this book are Dev & Gabe's. Oh.My.Gawd!!!!!! HAWT! That's all I got to say. You have to read it! And yes, there is a threesome in this one! Oz gets to have a body for just one night!!!! *THUD*\n",
      "\n",
      "The last two or three chapters of this book had me in tears... constantly. I cried for everyone! I'm tearing up again now. It seemed like there would be no resolutions or happy endings for anybody, and my heart was breaking. It was a great ending! Full of emotion, full of action. The ACRO family is all there. But I still don't want it to end! I can't let go!\n",

      "Oh boy, what a fantastic ride this series was, and what a perfect ending for it. I loved EVERY freaking page of Taken by Fire. This book was definitely the master piece of the series, totally exceed every other book in it. The ACRO series was outstanding and so different from all the other series in this genre.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book was just sublime, and it finally gave us a closure to all that had been developing since book 1, a flawless closure by the way. It just could't have gone any better than it did. I freaking cried with this book, which is something that hasn't happened to me with a book since so long I can't even remember the last time it happened. So many truths get revealed, so many lives get at risk, and the plot just couldn't help to get even better than what it already was... So how are we suppose not to ADORE this book? If you guys liked the previous books in this series you're gonna LOVE this one. This series has been growing on me with each new book and after the last couple of books I just got addicted to it, but nothing had prepared me for the amazing time I had reading this last book. PERFECTION. Sigh, I just wish this series didn't have to end but it really was the perfect ending and another book would just ruin that. So I will congratulate both authors to be able to realize the perfect timing to finish it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this last installment we get to read about Stryker and Phoebe/Melanie. I must admit I had been dying to read about this 2 characters for way too long, I just adored them both since we met them in the previous books. Both characters are amazing on their own, from their personalities to their reactions. But together they are even better, they had a great chemistry. Then we get to read about Dev and how he finally got his well deserved HEA. We also get a little glimpse of every single character we met in the previous books. This book has everything it needs to keep you glued to the chair. Sigh. I'll miss this series so much, it really had something different from all the rest, which was what I adored the most about it. I just know I wont be able to find it anywhere else. 10 points for originality.\n",

So just to up the anti Chris proposes that if Robert loses he kidnap a friend of his like his ancient relatives did when getting their future brides. Robert bets that Chris will be stuck in the stockades on his island and have fruit thrown at him. Robert of course loses and goes about to capture his cousins friend, not knowing until later that he has the wrong woman. Or does he? Can he be falling for the woman that he kidnapped? Will she feel the same for him?\n",

      "I loved the Taken by a Trillionaire series , so when I got a copy of Virgin Conquer I was thrilled and I dived into the book as soon as I could and it was fantastic. In this book we follow Robert and Izzy and this story definitely starts off with of in a very interesting way . We see Robert kidnap Izzy and at first I was wondering to myself what is going on here , however it turns out that it was all a prank , however Izzy is not the person that was supposed to kidnap and as things are set in motion Robert cant stop the plan and on top of that along the way Robert and Izzy end up falling in love and this really where things take off in this story . I loved watching Izzy and Robert fall in love it was fantastic, even though they where in a very sticky situation with the kidnapping, you could see that these two had chemistry with each other that neither could deny . This story was sexy , addicting, fun and had one of the most swoon worthy endings I have read in a long time . I am so sad to see this series end . Virgin to conquer was fantastic! and if you love all these things in your books you should definitely pick up a copy.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Not a bad book, but a bit of a disappointment. While I did enjoy the enjoy the unusual relationship between Robert and Isabella for the most part, most of my issues stem from the continuity from the other two books. Ruth Cardello introduced some possible conflict between the royal family and the Arcano in Virgin for the Trillionaire, and even more conflict with the Arcano in J.S. Scott's Virgin for the Prince, I was really disappointed to not have that underlying conflict come to a conclusion in this book. In fact, the Arcano is barely mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a decent romance by itself but falls short ending the conflict started with this series. I mean really? Nothing else happens with the royal family and the Arcano after what they did to Nic? Nic barely \"broke the rules\", but Robert totally disregards them with no consequences?\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I have to say, I love these little fantasy islands that Melody Anne, JS Scott and Ruth Cardello have created. They are extravagant , rich and over the top but oh so much fun. Prince Robert did not disappoint, he was head strong and a bit of a rebel. His love for his country is most likely the only thing that keeps him even remotely in line. After he loses a bet to his cousin, he tries to play a trick on his family by kidnapping his bride as their cousins from his sister island have done. However things don't go as planned and he gets the wrong woman, who turns out to be oh so right. Even though she protests he can see her desire. What states out as a joke soon becomes no laughing matter and he finds himself coming close to losing his woman. Isabella fell hard and fast even though she tried not to. As fate would have it she couldn't say no to the prince!\n",

      "\n",
      "Marie Force is a very well-known and popular writer of romantic suspense and contemporary romance novels, and is now turning her hand to writing historical romance.  Based on this first foray into the genre, I’m afraid I have to say that she should stick to writing what she knows best, because Duchess by Deception is simply awful; it’s based on a flawed premise and is full of more really tired clichés than you can shake a bundle of sticks at.\n",
      "\n",
      "Derek, Duke of Westwood, came into his title at the tender age of six following the death of his parents in a carriage accident.  He has grown into his role and is a dedicated young man who manages his responsibilities admirably and is genuinely concerned for the welfare of all those who depend on him – even moreso as his thirtieth birthday approaches.  Because, you see, some ancestor or other put a stipulation in his will that the holders of the title MUST be married by the age of thirty, or they will forfeit it and the dukedom will pass to the next heir.  And Derek, with just a week or so go to before his thirtieth birthday,  hasn’t yet found a woman he wants to marry.  The new crop of debutantes each Season are more vacuous than the last, (and don’t get me started on the sexism inherent in statements like this – “) – and while he isn’t necessarily holding out for a love match, he does want a wife with whom he can hold intelligent conversations and share affectionate companionship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so now let’s rewind.  Derek must marry by his thirtieth birthday or abdicate his title. Er, nope.  British inheritance law doesn’t work like that. It does not allow for a peer to make any stipulations of this sort as to how his title progresses; a title is not a possession and thus is not something that can be bequeathed or have conditions attached to it.  For instance, the Queen doesn’t have a say in who succeeds her (although in very, very exceptional circumstances, I daresay she could, which would involve all sorts of constitutional upheaval and acts of Parliament) and as far as I know, this goes for the peerage as well. So the novel’s plot is based on a completely erroneous premise, which, in my book, is enough to sink it without trace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Derek, being the conscientious young man he is, is determined to do his duty and find a wife by his birthday, especially as his current heir is his father’s brother – Derek’s uncle – who is a grasping, dastardly individual who has always wanted the title for himself (he and Derek’s father were twins and Anthony was born second) because he deserved it.  It was he who engineered the accident that killed Derek’s parents (this isn’t a spoiler, as it’s revealed in the first chapter) and he still chafes that Derek wasn’t with them, as he was supposed to have been – and so his evil plot to become the Duke was foiled.  Can I get a ‘MUAHAHAHAHA’? And just in case we aren’t clear about Anthony’s ambitions, his mistress is there to hit readers over the head with a tea-tray:\n",

      "Seriously?  I wonder if Ms. Force has read any historical romance since the 1980s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway.  While travelling back to his estate, Derek comes across a filthy boy in shoddy clothing digging in a field.  Wondering why there is a filthy boy in shoddy clothing digging in one of his fields, Derek stops to ask questions, the boy bolts, Derek catches him, the boy passes out – but not before his cap falls off to reveal long dark tresses… and lo! ‘tis the heroine in disguise.   Arrived at his ancestral pile, Derek’s protective instincts are on high alert, and even though the young woman is dirty and smelly, he unaccountably wants to care for her, crawl into bed next to her and   So he does. (After she’s had a bath, natch.)\n",
      "\n",
      "When she awakens and is told she’s at the Duke of Westwood’s estate, the young woman – Catherine – is immediately fearful and makes clear her dislike of peers of the realm, so Derek decides not to tell her he’s a duke, but instead introduces himself as the estate manager because he wants to know more about her.  But that has to be put on hold while they get back into bed for spurious reasons and cuddling and flirting ensues.  She’s just woken from a fever, they don’t know each other,  they’ve barely said two words to each other and yet she comes up with things like:\n",

      "In a nutshell.  Catherine is running from the slobbery old bloke she’s supposed to marry and doesn’t want anything to do with the aristocracy. Two days after their first meeting, she and Derek are sucking face and then shagging (and joy of joys, she gets to say  and at the 30% mark, they’re running off to Gretna Green to get married, presumably so he can marry her without revealing his true identity, which is dumb, but no dumber than the other dumb stuff in this dumb book.\n",

      "No prizes for guessing what happens next.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writing is stilted and often unintentionally funny (see quotes above) – not what I’d expect from an experienced author – and the characters are barely two dimensional.  Given Ms. Force is known for writing steamy sex scenes, the ones in this book are dull and there is zero chemistry between the leads.  There’s a secondary romance that also takes off like a rocket, between Derek’s cousin (Anthony’s son) and Catherine’s younger sister, and to call the villainous Anthony ‘cartoonish’ is, frankly, to insult cartoon villains the world over.\n",

If you’ve never read Marie Force before, do yourself a favour and read the excellent , or one of her romantic suspense titles.  I hope she’s not going to stop writing those, because in spite of its lovely cover and less-used setting of 1902 (which is largely irrelevant to the story anyway),  is terrible.\n",

      "Marie Force has been a prominent and well-loved figure in the contemporary romance and romantic suspense scenes for years, and this is her move into the historical romance genre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did it work for me? Uh… no, not really. Ignoring the sexist opening chapter for a moment, my problem with is that it reads like a throwback to the books of the 1980s, and it doesn’t seem like Force has kept up with the changes in the genre since then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially I was excited about the book’s description. Mystery unconscious woman doing suspicious things on the duke’s property? Uncommon Edwardian era setting? Sounded interesting. However, apart from some research info-dumps about technological developments, the feel of this one was no different to any century-earlier, Regency-set book (were not more an 18th century than 20th century thing? Why are they still being used in 1902?).\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the tired and silly trope of the hero who has to marry by a certain date or he’ll lose his title needs to be permanently retired. It’s simply not how the aristocracy works.\n",

      "While isn’t a horrible read, it is also a throwback to things most HR writers and readers moved on from years ago. Force will shoot to prominence in the genre simply because she comes in with an already established name as an author, but I’ve read lesser-known historical romance books by lesser-known authors that are surely as worthy of the attention.\n",

So many reviewers are calling this book a Regency romance, even though it's set nearly a whole century after the Regency era. A huge problem is that the author like a Regency romance, completely ignoring all technological advancements from the early 19th to 20th centuries.\n",
      "\n",

      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I’m going to start this review by saying that Marie Force is one of my favourite contemporary romantic suspense authors, and someone I deeply respect in the writing world.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with that said, I really, really wish she hadn’t tried her hand at historical romance because this is a hot mess. It’s got some absolute clangers in terms of historical inaccuracies and a hero who tells continued and repeated lies to the heroine and then tries to tell her it’s all for her benefit. While refusing to allow her to sleep apart from him because ‘she’d never forgive him if he gave her too much time to think about the many ways he’d done her wrong’ and basically forcing himself on her even when she told him she wanted him to leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s start with the historical and geographic inaccuracies. Set in 1902, mostly at the Duke of Westwood’s Essex estate. However, it reads more like a Regency romance than an Edwardian one; the only thing non-Regency was ‘collar and tie’ on the gentlemen rather than cravats. The duke, Derek, and his love interest Catherine elope to Gretna Green to get married hastily… which is the first thing I scowled at. In 1856 the law was changed to stop the scandalous Scottish marriages taking place, requiring at least one member of a couple wishing to marry to be resident in Scotland for 21 days prior to a marriage. Which didn’t happen. So in 1902, no couple from England are running off to Gretna and getting married on the day of their arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which brings me to another point. In 1902, the journey from Essex to Scotland could have been managed in a couple of days, as Derek and Catherine did - but certainly not by horse-drawn carriage, which would have been a 6-day journey at least, but nobody would do it that way. Trains ran the length and breadth of Britain by that time and they would only have taken a carriage as far as the nearest station. Guess what else isn’t even mentioned in the book? That’s right. No trains. The Duke’s carriage magically transports them from Essex to Scotland with just one overnight stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historical and geographic inaccuracies aside, I thoroughly disliked the plot of this book. Derek flat-out lies to Catherine about who he is and continues to do so even after they’re married until he’s caught out, which is dubious consent in my book at the very least. And then he refuses to allow her to be righteously angry because he’s afraid she won’t forgive him, which would frankly be the least of what he deserves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and did I mention the sex? This pair are at it like rabbits within a few days of meeting, before getting married and afterwards, and not content with them, Force also writes in a romance between the duke’s cousin and Catherine’s younger sister and writes a whole separate story in which they get married and have sex too. There were so many sex scenes I started skimming them after a while. This is NOT supposed to be erotica.\n",
      "\n",
      "I almost quit reading this at the 70% mark, but I don’t believe in critiqueing something without full and informed knowledge, so I soldiered on. Shortly after that Catherine did finally read Derek the riot act properly, saying she couldn’t reconcile the goodness she saw in him with the man who repeatedly lied to the woman he claimed to love. At which point he went off in a sulk and took off to London for three days, letting her find out about it from the housekeeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guess what? The genuinely epic grovel this story desperately needed never, ever happened, Catherine decided sex with Derek was good enough to not care about his lies and when he fell ill with influenza, blamed herself for putting stress on him, and SHE apologized to HIM. Self-gaslighting was a new low even for this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I honestly can hardly believe a writer with as much talent as Marie Force wrote this utterly dreadful drivel. Please, please go back to writing contemporary suspense, ma’am. Or maybe get a sensitivity reader and an editor knowledgeable about the historical period you’re writing about to clean up the horrible mess of inaccuracies and dubious consent before you publish the rest of the series.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can hardly believe I’m saying this, but I cannot possibly give this awful story any more than one star.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book for review through NetGalley.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "With Marie Force’s trademark stamp of likeable characters, romance and steam by the bucketload and a Downton Abbey-esque setting, Duchess by Deception introduces us to Derek Eagon, Duke of Westwood and Lady Catherine McCabe whose feelings for one another move at a fair old clip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My thoughts on this are mixed with parts I enjoyed and those less so. Overall it was an easy-going, low-drama historical romance and as the story moved along, my enjoyment increased. However it was impacted by the rapid speed at which Catherine and Derek fell for one another making it difficult to believe their feelings were real especially considering what she had experienced and some of the the narrative didn’t quite fit the period, for example endearments such as , don’t really belong in early 1900’s England. A little extra research wouldn’t have gone amiss either as with all the will in the world and a really fast horse, you’re not making a carriage journey from Essex to Gretna Green overnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there’s no taking away the fact that the romance is front and centre and it’s passionate and sexy which is one of the many reasons why Marie Force is one of my most-read authors. And although I may not have loved , the setup for has me curious enough to see whether a US based story works better for me and the author writing this genre.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This review is for the Advanced Review Copy. It seems the finished version might be slightly different, regarding the duke's title.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suspension of disbelief required\n",
      "\n",
      "I will most probably be accused of being mean-spirited or petty, but the moment I saw the blurb, I knew I had to read this book. The blurb says that the duke will lose his title if he is not married before his thirtieth birthday. The thing is, this is impossible: a dukedom is a matter of birthright and no cockamamie scheme can deprive the rightful heir of his title. No one chooses who will bear the title or not, not in the past, not today. The only reason a duke might lose his title is if he dies or is accused and condemned of treason, then the next in line inherits. Case closed. It is akin to someone writing a novel set in 2019 where Barack Obama had been re-elected for a third term; if the law has not been changed, it cannot happen. I was hoping that it had been a mistake in the blurb, but unfortunately, it isn’t. The whole foundation of the story is built on quicksand. I find it disconcerting that, for an author of Marie Force’s stature, apparently no one cared enough to ensure that her novel was not based on a fallacy, when it would have taken only a few minutes of googling to fact-check first. The worst is that the story could have easily been written otherwise without fabricating this preposterous premise. The fact that Catherine was found by Derek – the duke – was entirely sufficient to make the romance happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writing is good, the pace is steady, and I was pleasantly surprised that I did not fine one single typo, although the book is riddled with inconsistencies of all sorts. The romance is fine although it happens much too quickly: there is instalust and instalove, which did not feel particularly realistic for 1902. However, it was easier to digest than the rake whose miraculous metamorphosis into a perfect gentleman happens literally within 5 minutes, which is the basis for a second – it was rushed but it was a clever plot twist, and because of that, again, the preposterous clause in the will could have been dispensed with. However, I was astonished that when Catherine learns that Derek has lied about being the estate manager, she does not give in to histrionics, and that the misunderstanding did not last for ages. This was handled much better than it usually is, even when it happens a second time. Because, of course, the first time Derek had forgotten to tell Catherine about the ludicrous “clause in the will”. The reason for Catherine’s presence on Derek’s estate – her quest – turned out to be entirely anticlimactic, which I thought was a shame because it could have been more fully exploited instead of the absurd premise of the will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine is a more interesting character than Derek, but my favourite was by far Simon – Derek’s cousin and friend. There are also several sex scenes, for the most part rather uninspired. DUCHESS BY DECEPTION is the first book in the Gilded series, which sounds more like a saga than the type of series we usually see, if I judge by the last pages.\n",

      "I was actually genuinely impressed by the quality of the sex scenes. They were steamy without being crude, and romantic without too much sighing or eye-gazing. The characters were pretty flat, but let's be honest, deep characterisation is not exactly why we read these sorts of books.\n",
      "\n",
      "But...but, but, BUT.. Zoe York has no idea how legal accessioning or the heritage industry works. None at all! I know that shouldn't have bothered me so much, but Cara, the protagonist literally had the job I did for most of my 20's. I'm a professional historian and I can tell you now, what Cara knows about historical conservation and preservation would have had her fired long before the events of this book.\n",

      "There are lots of Navy SEALs books out there, but what makes this one and others written by Zoe York stand out is her ability to breathe life into her characters and make them the kind of people you wish were your friends. They are charismatic, funny, sometimes flawed, but always romance worthy heroes and heroines.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked that this story featured characters that were entwined with the locale - in this case Cara who is an island native with that Caribbean heritage in her blood. She's desperate to make the plantation into a heritage site, and Mick's arrival to claim it for his friend Will as part of his inheritance puts a definite damper on her plans, notwithstanding the attraction she feels for the handsome retired navy man looking for a new purpose in life. As they come to know each other, they develop a friendship that leads to more (and some steamy scenes between them as a result). The issue of whose land it is remains the conflict through the story, but the point when they individually realize how much the other person's future means to them is where their affection for each other makes them look for a compromise. I enjoyed meeting Cara's friends (and Mick's also), which hopefully means some great new stories on the way! 4.5 stars.\n",

      "I am always a big fan of Faleena Hopkins and her Cocky series! This one was no different!! However, this one was a little deeper and darker with more intense issues, and brought to light the human condition and what parents will do to protect their children. Sean, a new recruit to the Ciphers MC has so much to prove not only to the group, but to himself as well. Everything is riding on his success with this group. He has had some hard times, that have changed the course of his life and it is time for healing and for positive change. Celia, born and raised in the Cipher household is a strong and trained young woman. She is fierce and brave, and understands the importance of helping others. When Sean arrives, she is part of the team that trains him in combat and weaponry. She has known love and freedom and toughness her whole life and has been fortunately raised in this house of deep family roots. She is set on helping Sean become a part of this family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sean and Celia have a connection that cannot be denied, but it is brought about through their ability to have empathy and compassion for each other. Their story is so beautifully written because it demonstrates how not only two people, but a family, can come together to heal another hurting member. The story demonstrates the strength of its members and how even the most unexpected of people can be the one who sets healing in motion. Sean and Celia both victims of circumstance find a way to heal not only themselves, but each other with an amazing love that blooms and spreads beautifully. The way the story unfolds is empowering and allows us to realize the importance of life and family and how easily life changing situations can be addressed positively with the needed strength and support from the family. This story, through the coming together of Sean and Celia, is beautiful and full of love. It is a page turner that has you wanting to know how it is going to turn out, not only for Sean and Celia, but for others as well. This is a must read for anyone who wants to read about empowerment and family love. Faleena, Kuddos to you!! I love how you bring serious issues to light in your books! Thanks. I read this voluntarily as an ARC for an honest review.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I have to say that I have not read one book in this series that was not a great story.  With that being said, this book is no different.  It is an amazing story with amazing characters.  Faleena Hopkins has created a family with the Cocker Series.  Not only with her books but with her fans as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this story Celia thinks she is in love with Atlas.  That is until Atlas snitches on his on brother Luke.  When  Luke is sent away, everyone is tense in the household.  Celia wants to be there for Atlas, but she still finds it hard to be ok with what he did.  When a new guy named Sean is introduced into the house, Celia's feelings start to change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sean is misunderstood.  He is always in trouble because he fights for those who can't fight for themselves.  Not understood by normies, he feels misplaced like an outsider.  That is until he meets the Ciphers.  When he is given the chance to try out for the MC, he jumps on it.  He will do what he must to become a Cipher, even if it means not acting on his feelings for the beautiful Celia.  But when secrets come out of the dark hiding spaces, his time with the MC may just be reaching an expiration date.  Can he prove he is worthy?\n",
      "\n",
      "This book was a pretty emotional book compared to some of the others.  I always like reading about Jett and his MC family.  They are brave and strong.  They live by their own code and help those who can't help themselves.  The characters may be tough on the outside, but deep down they are soft and kind.  They love deeply.  Wonder if we will get Atlas's story one day.\n",

      "FATE SETS A COURSE TO TRUE-LOVE\n",
      "\n",
      "Fate sometimes has a way of setting your life in the right direction and such is the case with Sean; abused as a youngster and instead of becoming belligerent he chose the route of sticking up for the ones that cannot do this on their own. His lifestyle earns him points to have a trial period with the Ciphers' Club. This is his chance for a better life and being able to do what he knows best; a protector. Celia is a beauty and notices Sean upon his arrival as does Sean notice her. Celia becomes one of his trainers and he has many moments when he wants to pull her aside for the whirlpool of desires he holds for her but keeping his head in the training game is pivotal; he must be voted into the Ciphers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soul-Stirring fabulous well-written read that keeps you intrigued until the conclusion. I absolutely loved Sean's honesty, loyalty, and protectiveness; Sean is twice the hero and Celia is definitely a force to be reckoned with. A few twists and moments that tug your heart, action, witty-banter makes you smile and laugh and the romance is fiery passionate. I do so love the camaraderie and family atmosphere among the Ciphers and wish I could join them on their adventures. I found this to be impressive and entertaining; loved it and I await the next book. A fantastic choice for your library if you enjoy fast-paced adventurous romance. Without reservations, I recommend this read.\n",

And no, making your character admit that she shouldn’t had done that doesn’t make her less of an idiot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cherry on the cake for me was for Kate to acuse a guy of rape when he didn’t do it, while covering for the actual rapist, making him an innocent, what about the families of the real victims? You’re making them believe that a guy that didn’t do anything murdered their loved ones. What about rape victims that aren’t believed, and here you are a JOURNALIST lying about being raped because you’re useless and needs your stepfather to find you a job.\n",

In some stories, this style makes for an intriguing story that keeps us guessing. This style, however, didn't work for me with this book. It was pretty obvious from the get go what happened and when we finally get the whole story - at a very odd time might I add - it felt kinda laughable, honestly.\n",

      "I am so sad to see this series end. It really doesn't have to! There are still so many stories that they could create! Please, please, please! Or maybe write a spin-off series??? Something!! That's the end of my fangirl moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taken by Fire is mainly the story of Stryker. He has such a cool power, he can affect basically earth, so watch out you don't piss him off or you may cause an earthquake! He is assigned to kill Melanie/Phoebe, the chick with two personalities that killed Akbar in the forest at the end of the last book. He watched as his friend burned in front of him, so this mission is personal for him. He wants to squeeze the life out of her!\n",
      "\n",
      "Except once he finds her she explains to him about her dual personality. Can he believe her? There are actually two people living inside her body thanks to an Itor experiment, Phoebe is the bad one, and Melanie is the good one. Phoebe is out most of the time and has abused Melanie for a long time. Phoebe is the Itor agent, Melanie doesn't know anything. They each have a different power, Phoebe is fire, Melanie is ice. And yes, they find out that she's Alek's daughter (head of Itor), which of course makes Dev change his plans and decide to just bring her in, not kill her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She needs sex to recharge her powers and when they find themselves in a situation where he needs her to get them out of a bind, he is the only choice for sex. After that first time, which was rough, she admits that even though her body might've not been, she was actually a virgin, and yes, Oz's prediction comes back to mind\n",
      "\n",
      "He quickly starts developing feelings for Melanie, and after those first few rushed times, which were still pretty hot, there's more of a connection between them. Can I just say that even though this book was just a tad less creative in the sex department, at least with the main characters, they still had some hot scenes. They joined the mile high club and almost brought down the plane with both their powers; the back of an SUV after playing and training with her powers; he sits down at the kitchen table to have dessert *THUD*\n",
      "\n",
      "So yeah, I liked the main characters in this one. I felt bad for Melanie, I hated Phoebe she was a total bitch! And let me warn you, Phoebe does get a little rough and there might be some scenes where you can't believe they went that far with what she was allowed to do, but that was still ok with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let me get to my favorite characters of ACRO. In every book, Creed&Annika and Dev&Gabe&Oz were also reason enough for me to keep reading. Their side storylines are amazing in my opinion. I did feel a lack of Creed and Annika in this book, we didn't get a lot of time with them and I missed them. Annika is pregnant, Creed is stressing out about Oz's vision that she would die if she has his child, Annika is pissed at Stryker for sleeping with Akbar's killer. But we didn't see a lot of Creed/Annika time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dev... He was my favorite character in this book! He is so intense, emotionally raw and devastatingly hot! Gabe is actually more the romantic and wants more from Dev than a booty call. Dev has to learn to cope with that and to give Gabe what he needs while still dealing with the takedown of Itor and his newly found sister(s) in ACRO's custody. Some of the best sex, and almost sex scenes in this book are Dev & Gabe's. Oh.My.Gawd!!!!!! HAWT! That's all I got to say. You have to read it! And yes, there is a threesome in this one! Oz gets to have a body for just one night!!!! *THUD*\n",
      "\n",
      "The last two or three chapters of this book had me in tears... constantly. I cried for everyone! I'm tearing up again now. It seemed like there would be no resolutions or happy endings for anybody, and my heart was breaking. It was a great ending! Full of emotion, full of action. The ACRO family is all there. But I still don't want it to end! I can't let go!\n",

      "Oh boy, what a fantastic ride this series was, and what a perfect ending for it. I loved EVERY freaking page of Taken by Fire. This book was definitely the master piece of the series, totally exceed every other book in it. The ACRO series was outstanding and so different from all the other series in this genre.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book was just sublime, and it finally gave us a closure to all that had been developing since book 1, a flawless closure by the way. It just could't have gone any better than it did. I freaking cried with this book, which is something that hasn't happened to me with a book since so long I can't even remember the last time it happened. So many truths get revealed, so many lives get at risk, and the plot just couldn't help to get even better than what it already was... So how are we suppose not to ADORE this book? If you guys liked the previous books in this series you're gonna LOVE this one. This series has been growing on me with each new book and after the last couple of books I just got addicted to it, but nothing had prepared me for the amazing time I had reading this last book. PERFECTION. Sigh, I just wish this series didn't have to end but it really was the perfect ending and another book would just ruin that. So I will congratulate both authors to be able to realize the perfect timing to finish it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this last installment we get to read about Stryker and Phoebe/Melanie. I must admit I had been dying to read about this 2 characters for way too long, I just adored them both since we met them in the previous books. Both characters are amazing on their own, from their personalities to their reactions. But together they are even better, they had a great chemistry. Then we get to read about Dev and how he finally got his well deserved HEA. We also get a little glimpse of every single character we met in the previous books. This book has everything it needs to keep you glued to the chair. Sigh. I'll miss this series so much, it really had something different from all the rest, which was what I adored the most about it. I just know I wont be able to find it anywhere else. 10 points for originality.\n",

      "I don’t know how Marian did it, but she drew me into this trilogy without me even knowing it. I truly enjoyed this series. It was funny, sexy, and hot. I purchased the first installment when it was free back in February. I just started reading it April 1 and I was so eager to find out about Yanny and Constantijin that by Tuesday night I purchased ($6.00) and finished both copies that same night. That’s how much I enjoyed reading the story. Now, that’s not my usual M.O. I usually stalk the free copies list for novels but I couldn’t resist this story. I enjoyed Yanny’s humor and she is probably one of the few women I know that has great self-control. I mean, Constantijin put her in some hot situations but she stayed strong. I also fell in love with alpha male Constantijin. I liked that Marian portrayed him as a true playboy and didn’t change him to “boyfriend” material early in the story. You actually get a chance to see him grow into boyfriend material. Marian also included some different twist and turns that I haven’t read in other erotic-romance books. I will admit the last book “Caged” did leave me with a few questions I wish Marian had answered so maybe she may right another story about Yanny and Constantijin. But then again, the book does have some supporting characters that may need to find love.\n",

      "How Not to be Seduced by Billionaires is probably one of the cutest stories I’ve read in a while. It has such an enjoyable light hearted feel to it. I know not one woman can say that they would not want to be pursued by a very rich, young, attractive man, so this just became every woman’s fantasy read. Marian is so good at writing anticipation, she brings you right to the edge of a cliff but never lets you go over. Multiple times I was holding my breath, chanting in my head do it or don’t do it, to the point I actually gave myself a headache. Whereas some of Marian’s other stories were a bit longer, this one was roughly 100 pages, which I wished would have been longer but worked for the story. With every story that I read by Marian, she has become an author I am sure to follow.\n",

      "So about the story, Yanna is a young 24 year old woman trying to get a job at a multi-million dollar company. Upon arriving for her interview, she is late and stands out like a sore thumb in a pink suit. Taking one of the last available seats, she unknowingly sits down next to the CEO, Constantijin Kastein. That my friends is just the beginning. Standing out is what gets her the job. She has caught the attention of her new employer and not just for her excellent skills, but her looks as well. Unskilled in the art of love warfare, Constantijin begins his intense seduction techniques on Yanna and is intent on getting her in his bed. Throughout this story you will find out more about Yanna’s fate with Constantijin. Will she give in to his seduction and give him what he wants most or will she hold out until he gives her what she wants most, his heart. Find out when you read this enjoyable story. Enjoy \n",

      "I definately did not see this coming! This is a short little snap of a story that starts out strong and has an even stronger finish. It was a short read but definately a good one.\n",
      "When I started reading this, I thought, ok this is so a 50 Shades of something kind of book. I was wrong. This book started out with a bang. I really enjoyed the characters in this book. Yanna had an endearing quality about her. She knew that Constantijin was her boss and she couldn't break the no office relationship code of conduct, but everything in her body told her that she wanted to. But it was more than evident that he wanted it to... Constantijin (just for the record, I have no idea how to say that I just called him Constant while reading the book), the filthy rich billionaire was a strong character and hot, oh my goodness whas he hot... Without revealing too much of this story, I will say, I loved it. It was short but complex enough to keep me interested. I was a bit angry when the book actually ended. I needed more. The sexual tension in this book was unbelievable and there was plenty of it...\n",
      "This book had great characters, although I think that Arian could have been left completely out of it and it wouldn't have mattered except for the jealousy factor and all great romances have to have the jealousy factor right? Because of the length of the book, I was a tad diappointed that we didn't get to learn more about George. Or what happened back at the office after the final presentations. I was left with several unanswered questions, but an unbelievable ending that left me with my mouth wide open.\n",
      "It was a great quick read and I am looking forward to reading more of Marian Tee's books in the future. This one was so worth it, I only wish it had been longer.\n",

      "2.0 RATING- You know how you can come across a book that has semi-good ratings/reviews and after reading it leaves you questioning if everyone's lost their freaking mind? Yep, that's this book for me. I'm wondering if we've all gone dodo for alphas and will accept the crappiest books as acceptable to meet our bossy/dominator quota. This was just not good. At all. If I hear anyone else call someone \"lover\" I'm going to cut a bitch. That's because that word appears 156 times in this book. No lie. I checked. I'm not sure how others are rating it so high but this just didn't work for me at all. I won't be reading more from this author.\n",

      ", this author was not playing, when she sat down to write an erotic novel. From start to end this book was dripping of pure and raw sex, my eyes started to hurt at one point and it felt like they were . That's how often Evvie and Brett wanted each other. The first chapter pretty much sets the tone and pace for the whole book, and the intense chemistry between Brett and Evvie. I have not rated a book D.R.I.P in a long time and this book was well deserving of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to start by saying what an opening that greets the reader. Brett was scary intense, but I like his kind of scary in my reads now and then, aggressive, sexy and rough around the edges. Not everyone can do aggressive well and not over do it. Brett's character is the owner of a bar. He likes things done his way and he has flirting down to a science. I loved the way he flirted aka made attempts in temping Evvie. Evvie is breaking into her own. She has over protective brothers, hence, no boyfriends in her life. The relationship between Evvie and Brett was intense, troubled and as quickly as it started, is as quickly as trouble followed. I do a admit that their romance was quick but it fit the story and what the author was doing with the characters, showing the possessiveness and crazy attraction Evvie and Brett had.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, now, I will play devil's advocate in a paragraph. I enjoyed this story, however, for some readers, they might find the continuous sex over bearing and a bit much. Sometimes the sex took over the plot of the story, but not all the time. You will either love this story and its characters or you will not be impress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, a good read for my personal taste. I was never bored and was truly entertained from start to finish. However, I am not a fan majority of the time of a continuous series with the same characters, so let's see how the author concludes Evvie and Brett's story in Torn book 2.\n",

      "This was a good, quick, sweet and sexy story. I guess you could call it a second chance romance that happens between Wanda (Not my favourite name) and Mac. Their relationship literally starts the moment she gets out of her car and picks up quickly. I enjoyed this story for what it was, a quick and sweet read. If I think about it to hard I begin to pick it apart with some questions. I wanted to know more about Max, get his POV. Wanda was a virgin but we knew nothing of Mac's past other than he wasn't one. I wanted to know if he cared enough about her to tattoo her first initial on his neck why didn't he confess his feelings to her, a tattoo is a forever commitment. Why was he with other women if he felt so strongly about the h? This is just me nitpicking but I wish I had the answers.\n",

      "I don't even have words for how freaking cute this novella was. I honestly felt super skeptical because I didn't think I'd be into alien romance as a subgenre (this was my first... unless you count weird fanfics I read as a kid), and yeah, I mean, the description of Mitteeku with his scales and spikes and all — well, I wasn't swooning over the visual, but that really doesn't matter because he is so precious and an absolute treasure!\n",
      "\n",
      "I seriously don't remember the last book that made me laugh out loud this much. Whether it's Mitteeku's struggles with translations and adapting to human life, or his bewilderment at the toddler's \"bloodthirst\" RE: stuffed animals, or the fact that THE BABY STARTS TO MIMIC HIS GROWLS?? I'm giggling just thinking back on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you're open to alien romance, and looking for a hilarious and sweet Christmas novella, I highly recommend this one. I had such a fun time reading it and I can 100% see myself picking up more of Amanda Milo's works in the very near future. Thank you to Sionna for recommending this one to me! ♥♥\n",

      "\n",
      "This was an adorable and hilarious fish out of water story of an alien who finds a place in a single mother’s household. It’s delightful, charming and heartwarming, if a bit loose on detail. I think perhaps had I read some of the rest of this series I may have had more info on this race of care taker aliens, as it was, I did have to suspend my belief a lot and be ok with many unanswered questions. But the dialogue and cuteness offset those issues and overall this was a good little Christmas story.\n",

      "A fluffy and funny alien holiday treat. You have to suspend some disbelief at how quickly the h accepts an alien in her yard and as a nanny, but this book was filled with sweetness and light. The kids are cute, the relationship is slowly developed with no angst, and there’s just enough romance with a touch of steam. Lots of great details and cultural differences like the H and the toddler growling, how he cooks their food, and when the H gets protective. The epilogue does jump ahead a bit and has them in their HEA, safe and happy as a family. Written in first person, dual POV. No ow/om drama (h’s ex isn’t in the picture), h is not a virgin and H is a virgin, pull-out method.\n",

      "Imagine if Mary Poppins showed up at your door, but she was a giant red alien with horns and a tail...Completely OTT, but with this story it not only works, but is funny, heartwarming, and a bit sexy.\n",

      "90% of what makes this story so delightful to me is Mitteeku, the alien MC. He is my catnip; sweet, caring, funny, strong, and completely devoted to heroine (and her children). As with author Milo's other aliens, Mitteeku is a loving nurturer who is exquisitely gentle and unfailingly kind. His interactions with the heroine's children are by turns funny and touching.\n",

Borrowed the book using Kindle Unlimited and found that it needed better editing. Neither character grabbed me. Actually, I didn't really enjoy any of the main and secondary characters in this novel. Heroine came off as whiny and passive-aggressive when she should have just been upfront to the guy. Hero's instantaneous turnaround on his stance regarding fatherhood wasn't justified for me. The hero went as far as doing a vasectomy, that says to me he's very hardcore against parenthood; so a gradual change in his feelings towards parenthood would have been more in-line.\n",

I did enjoy the first person voice of Emily as it meant as a reader I knew her thoughts however the lack of background meant I didn’t particularly get sucked into this book.

Not to mention how easily she adjusts to her captivity and does not a one thing to question her kidnapping and denial from ever returning to her outside world. Please, please just create a character already that will look at everything that “suddenly” happens to her and says: “Ew! Oh hell no! This is so not how things are gonna go down.” For the love of all our mothers and their mothers went through to gain recognition on this man dominated world, just create a heroine with some back-bone already.\n",

      "The more we understand about the genesis of violence, the harder it is to draw a clear line between guilt and innocence, sanity and insanity. We, as a society of thinking and feeling human beings, struggle within ourselves to cope with competing interests and motivations: the need for protection from dangerous people, sane or insane; the desire for revenge; the knowledge of the psychobiological and environmental influences on violent behavior; and the wish to adapt evolving standards of decency and morality. Guilt was a lot easier to measure before we recognized that free will, like sanity and insanity, is a constantly fluctuating intellectual and emotional continuum and not a fixed, immutable capacity or state of mind. In response to our struggles to strike balances between what we feel we'd like to do to people who commit grotesque acts of violence no matter what their mental state, and what we think perhaps we ought to do and ought not to do, jurisdictions have swung back and forth, changing from one definition of insanity to another, then back to the first, often in response to a sensational case of the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am extremely interested in the reason we believe some of the crazy things we believe and ultimately do some of the horrible things we do. This fascination has led me to read any number of true crime books in conjuction with books that explore the biological and environmental basis for behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lewis' book seems to fall firmly in the middle of those two genres. Partly a true crime book, it is also a summary of her extensive career, which has led her to interview many famous and many not so famous killers and which often times describes even if only in general detail the cases. The book is a fascinating read if only for the questions its author raises about the nature of violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lewis seems to believe that only a \"crazy\" person could commit the grizzly crimes her clients/patients on death row (patients like Ted Bundy and Arthur Shawcross) have committed. Unfortunately, being crazy isn't the same thing as being insane, at least not in the eyes of the US legal justice system. And therein lies the meat of her narrative. How do we deal with violent criminals in a way that acknowledges the mitigating circumstances (often mental illness consistent with a psychiatrists definition of insane even if not with the law's interpretation) that often leads to the most vile and heinous crimes, without feeling as though by doing so we've let them literally get away with murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also some interesting evidence presented for the existence of multiple personality disorder, which I know isn't universally taken seriously, but that was still worth reading as her experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though I don't agree with all her arguments and feel as if she was a little too quick to arrive at certain conclusions (after all, she was generally hired to find mitigating circumstances for the purpose of having a death row sentence revoked), I still felt this was a fascinating read. Many of the questions she raises about our views of violent criminals and our inability or rather reluctance as a society to accept that freewill isn't this concrete, tangible, or well-defined human attribute is well stated. This idea that we would all be capable and even likely to become murderers given the right combination of biological and environmental conditions seems a no-brainer, yet still we execute people insisting it is a deterrent to these ghastly crimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beneath all the neuropsychological meanderings is a valid and poignant discussion of the death penalty which culminates when Lewis interviews an executioner, who she quickly paints as being more like the men he helps to kill than he might realize.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an aside, some of her clients' histories (many clients were children at the time they committed the murders and were sentenced to death) were beyond shocking and heartbreaking. The extent of abuse inflicted on these kids--physical, emotional, sexual--is sickening. The idea that these things are allowed to happen is a sad comment on our society. We spend weeks and months and years not only talking about terrorist attacks but waging war on these would be invaders...which don't get me wrong is understandable, yet we somehow forget about all the children that are tortured and terrorized by our own citizens right in front of us. I'm sure if someone tallied up the number of Americans or even humans around the world directly affected by terrorism from some extremist group and those affected by unspeakable abuse (terrorism) from their mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, neighbors, and trusted community leaders, the numbers wouldn't even be in the same ballpark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good stuff for those interested in this sort of thing.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Throughout my legal career I wound up working with a numberof convicted sex offenders and discovered some startling similarities (besides the offence itself). One of those was a history of familial violence and sex abuse. I remember thinking \"this can't be a coincidence.\" Although I have had nothing to do with violent killers, I recognised the same patterns that Dorothy Lewis was highlighting in this book. Lewis found herself working with violent murderers - both youngsters who snapped and went on a rampage and serial killers, who tend to go about things in a far more methodical way.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two main mental disorders explored in this fascinating book. The first is one that has been dismissed as hokum by most psychiatrists: multiple personality disorder. The second details Lewis's search for a true sociopath, someone who hurts people with no remorse or compunction for no apparent reason. What she found is, in my view, much more disturbing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the point Lewis is making is that happy, well-adjusted people do not commit violent crimes, only \"crazy\" people do. Therefore most, if not, all violent criminals are, to some extent, insane. They are guilty by reason of insanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found the book fascinating and disturbing. I truly sympathised with Lewis as I know what it is like to work in a field where you are confronted with disturbing cases that are nevertheless fascinating, a field which can easily destroy relationships and consume the lives of the unwary. I heartily recommend this book to anyone as Lewis has a masterful ability to break down difficult concepts in an interesting way. She is also unflinching in her description, in some parts I found myself simultaneously engrossed and disturbed.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A fascinating and disturbing book, by a shrewd and compassionate doctor who has made it her life's work to study human violence and violent humans. The author uses her experiences in a number of cases to tell, in a matter-of-fact way, how she and a colleague learned important things about the human mind and soul, and had to unlearn much of what they had been taught in medical school.\n",
      "As a psychotherapist myself, I find that this is one of the most interesting and informative books I've read. I also find that her conclusions about her patients are different from, but compatible with,\n",
      "much of what I learned in working with a similar group of clients, first as adolescents whose lives were wrecked by family violence and mental illness and then later in the psychiatric hospital serving the state prison system.\n",
      "Powerful, strongly opinionated about both violent criminals and the legal and penal systems, and hard to put down. I challenge anyone who views issues like capital punishment or the role of insanity in deciding guilt as clear and simple to read this book.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I am conflicted with this one. It is somewhere between two and three stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the books defence it was written over ten years ago. Psychology and understanding has continued to develop since then. It may have been a better read when it was first written.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I didn't like about the book is that the author never considers the possibility that the prisoners that she interviews are not completely telling the truth. In a different novel, regarding the son of Sam, the interviewer then tells SoS \"to cut the crap\" (in regards to multiple personalities now DID) and to his amazement he did. There are some motives to lying in these interviews and I had my doubts about some of the cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interviews are summaries..some are phrased in the interviewee dialect but then switch to clinical dialect when describing more upsetting scenes such as rape. The problem with this is it made it seem less genuine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a interesting read in its own respect, especially if you want to learn more about why people might torture and kill. But take the information with a pinch of salt.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Dr. Lewis studies violence and its frequent roots in violent abuse and nerological damage. And her case stories are very interesting. And as her views evolve over her years of study and experience, she becomes an expert at trying to determine the \"why\" of appearingly senseless crimes. A very intense read.\n",

      "Lethal Letters is the 6th book in the 8-book Books By The Bay Mysteries series by Ellery Adams. This is by far my favorite book in the series so far! The plot was suspenseful, interesting and complex. While finding old letters and a time capsule that lead to a mystery is not a new plot device, I liked the creative way it was done in this book. It was a little bit of a different twist on an old standby with lots of suspects, twists and turns.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my reviews of previous books I have commented that this series annoys me a little bit because it's just a bit too much like women's fiction and I felt that got in the way of the mystery portion of the plot. And I felt previous stories concentrated too much time on the relationship between the main character and her boyfriend, and their sex life. There are only so many times I want to hear about her cop lover's nipples.... This cozy series has adult situations and sex in it a lot -- not graphic....just a bit more gettin' busy than is usually in a cozy mystery series. The series is definitely a blend of women's fiction and mystery. I prefer less women's fiction/romance and more mystery.... I was happy reading this book because it really stuck to task -- finding the killer and solving the mystery about a time capsule and letters -- and the romance portion was background character development. No descriptions of men's nipples! Hooray! (Now before any men get defensive and ask me if I have a problem with mipples.....I don't. I just want more mystery....less naked time. It gets a bit melodramatic when male characters are saying flowery love stuff that no male ever says outside a bad romance novel.... This time, the blend was a bit more even. I don't think I did any eyerolls at bad dialogue the entire time. Definitely my favorite book in the series so far!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd definitely say this series calls for some parental guidance if a child wants to read it. PG13 probably at least. Adult situations. Sex. Some cussing. Nothing over the top. Just a bit more adult stuff than is usually in a cozy series. But....this series makes up for it with complex plots and interesting characters.\n",

      "What can I say that I haven't already said about this wonderful and surprisingly good book series? I thought a certain arc was going to go in a predictable direction. But no, it made me go, oh thank you for surprising me book. Much appreciate it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the mystery, I kind of guessed one of the twists what with how much the characters learned as the story went along. Still from book 3 to this, a pretty good cozy series.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's what I like about the series, something is mentioned or foreshadowed and thus gets brought again, in the later books. Same with the characters moving forward but still going through their own arc as well. All the while trying to solve a mystery in their town. Oh and writing their book in their Bayside Writer's Club of course, can't forget that.\n",
      "\n",
      "And to think, the mystery in this, started off with the discovery of a time capsule. From there, events are thrown all over the place as Olivia and co figure how to solve this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh can I say that Rawlings in this and well throughout, has been a pretty likable, understanding and well just an awesome character? Dude is charming and you can see why Olivia falls for him. Near the end, I couldn't stop smiling. It was just too cute and I liked that we got a happy moment, what with throughout this one, it got a little sad and you felt bad for one or two characters who had to do with the mystery.\n",
      "\n",

Next up is a trip to the church to see Pastor Jeffries to make sure that all is ready there, too. When they arrive, they hear the sounds of jackhammers. As they are talking with the pastor, workmen bring in a box that turns out to be a time capsule. When it is opened, Pastor Jeffries gets a shocked look, packs everything back up and calls the head of the historical society, Bellamy Drummond. A day or two later while Olivia is helping Bellamy get the time capsules unveiling at The Secret Garden Party, a fundraiser for the historical society, she notices that item is suspiciously missing from the time capsule. Soon, while walking Haviland along the beach with her niece, she discovers the lifeless body of Ruthie Holcomb. Once Olivia learns of Ruthie's unfortunate past, she wants even more to find out what happened to this young lady.\n",

      "\n",
      "This book features Ivy, the firefighter and Vrex, the assassin for a favor. It’s a nice addition and I think Ms Hart does well with her proactive, independent heroines. Vrex is your standard tortured but really sweet and stoic type. Their story helps to expand the ‘verse even more. The only quibble is the romantic tension is reliant on the lack of communication, which was...fine. You know, it didn’t float my boat or sink my battleship. But I’m in it for the heroines getting to see each other again so I’m ready for the next book.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Ivy was awesome, and Vrex was a big ol' sweetie pie. I'm a total sucker for the misunderstood, strong, silent type whose all gruff and tough and just needs a little love to soothe his tortured soul, and that was Vrex to a T. I could have used a little more backstory or building of his character in other books so I could see how he had earned his badass reputation, because he just seemed like a big softie for most of this book. Still loved him though.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were also a few timeline inconsistencies that irked me, but they were pretty easy to overlook. Though this didn't wow me as much as 2 and 3, I still thoroughly enjoyed it and stayed up until 3am to finish it. Considering how tired I am today, that's saying something.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved all Ivy's quotes from The Art of War as well! So awesome.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I wanted to like this more than I did. This is a classic case of a badass male (Vrex) finally getting his own story and suddenly he's in touch with his feelings. It didn't feel genuine to me.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "We saw a bit of Vrex in the last book, I wasn't sure what to think of him, other than he could probably find Ivy with no issues. And that is just what he did. Like most of the other guys Vrex was a bit stunned with Ivy, she didn't act like any of the other females he knew, wasn't scared of him, talked to him, slowly won him over. I liked that each was smitten with the other, but hated how they got pulled apart. In the end though Ivy learned that Vrex was really into her and did what he could to make sure she was safe and that her life on this planet would be a good one.\n",

      "So amazing!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope! You’re so awesome! I spoke to Hope on her Facebook page and she confirmed the stories will continue! I just had to leave this message to the diehards like myself! The Arcav series isnt over either! These stories are truly amazing! I loved ivy and Vrez story. So sweet and she being a fire fighter and me working in EMS my whole life hits close to home. Especially since I remember when 9/11 happened and going to work during that tragic time. I’m so glad I discovered Hopes books. She has definitely put a smile on my face during a time I truly needed it most. Ptsd is a bitch and reading her books has let me escape and laugh and smile again. Her stories give me hope. No pun there, but it’s true. Her world building, her humor and just the way she writes let’s your imagination just run wild with her stories and you can just put a voice and color to everything she describes. She’s amazing. I’ll leave it at that.\n",

      "Saved by the Rancher by Jennifer Ryan\n",
      "\n",
      "Saved by the Rancher is the first book in Jennifer Ryan’s The Hunted series, and my first read of this author. The story starts out with a horrific scene of physical abuse, and Jenna Caldwell Merrick running for her life. This scene is definitely not pretty to read due to the viciousness of the attack, but this is Jenna's life and it's on the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "David Merrick is one of the wealthiest men alive and is used to getting what he wants, so when Jenna gets tired of the abuse and leaves him, he takes great pleasure in hunting her, and doing whatever he has to do to get her back. Intimidation, fear, abuse... he'll stop at nothing, but when those things don’t work, he’s more than willing to kill her. David is a sick SOB and loves seeing Jenna's fear, knowing he has the physical strength and the money to make her suffer.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re introduced to Jenna at the lowest point in her life. She’s come close to death too many times at David’s hands, but she won’t let him scare her into going back. She’ll run until she’s free or dead, but she won’t give up. Jenna has several safety nets in place to help her avoid being found, but time after time, he somehow tracks her down. With the help of her attorney, Jenna finally finds a place to hide, a place to rest, with people who are willing to protect her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jack Turner gets a call from an old college friend, as it turns out, to help hide a client. Jack doesn’t know this upfront, but it quickly becomes clear that this pretty lady who’s obviously been abused needs his help. Jack hasn’t been interested in a relationship in years because the women he's dated are always more into his wallet than they are into him. But there’s something about Jenna that draws him to her, and he can’t fight the attraction, and neither can she. But can Jack really keep Jenna safe and convince her to settle down with him when all she wants to do is run? He’s not sure of the answer to that, but he’s not willing to give up without a fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "is an entertaining story and, with a little more attention to editing, flow and pacing, could have been a 4 or 5 star read. What really kept the story from reaching that level is, considering all the abuse Jenna has endured, how long she’s run, how often she’s nearly died, I felt that her relationship development with Jack was rushed. We were told how afraid she was, how untrusting of men and unwilling to settle down, and yet, we didn't see that in the story because it was no time at all before she was having sexual feelings for Jack. It’s a full length novel so there was plenty of time to flesh it out, to allow that attraction to grow, and that would have made the story and the romance much more enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would probably label this a romantic suspense/thriller, given the brutality and abuse Jenna suffers at David’s hands, as well as the psychological game of cat and mouse he enjoys playing. This is an intense read, nothing light and fluffy about it because of that constant fear of Jenna being discovered in the back of your mind. The plot is exciting, fast paced, and steamy, and there times I couldn’t turn the pages fast enough to find out what might happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "series has the potential to be amazing, and I’m looking forward to reading more by Ms. Ryan.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.5 stars\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I was going to be generous and give this one two stars but I just can't, in good conscience, do it...\n",
      "\n",
      "So Jenna used to be married to David. He was abusive so she divorced him. She got half the shares in his company and a large sum of money in the divorce and that never set well with David. So in the true spirit of abusive book husbands, he hunts her down and attacks her when he finds her. After one particularly brutal attack, she takes off again and ends up at a ranch in Colorado. Jack is the ranch owner. She's in obviously poor shape and when he finds her unconscious, he mends her wounds and nurses her back to health. They fall in love. David finds her at the ranch and attacks her again. She then gets her revenge on David and Jenna and Jack live happily ever after.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to start by saying that I was enjoying this book until the 50% mark. The first half of the book, she was the normal, skittish, abused woman. She can't trust and she's very private and all that. So she shows up at the ranch 4 days after the latest attack on her and she spends a couple days in semiconsciousness. So it's been less than a week after this brutal attack. In the last two years since she's been on the run, David has found her numerous times and attacked her. Evidently he has the power to make medical records disappear and all sorts of other crazy power so she can't go to the police when she's attacked. She found a lawyer on the internet and he's been helping her stay as hidden as possible since she's been on the run. (The whole finding a lawyer online and never meeting with him in person is more than a bit suspect, especially for a woman in her situation, but whatever. She gives this lawyer complete control of her money and pretty much her entire life.) So anyway, she's known Jack a couple days and it's been less than a week since she was brutally attacked, yet she's falling hard for Jack. REALLY??? Then less than two weeks after the attack, she's still raw, literally and figuratively, yet she suddenly turns into Oprah or some shit. She takes Jack's sister and niece on a shopping spree (that they need a private jet for since they go shopping in Denver, which is a 6 hour drive from the ranch) and then she starts doling out property, houses, cars, and trust funds all around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shoot me now... The entire second half of the book is full of Jack and Jenna: \"...I love you so much...you're my world...I can't live without you...You're safe now. He'll never touch you again...I hate that you've been through this...Am I hurting you?...I love you so much...You make me so happy...my world lit up when you came into my life...I don't know what I'd do without you...\" Over. And over. And OVER again! It was CONSTANT!!! And she replayed her \"Hell\" with David repeatedly. The writing irritated the crap out of me because it was like the author wanted there to be angst, but it wasn't really angsty. And then it's like she was bored with a particular scene or something so she just cut it off and jumped forward a couple weeks or months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, when David shows up at the ranch, she's by the house and he's in the tree line and there are security guards on the property. Instead of her running inside the house (that she's standing right next to) or calling out for help from the security guards, she crosses the yard in silence and enters the tree line to go with him. I lost my sympathy for the dumbass bitch at that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then suddenly she's evidently a business genius. She was going to college for a graphic design and programming degree (I wasn't aware that was a degree option) but she didn't finish college because David made her quit going in the 6 months she was married to him. That does not qualify someone to run a business empire. AND she's 26 with absolutely no business world experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was Jack's 3 year old niece who talked like an adult half the time, but like a child the other half of the time. Here's just PART of a really long monologue from the 3 year old: \"...And I got a jeep. It's in the car. You have to put it together. Then, we had a really fancy lunch, and we came home on the jet again. See my new dress and my shiny new shoes. Aren't they pretty? Jenna bought them for me. Not only this, she bought me play clothes too and toys. I like the Jeep the best though. Will you put it together now?\" SERIOUSLY??? Has this lady NEVER met a three year old??? I have two kids and they are both exceptionally intelligent and have always been well-spoken (my son's first word was 'tractor' when he was 8 months old) and they were speaking in simple, but complete sentences before the age of three. I've been around three year olds who could hardly be understood at all and others who spoke quite well. Even still, three year olds don't talk that that. And it was like that ALOT in this book and it drove me CRAZY!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are things that just don't add up. At the beginning, Jack's sister says she's pregnant and due in five months (February 1st). That would put the timing at about September. So three months later when she's planting flowers around the house (in the Colorado mountains), I was beyond confused! Then, it says she came to the ranch in July, but even then planting flowers in October in the Colorado mountains would be ridiculous. And then there's David's new wife who he refers to as Patricia more than once and then refers to her as Meredith...\n",
      "\n",
      "The writing drove me insane. I started skimming after 50% because the story REALLY got annoying. Jenna wasn't remotely believable as a battered woman. Jack was borderline Neanderthal. I'm not talking just alpha male. I'm talking dumb jock one minute and then former Army Ranger smart guy the next and then \"I am caveman, hear me roar\" the next. I think he actually said that at one point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes I wonder if authors have ever had conversations with other people or sat and observed how other people communicate with each other, because the characters in books don't have normal conversations. So I really wonder if some of these authors just read other books and think this is really how people communicate since they don't have any interpersonal relationships of their own to know otherwise. It gets to be rather annoying.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of the story was good and I was hopeful. There was just A LOT of totally awful things about the writing that ruined it for me. Considering I was so bored and over the constant reassurances to each other and Jenna's constantly worrying about whether her mysterious plan to get back at David would work, I was skimming half the story which is NEVER a good thing... I'm a book lover and I absolutely LOVE to read! Skimming does NOT make me happy...\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I'm going to sound like I can't decide if I like this book or not. Well, that's because there were parts I liked a lot and others that had me raising my eyebrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, what I liked. It's romantic suspense involving cowboys on a ranch and a heroine on the run from a truly diabolical ex-husband. Jenna's fear was well earned and one of the most chilling aspects of the book is when we experience the attacks from her point of view. It was horrific, awful and scary. When she lands at Jack's ranch, I breathed a sigh of relief on her behalf. He and his family were just good people and even though it could be sappy at times, they were a wonderful respite, embracing the battered Jenna and nursing her back to health. If you're in the mood for a sweet romance and small town friendly, this story really works...a great dog, cute 3-year old and a cranky horse all add to the \"feel good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, what made me roll my eyes at times. This is truly an \"insta-love\" that just developed too quickly and it didn't have to. There was a clear and natural path that could have been taken to more slowly evolve the romance but...for some reason it was necessary to have Jenna and Jack speed things up. It was annoying. Then, there was one instance where Jenna's ex got access to her that really stretched credulity. I just rejected the entire scene it was so far off base. Lastly, the number of errors in the book was unacceptable. It was poorly edited by a major publisher. I'm used to reading uncorrected proofs with fewer errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bottom line, though, is I was completely hooked by the story because when it was good, it was very, very good. When it was bad, it wasn't terrible. I liked the story, characters, ranch setting, suspense and the set up for the next books in the series, which I will definitely be continuing. They sound even better.\n",

      "I have dearly loved this author and she is one of my top favorites when it comes to contemporary westerns. She mixes a combination of heart and sexy into her stories and they always work for me and I have been wanting to get to her backlisted books, and this one is part of one of her first series. I think I have had Saved by the Rancher on my wishlist for years, almost a decade now. I picked this one up on a whim, as I saw it available in audio on my libby app and I am so happy I grabbed this one. I was instantly hooked and I was able to listen to this one in less than a day. That is not my norm for audiobooks unless I am really into it. Jennifer Ryan worked her magic here and there is such a beautiful blend of endearing characters and heart in the romance. The familial connections were great and the heroine is a badass when its needed. The hero is a protector and will do anything for his girl and the plot was on point! You definitely won’t go wrong if you enjoy reading contemporary westerns with a mix of suspense in the blend.\n",

      "Jenna Caldwell Merrick, is on the run from her ex-husband. She has never been able to live in peace since she married him, but with the help of her lawyer, she manages to keep on the run but he is always able to find her and lashes out his punishment. In her latest run-in with her ex, his beating was one of the worst ones. Her Lawyer and friend Ben, find her sanctuary with Jack Turner and his family. Jack first sees Jenna at the local restaurant and immediately knows that she is in trouble and in need of help, not realizing she is the woman their mutual friend Ben, requested he give a home to. When Jenna ends up passed out from infection, Jack uses everything from his military knowledge and tends to her wounds and he is determined to protect her no matter what. With Jack���s strength and love, Jenna works her way to being healed, but with Jack and his family’s support, Jenna will fight to reclaim her freedom and life against her ex-husband but will it come at a cost to the lives of Jenna and Jack…..\n",

      "\n",
      "Saved by the Rancher was such a breathtaking story and I adored every single moment. I just couldn’t put this audiobook down at all. It was such an endearing read and I just love the whole caretaking trope that is such a major element within the story. I was drawn to Jack and Jenna so fiercely. I really admired Jenna, while she has been abused and terrorized and we see the moments of the effect that can have on a person mentally, we also see such strength and playfulness in her character. Jenna hasn’t allowed her ex to break her spirit. She has such a generous spirit and can be a badass businesswoman when needed. She is smart, sassy, and sweet. Jack is a hero that is the perfect match. Jack served in the military but his days of being a medic still haunt him. He lives and breathes his quiet ranch life and hasn’t had an interest in a woman in years until he meets Jenna. She is like a breath of fresh air. The plot of the story is guaranteed to keep you on edge, I really enjoyed the way the plot developed, and seeing the way it kept me on my toes. The side characters were so endearing and I was so drawn into their lives and this story easily sweeps in and captivates your attention from the first chapter.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Saved by the Rancher is my first experience with Jennifer Ryan’s romantic suspense novels. After struggling through this book for over two weeks, I’ve concluded that her writing might not be for me. I found the story hard to consume and absolutely unrealistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jenna Caldwell Merrick has been hunted by her ex-husband, David Merrick, for over two years. David is accustomed to getting everything he wants, so when Jenna leaves him after a series of beatings and takes him for half of his wealth, he begins his hunt to reclaim her. Jenna is determined to escape his clutches and remains on the run. However, every time he finds her, he brings her to brink of death through brutal beatings and constant harassment.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a horrific incident that leaves Jenna beaten and broken, she flees to Stargazer Ranch in Colorado and is tended back to health by Jack Turner who owns the ranch. Immediately, these two character forge a romantic connection, and Jenna begins unfolding her plans to bring her ex-husband’s terror to an end.\n",
      "\n",
      "The romance between Jenna and Jack felt quite sudden and a bit over the top. I wasn’t convinced Jack fell in love with Jenna after only a few short days of contact where she was unconscious for most of that time. It would have worked better if the author had allowed more time to pass between the two, and possibly slow the romance down a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also struggled with the domestic abuse that occurred in this novel. How was Jack able to get away with it was beyond me!! Maybe I’ve watched one too many crime shows, but how about using DNA samples from scratches and defense wounds to convict Jack??? Also, there was a glaring mistake in the story that stood out to me. I thought when David remarried her name was Patricia but in the boardroom meeting he referred to her as Meredith. Did I miss something?\n",
      "\n",
      "On a positive note, I liked the secondary characters Caleb, Summer, Lily, and I enjoyed how Jennifer Ryan worked the ranch animals into the story, including the protective nature of Sally the golden retriever and Blue the volatile stallion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the story dragged on for over sixty chapters. I never felt any connection for the main characters, nor was I convinced with the romance between them because it came on too suddenly and overwhelmingly. Not what I hoped for.\n",

Initially, this skirted the line and I was worried that we might stray into questionable consent territory -nope, his overwhelming sexual mojo makes her forget all her qualms. Still, I wasn't happy that a HEA for them means she has to give up everything she's built. My other issue was that there wasn't much else going on storywise in the background, so at the heart this is just sexy times in a thin story wrapper.\n",

      "Alexandra Ivy has a new paranormal series out and it is hot. I went into her new Dragons of Eternity series expecting a good paranormal romance. Burned by Darkness is definitely hotter with the sexy than her Guardians of Eternity books. I’m totally on board with that. Baine is a very cocky dragon. He also happens to be a dragon that is beyond possessive about his treasured horde. The items of his horde vary from gold and gems to priceless works of art and musty old books and of course his missing imp, Tayla. There is no mistaking his ownership of Tayla. He reminds her often that he bought her fair and square.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tayla has other thoughts about the dragon, many of them. While running and hiding from him for the past twenty five years she has had plenty of time to think. Tayla simply wants to bake and run her precious teahouse. Things are simple until Baine finds her. Then her thoughts turn to all the things she wants him to do to her and with her and how to keep themselves busy in his bed, never his harem. That’s the problem though. She knows that the arrogant dragon is using his dragon magic to get what he wants and what he wants is her.\n",
      "\n",
      "While chest pounding Neanderthals are nothing any sane woman would want in real life, in book escapes they make for uber sexy characters. Bane is that possessive ass that is complete book boyfriend material. His knuckle dragging ways get him in so much trouble where Tayla is concerned. Baine is completely oblivious how to actually woo a woman. He’s a dragon the ultimate in hotness. He just assumes Tayla should recognize it for what it is and fall at his feet like all other women. Tayla can’t deny the attraction and desire she has for Baine. She can however make him work at winning her heart though.\n",

      "Alexandra Ivy is an author new to me in as much that I have not read any of her work previous to Burned by Darkness, but as an author in general, she is one that I have been dying to read, for a long time, and this book being the first in the new Dragons of Eternity series, seemed like an ideal place to start.\n",

      "Tayla, twenty-five years ago had the misfortune of believing she had been kidnapped from her father’s gem shop, and sold to a dragon by Troll Slave-Traders, managing to use her then unknown skills to escape, she has been on the run ever since.\n",

      "Baine being the dragon Talya escaped from all those years ago, has been looking for her ever since. When he finally catches up with her, sparks fly, the fires of desire rage and the sheets on the bed literally go up in flames. But the story isn’t just about this dragon finding his mate, Tayla finds out that her capture wasn’t a simple kidnapping as she thought, and Baine realises that the woman he believes is his soul-mate, is not just going to lie down and accept her fate. Add into that her unknown skills have now become common knowledge and there are quite a few beings out to claim her as their own.\n",

      "There is quite a lot going on in this book, we get too meet a few characters that I hope will feature more in future books, and the author does a really good job of setting the scene and giving enough background for everything, without over doing it and detracting from Baine and Tayla’s reconnection. The story was unique and well-paced, the sexy-times plentiful and perfectly described. I liked Tayla’s ballsy attitude, and Baine’s somewhat clumsy attempts to woo her. This is definitely a start of a series that I will be eagerly looking for more of in the future.\n",

Unfortunately, the club didn’t make enough money and the debts were due soon. She was broke and unable to pay them at all. She knew that she would be in serious trouble when the collection day came.

And to tell you the truth, I skimmed through some of them but I think I didn’t miss anything important.\n",

When she runs into trouble, he's there to help... for a price... in the form of one year of her company. Their relationship grows and sexy times ensue. It's good that Ivan keeps his job separate and that he cares for Katy in a way that feels believable. I enjoyed this book :)\n",

I definitely craved more of a build up, and I felt like scenes were missing that would have contributed to that. The timeframe often skips ahead (from New Years Eve to Valentine’s Day to St. Patrick’s Day, etc.) and I was left wondering about their interactions in between. Since they’ve not met before the night of their one night stand, I needed more of them getting to know each other to become invested in the romance angle.\n",

      "I bought this sweet contemporary romance as a 99c Kindle special, thinking that this sounded like a nice change of pace from the \"he done her wrong and is now trying to win her back\" type of plots that Jennifer Peel tends to gravitate to. Kenadie (she of the \"sable-colored eyes\") is the owner of a successful personal relationship company (matchmaking, though she hates the word), but she's refused to date any man since she was abandoned at the altar seven years ago, after her fiancé made a cruel, dismissive statement. Still: seven. years. ago. And she won't give any man the time of day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enter Jason, the best friend of Kenadie's work partner Zander. Jason clearly wants to get to know Kenadie better, but because he's aware of her personal issues he plays the long game: becoming a client of their company, asking Kenadie to go out with him on a trial basis, inviting her to go on platonic-ish outings with him, dating the ladies she sets him up with ...\n",
      "\n",
      "This story dragged on and on, and Kenadie took forever to start to take off her armor, even in the slightest degree. It was highly frustrating and veered into boring territory for me; I had to start skimming to get through this book. I liked Jason, he's a nice guy, but I spent most of the book wanting to slap Kenadie upside the head. And I've never seen a heroine who's so blind to what's going on in her life, right in front of her face. Okay, she's purposely put blinders on, but I just couldn't buy into that degree of obliviousness, at all.\n",

      "Could not put it down! Another 2:00 am finish for me. The romantic dynamics reminded me a bit of Edenbrooke by Julianne Donaldson, except in a contemporary setting and with different conflicts. Fabulous chemistry and romantic tension complete with fun banter, friendship, and yearning for more. Highly recommend!!!\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Ow. This book is painfully one-note. A bad experience seven years ago has Kenadie so wound up she can't even look at guys, let alone date them. Which is odd seeing as she runs a matching/relationship service. I'm sorry, but seven years is just too long for this to be such a huge part of her life, particularly when her entire profession is built around relationships and compatibility. I found I couldn't take her seriously and each repetition of her stupid litany about pain made me like her less. Which is a shame because there's a lot there to like. I kept it up through a quarter of the book hoping for some hint of some other note besides \"poor me, I'm so scarred\" but no dice. I hate to miss getting to know Jason better. He seems like a nice guy. Sadly, I can't stand spending any more time in that pit of despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, Zander is a freaking jerk and I can't stand that nobody calls him out on his crappy behavior. Sorry, not loveable or goofy, just immature and stupid. Once I thought about screaming for Jason to save himself from the toxic duo I just couldn't go on.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This one is my favorite of Jennifer Peel's to date! Kenadie has been burned and burned good. After she was jilted at the alter, relationships have a bad taste to them and she wants nothing to do with them. Seven years later, she and her best friend, Zander, are working at a company she created to help others find their one true love. She's only ever had success stories. But something like that can't last, can it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Zander is the kind of best friend that ever girl needs and wants. He's a little inappropriate, but his heart is huge. He is great at building up self-esteem, listening, and distracting Kenadie from the depressing things in life. She can count on him for anything. They once tested things in high school to see how a relationship between them would go down, but it so wasn't happening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Life changes when Zander introduces Kenadie to Jason, his former college roommate. Jason is a knight in shining armor. He's recently single from a bad breakup as well, and I loved it when it was mentioned that he has the patience of Job because that's what I was thinking for most of the book. He's kind, chivalrous, handsome, and will do whatever it takes to give Kenadie space, while still trying to woo her. He's the perfect hero for this story!\n",
      "\n",
      "There were moments when I wanted to slap Kenadie. Really...7 years is a long time to be so bitter. It just goes to show how deeply she feels and how much she wants to protect herself from that heartache again. She is a little slow when it comes to hints and clues, but it's all worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved the journeys and progress that's made. Kenadie has a wonderful family and support and they're all so patient with her. Jason and Zander each have their own secrets and journeys to go through as well. There's nothing more satisfying than a story with a great plot, strong characters, and a romance that makes me swoon. This story has it all and more! Zander is the best friend that every girls wants and needs; Jason is patient and persistent; and Kenadie is stubborn and protective, but when you mix them together with a dating site, fireworks, surprises, and magic happen...and I loved every minute of it!\n",

      "This was an okay read. The story is interesting, bloody, gore-y, and sexy. But it’s also a bit much.\n",
      "Too much back and forth.\n",
      "In my opinion when you do a semi-triangle, and you make one person more likable than the other, but the heroine likes the less likable hero better it’s irritating. I know that some people may like the heroines favored hero better, but I just didn’t really. At first possibly, but then the other hero... fuckkkkkk. He’s everything. I think introducing him did a disservice to the first hero and heroine and the love they supposedly feel for each other.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Awakened by Sin is book 4 in the Crime Lord Series and it's Carmen's story. If your familiar with this series you know that Carmen is Layla's cousin and the wife of Vinny who was killed after trying to take Gavin's place in the underworld. I have to be honest I was annoyed before starting this book because I hate love triangles, I avoid them at all cost. I read for enjoyment and I feel in a love triangle you have a 50/50 chance of being disappointed if the person your rooting for isn't chosen. So like I said I was annoyed, add in there wasn't a romance to be found anywhere and a woman still mourning the death of her husband and I was like WTH? Mia was it to early for Carmen to get her story because I feel like I'm going to get cheated. What I failed to see in the beginning was that this was Carmen's story not Carmen and Marcus or Carmen and Angel. It was her finding herself and who she is without Vinny. Carmen is loyal, loving, passionate, wild, impulsive and a tad crazy. Your either going to love her or hate her, personally I loved her. Although she makes decisions that will make you want to shake her and you may not always agree with her choices, that's who she is. Now for Marcus and Angel. I didn't go into this on any team. I liked them both and wanted to know more about them. I definitely chose a team early on because I felt that man brought out the best in Carmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Awakened by Sin was just awesome. I couldn't put it down and was on the edge of my seat the whole time because of how unpredictable Carmen can be. I have to admit I have no idea where her story is going to go and knowing Carmen it's going to be a crazy ride. The story does end in a cliffhanger that I wanted to throw my Kindle against the wall. Please Mia don't make us wait to long.\n",

      "\n",

      "Rhiannon and Xavier have been best friends since they were 8 and 10, respectively. His mom works for her family, which means he’s considered “low class.” I actually liked the chapters when they’re kids. We get chapters of when Rhiannon is 8, 12, 14, then 17 ish before they’re separated. During these years, we see the connection they had, the genuine love and friendship they shared❤️, even the abuse they endured because of her father🥺. I wasn’t too concerned about how fast these chapters moved (I wouldn’t have minded details though).\n",

At this point, I was enjoying myself, hoping we got information about why he’s been gone for ten years and what he’s been doing, why he treated her like ish when they kissed. And, in Rhi’s defense, she’s always had affection for Xavier. Sure. He’s been keeping tabs on her for years, but he needed to act quicker. But she’s angry at him for never keeping in touch. But I expected more.\n",

Nahhh… demand answers girl 👏🏻🙈. Plus, the scenes kept changing, chapters ending quickly, then suddenly we’re somewhere else. The whiplash was real here 😐.\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciated his dirty mouth though 🥵🔥. When he ties her up in the kitchen and asks her what do you do in a kitchen (she says cook) and he clarifies that you eat… well, he sure does 😅💦. They finally have smexxx at about 65%. It was 🔥🥵. But also cold since he basically tells her to get dressed after.\n",

      "And it continuous this way. Short chapters with not too many details. Which means that there were plot holes I wish were filled in. And the climax scene happens, I didn’t see it coming. I felt betrayed. And even when everything is kind of explained to her, it didn’t account for a lot of things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Listen. I can suspend belief while I’m reading books, but not to the extent that I’m wondering how we went from A to B 🤔or the lack of explanations given to allow things to make sense. Even when she asks Xavier for explanations, he doesn’t always provide them. I didn’t like that.\n",

The characters - including Jasper the dog - were engaging and fun, the setting was interesting (though I'd have liked more Scots flavor).

I admit the “will they/won’t they” scenario got slightly irritating at times, but as I’m a sucker for happy endings and for descriptions of the Scottish settings, I’ll forgive the author. A pleasant read overall.\n",

      "There are people who don't read Indigenous literature or find it difficult to find books by Native authors. I wanted to make more of a conscious effort to pick up books that give voice to these communities, especially after my favorite books of the past two years were by Native authors (There There by Tommy Orange and You Don't Have to Say You Love Me by Sherman Alexie, which I read before allegations against him).\n",

      "There are 27 essays in this collection by a variety of authors, who I believe are mostly part of Indigenous communities in the U.S. and Canada. The whole point, as described in the introduction, is to play with shape and form in new ways that may draw from traditions such as basket weaving, etc. As such, there are several fragmented essays, somer literary criticism, memoir, elements of poetry, historical events, etymology and discussion of language, etc. Basically, there is A LOT in this relatively short book.\n",

I really appreciated the way the book was set up; the editors split the essays into sections based on the way the authors approached them, structurally. It sounds sort of stuffy, but it was the opposite. Reading each essay felt revelatory, like I was being invited to not only really sit with the topic, but with the vessel (as Washuta and Warburton discuss in the introduction), with the particular way the authors chose to weave their words. Highly recommend, I will be sitting with this for a long time.\n",

      "While the story was definitely hot, I found my disbelief tested through out. I am not a fan of sexual blackmail nor of men or woman who imply the use of a safe word is wrong. And that is what the hero does. Here is a young lady who is not only sexually inexperienced but also has a condition requiring her to be in therapy and he disregards all that because he wants her. They haven't seen each other in 10 years but she's suppose to jump right into a sexual relationship with him and like it. I did like that our heroine wasn't a malleable lump and recognizes what he's doing. She turns the tables on him and that saved the book for me. She not only pushes her own boundaries but makes him push beyond his own. I admit a small part of me didn't like her thoughts in the end because she still feels that if she doesn't still do what he says, then it's all over. I wish that would have been addressed.\n",

      "The reviews I read about this book are a little misleading. They focus on the improbability of the arrangement and ignore the fact that although the heroine is painfully shy she is completely in control at all times. I will agree that the arrangement is a little creepy but the arrangement is an illusion. It is a mask both the characters hide behind. The heroine is at no point in the story a victim and she agrees to the arrangement not because of financial need or desperation but because of a fierce attraction that she has never been able to admit. And our hero, at a complete loss in trying to figure out how to break through her shyness to see if she is attracted to him, decides on a pretty desperate course of action. This was a very satisfying brief read. I would have liked to see the relationship between the characters continue to develop beyond the arrangement but I enjoyed the book and would recommend it.\n",

      "Ehhh... more like 2.5 stars. The writing was bad - journalistic at times, downright cringe-worthy at others (something about a father's voice \"so husky it could haul a sled\" eeuuurrrgggh). The tone was reverential, upbeat and hopeful in the face of discussions of mass extinctions and the price the planet will pay for our time on earth. And some of the details were just... made up. Like she read human features in the faces of sheep that had human cells in their organs. I would bet a lot of money Ackerman couldn't pick these supposedly human-looking specimens out of a lineup because spoiler alert they look like completely normal sheep (which I discovered through the magic of the internet). Ackerman uses offensive terms like \"cr*ppled\" and \"g*psy\" because it's fucking 1985 apparently. She also speaks of autism as a \"disease\" and then makes sweeping generalizations about human behavior without so much as a nod to neurodivergence. If \"we\" are all as \"connected\" as she insists, maybe she could do a quick google search to reveal how antiquated and harmful her terminology often is?\n",

      "Narrated by Barbara Caruso who also narrated Sue Hubbell's books Broadsides from the Other Orders: A Book of Bugs & Waiting for Aphrodite: Journeys into the Time Before Bones. This book is very much in the same vein, often almost poetic yet filled with facts & interesting tidbits.\n",

      "I really liked how she frames our current age in the eyes of a researcher from the future studying what is left behind after a geologic age or two. What fossils will we leave? What strange chemicals & materials will be found in layers of rock? It's a good perspective to take since ours is typically so short.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she points out, a long time to us is an eye blink in geologic time or even that of many types of plants & animals. Trilobytes died out a quarter of a billion years ago & yet thrived for as long. By comparison, human-like beings have only been around for a quarter of a million years with modern, sentient humans for roughly a fifth of that time. The Industrial Age is only a couple of centuries old & it's during this time when we have changed the planet as much as the other great in the 4.5 billion years of Earth's history.\n",
      "\n",
      "She's of the opinion that technology got us into this mess & it should be used to get us out of it, although she doesn't state it as directly as Asimov did. She gives a lot of great examples of new or maturing technologies that are minimizing out impact on the environment. Some were new to me, especially some in exotic locales, but few were explored in any depth which was a problem at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "She didn't do very well at robotics & AI, but did a great job with genes, epigenetics, & our microbiome. All of which combined to ask some great questions about how we define humanity, self awareness, & intelligence. I think Harrari does a better job in , but she asks the questions in a warmer way than he did with his algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her travels gave her a great overview of the world which helped the wandering style of the book. She covers a lot of range, but is definitely but is definitely best when sticking to softer subjects. There were some great insights & even funny moments. I forget the context & the exact wording, but she said something about which about had me rolling. I never thought of Cole Porter in that way & tend to hear Joan Jett doing or see anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She gets too humanistic at times. One quote was something about 'rabies knows anger & rage better than we know it ourselves'. Attributing volition or knowledge to diseases is ridiculous. It really undermined an otherwise great presentation on just how much bacteria can steer our thinking. She used example, even extending it beyond the rat-cat cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has a tendency to use numbers to make a point without putting them in perspective & even suggests incorrect correlations such as when she compares solar energy station outputs with that of others. Storing energy in sufficient quantity is still very difficult & inefficient, so comparing it directly to stable power sources doesn't work without a lot of qualifications. She provides none. She ignores the danger of promoting industrialization & subsequent colonization in marginal areas like the Nevada desert, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her description of had me thinking it was far better than a little research showed it is. It makes me wonder just what the ROI is on any of the schemes she promotes such as gathering the heat of commuters from subway stations.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROI is ALWAYS a consideration. I've looked into alternative energy sources for my own farm & wouldn't mind paying a little extra to help the environment, but the last time I looked at wind turbines, it would have been a ridiculous investment of time & money. I can't afford to lay out $10,000 & only see a $2500 return in 5 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her views on living with wildlife are idyllic at best. In dealing with pests & invasive species, she's unbelievably naive. She mentions collecting 1,000 pythons out of the Everglades in a decade, says there are an estimated 30,000, tells of one with 86 eggs, & yet makes it sound as if eradicating them is a possibility. Seriously? She didn't mention New Zealand's issues with rats, Australia's with rabbits, or ours with Gypsy moths. Hasn't she read ? While we've gotten a little better, government attempts to eradicate pests are often far worse than the pests themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heck, our government is the reason we have a lot of the pests in the first place. Multifloral rose was actively planted by Federal mandate to halt erosion after their half-assed assessment assured them it wouldn't spread by seed. They only tested with 3 species of birds, all of which had gravels, though. Song birds don't, weren't tested & wound up being perfect Johnny Roseseeds. Not only do they prep the seed by dissolving the protective skin, but deposit it with fertilizer & moisture when they poop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her idea that large crop farming is hampered by crops which can't reproduce 'naturally' or patented seeds is ridiculous. There's very little natural about how wheat has stayed ahead of wheat rust nor should there be & seeds have been patented for over a century. Her use of the 'organic' label as something good is silly. Bt is used on organic corn, just not engineered in. Some of the 'natural' chemicals allowed are far worse than their manufactured counterparts & lack the quality controls. While she has a lot of company in her belief, I expected better from her. She needs to spend less time traveling to exotic locales & spend a little more time at home with local farmers & research what the 'organic' label really means.\n",
      "\n",
      "it was an enjoyable look at the Anthropocene epoch, if one that lacked some critical details & played a bit loose with facts. Considering the territory she covered, that was inevitable. She asked some good questions & showed a pretty balanced view overall. I'll give it 3.5 stars & round up to 4, but with a warning not to take everything she says at face value.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Five stars because it deserves 4.5... and everyone should read it, and almost everyone will enjoy and/or learn something from it. For those people who are still heedless of their impact on Mother Nature, some of the interlinked essays will, I hope, serve as prod. For those people who despair, many of the essays give hope that our inventiveness will enable us to live better within our biosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, as others have mentioned, Ackerman covers a lot of ground. It's a survey - there's a list of books \"For Further Reading.\" Here we get anecdotes, outlines, ideas. And, yes, her prose is almost purple. Whether or not that's a good thing depends on the reader; I definitely prefer it to the dry academic tone of some serious science books, or the forced wit of some pop science books.\n",

      "Bladeless wind turbines, 3D printing of organs, vertical gardens on skyscrapers, more of our body is microbes than human, sustainable mariculture, epigenetics, not just a disconnect from real life but also more myopia from our immersion in our devices, invasive species, Apps for Apes, palm oil in our products kills orangutans, mind-controlled prosthetics, bringing extinct species back to life, bringing AL to AI, treated wastewater getting further filtered through places like the Wakodahatchee Wetlands, etc. So much to learn about!

      "The book is a series of stories each in a separate chapter ranging from nature to technology to the human body. I found each chapter well written, almost poetic. Whether you agree with her position that the way man has used and abused the environment is remediable not necessarily by using more technology but by modifying our behavior, including industrial and social behavior, she makes interesting points.\n",

      "The ending chapters on the human body, particularly the factors we are beginning to understand in how our DNA influences what we become and the role played by the environment, were my favorite chapters, but there are other excellent sections ranging from the sea to outer space.\n",

There were still a lot of errors at this stage -- a bit where some words were struck out, problems with punctuation, etc. I think the purple prose will be there to stay, though; the writing isn't terrible, but it's rather overloaded, and I'm not keen on Ackerman's flights of imagination. It's one thing to imagine the trace we're leaving on the earth for future archaeologists, it's another to imagine those future archaeologists. That's science fiction, which I don't have any argument with, but I don't tend to like it when that crosses over into my supposed non-fiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ackerman picked an interesting topic, though, and aside from the blizzard of adjectives, this book is an easy read. It's not a pessimistic humans-are-destroying-the-world sort of book; at one point she mentions the idea of (some) industrial landscapes being beautiful, which is apparently a growing tourist thing in some parts of the world.\n",

      "I remember when I got my first Vans shoes. I think I slept with them on my bed refusing to remove them after days of begging my mom to get them for me. Getting my Vans meant I was a cool kid! LOL! Nah, who am I kidding I am still a book nerd. Well thank goodness Vans is making me cool again because I am the book nerd reading this fun memoir, and now my kids are wearing Vans! ⁣⁣\n",
      "⁣⁣\n",
      "This memoir is both an entertaining and engrossing read. Fresh and candid, I am so glad to have learned more about Paul Van Doren whose charismatic leadership of Vans, turned this company into a beloved brand with fans all over the world. Vans has been synonymous to the laid-back vibe of SoCal, and became well known for its people-oriented company culture. ⁣⁣\n",
      "⁣⁣\n",
      "In 𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐜, Van Doren shares his amazing journey from a high-school dropout to a sneaker-industry leader. As an entrepreneur and an innovator, when the first House of Vans store opened in 1966 as a stand alone just selling shoes was unheard of, Van Doren has a story we can all learn from.⁣\n",

      "Also, who will ever forget Sean Penn wearing Vans’ famous checkerboard slip-on shoe in the film Fast Times at Ridgemont High? That was awesome! ⁣\n",

      "The story of Vans is fascinating. Paul Van Doren grew up in a working class family on the east coast. He worked for Randy's for many years, a company that made shoes with vulcanized rubber soles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason Vans happened, really, is because Van Doren was let go from the job he'd had at Randy's for so long.\n",
      "\n",
      "The common threads through Van Doren's story: He was a super hard worker, relied on insights from customers and boots on the ground intel (rather than guessing), and had a little bit of luck.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoyed all the stories and anecdotes, especially how Van Doren solved shipping and inventory problems... how he was willing to pull all-nighters to get work done... and how he amplified his luck when luck happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you liked Shoe Dog by Phil Knight, then you'll probably also enjoy this memoir. It's got a similar rags-to-riches vibe.\n",

      "I always wanted to be a little skater kid.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my freshman year of high school I finally bought my first pair of Vans. Some real cute purple and grey Authentic Era Vans, then set off to find my first skateboard. I ended up with a Sector9 long board and my obsession grew from there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally, when I was that the Founder of Vans, Paul Van Doren, was writing a book, I knew I wanted to hear his story. Did I really care about shoe production? Not really. But I was intrigued by the history of how and why Vans was created. Skaters embraced the Vans brand and Vans was willing to listen to what they wanted. Tony Alva, one of the original Z-Boys came into a Vans storefront and begged to just buy one shoe. Other skaters came in asking for better ankle protection, thus the SK8-Hi and jazz stripe was born. Vans realized they were really the only shoe company tackling the needs of extreme sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "But more than that, Vans was the biggest family company around. Paul Van Doren rounded up all his kids and siblings and in-laws and created a company that would not exist without the help of the entire family. Which is why Vans relies on families. They rely on their workers, the whole team has always felt like a family.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm honestly obsessed with this book.\n",
      "I loved reading about the skater kids coming in.\n",
      "I loved reading about Vans Warped Tour.\n",

My daughter calls my brother her vans dealer. We’ve rushed to the vans store to all buy the shark week vans. I loved reading about the come up of my favorite shoes.\n",

      "Review 1\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Flannery O'Connor is a diminutive, sprite-like woman who writes some of the most powerful fiction (of its type) that I have ever read.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you like Faulkner, you will most likely enjoy O'Connor's work as well. It is a kind of theater of the macabre, southern, holy, and surreal all at once. The characters arrive in the story as if in a fever dream, emerging from some faint mist that she has shrouded them in so that they may pop out at just the right moment; they take on their lives fully-formed, portraying real people with extraordinary personal problems embedded deep in their psyche. O'Connor's action takes place deep in the minds and beliefs of her characters, with their thoughts boiling out into the area around them to wreck havoc. I have seen stills from a movie created about Wise Blood; the characters look like they fell out of a Magritte painting, which I think is an apt tone to give to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "There isn't much action in the two main novels in this collection (at least not in the traditional sense of action), but the work still draws you in nonetheless. With that in mind, I believe that O'Connor should be read for one of two reasons (though you can get a casual reading pleasure from them both as well):\n",
      "\n",
      "1) To study, digest, and think about. Her work is incredibly complicated, with symbolic set pieces strewn throughout. Quite frankly, when I finished a recent reread of Wise Blood, I felt like I needed to sit and talk about it for an hour with other readers just to scratch the surface of the meaning. The same could be said of The Violent Bear it Away--each of these two novels captures your (can I call it this?) critical-thinking attention and will not let it go.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) As a writer. Just as Faulkner, Joyce, and Woolf should be read by serious writers in order to explore both their style and the ways in which they bend and break the rules of language, so too should O'Connor be studied for the ways in which she extrapolates character in the simplest of beliefs. O'Connor has a way of stretching these beliefs into monstrous proportions, pulling them like taffy to find all the little nuances that lie within. As a writer, I found it fascinating that she could pull and pull on a character like that, finding new truths hiding deep within that she would then share with the reader. Though in The Violent Bear it Away it gets a bit tiresome at in the first 30 pages, the rest of the two main novels in this collection are to be studied and admired for their scope.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Signet edition of O'Connor's work is a steal. For less than ten dollars (when I bought it) you can get two of her novels, plus a collection of short stories.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "2/5 Stars\n",
      "\n",
      "This is going to be an extremely short \"review,\" only because this was read in class, and I didn't enjoy it. What I did, however, appreciate was O'Connor's descriptive writing and well-rounded story-lines. But nothing else was phenomenal, and frankly, it was quite boring to read through.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not my type of literature.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Flannery O’Connor’s writing feels like it was originally written in Russian but translated into English by Constance Garnett.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick-notes:\n",
      "\n",
      "Wiseblood: A comic novel that is simultaneously surreal and terrifying. There are scenes and images in here that will never leave me. You have to keep telling yourself this is a parody of a certain type of blind religious conviction. At least I think it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Violent Bear it Away: My favorite piece out of the three. Again, disturbing religious extremism. What if you were kidnapped, raised by your great uncle in the boonies and fed nothing but fat-back and bible verses?\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything That Rises Must Converge: Southern sketches, mostly deformed, incapable intellectual men living with their mothers while fighting with a variety of ghosts (not really ghosts, but religious obsession, racism, etc.) and losing grotesquely.\n",
      "\n",
      "General: Interesting that O’Connor writes so many pathetic male protagonists. But it’s not just them, everyone is deformed by their obsessions. It’s hard to take all the off-hand use of the N-word, but at least part of her point (at least in Everything Rises) is to paint white people as demented by their prejudices, so there’s that? A hard reminder of how deep savage and primitive racism runs when it’s source of renewal is insecurity and fear.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I really enjoyed these short stories by O'Connor. She really knew how to tell a story, to develop character, and to prove a point in a short amount of time. Her writing draws me in and is oddly suspenseful. I loved reading this part of the book. The novels are good, but I gave the book 4 stars for the third part of the collection. As much as I love O'Connor, reading her in short story form is all I can handle. Her novels are so intense and heady in a way that the stories avoid being since they're quickly resolved (if you can call anything in an O'Connor story \"resolved\").\n",
      "I recommend this book if you can handle religious debates, matricide, heart attacks, strokes, insanity, and so much more. It's worth it for the pure pleasure of reading O'Connor's prose.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Seriously -- wow! O'Connor is fabulous. I've read her short stories before, you know since high school and through college and all of that, and they were good then, too. This time, though, reading for pleasure for the third or fourth time, I was amazed. Such well-written stories and short novels, beautiful, funny, sinister, always with some surprising twist. Even when I know what'll happen it's surprising. An author I love more and will have to return to again and again.\n",

      "A very good book. I actually bought this book, as it appeared on my recommendations list, the title instantly caught my attention. Then on closer inspection I realized the author was the wife on one of my favorite wrestlers CM Punk, even though I stopped watching wrestling a few years ago, and have never seen one of Aj's matches, (I will remedy that with youtube), why not give it a go. I am really surprised how much I actually did like the book, and I think definitely has important messages about mental illness. I especially like the way AJ personalizes the illness calling it the darkness and the villain of the story to be defeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I am not main target audience, but I proved my geekhood by recognizing every comic book storyline and character mentioned in the book. On this notes AJ's geeky jokes are great. AJ talks very passionately about mental illness, the way outcasts like freaks and geek are perceived. Though she does all of this from the female point of view. Apart from some message/warnings to depraved men, she does not talk about the same for the males. I understand this as she writes about what she knows. The other thing is she asks a question is you are not a wrestling fan why did you buy this book? There is not all that much about wrestling itself in the book. For people like me who are CM Punk fans they is also not much of him in the book he does get half a chapter devoted to their relationship but not a huge amount. However this is HER story and not his. This is a good book about achieving your dreams, being fine within your own skin and changing perceptions along the way.\n",

      "I love reading autobiographies of famous people that I have never heard of, especially females. This book was one of those situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "A.J. is a Three-time WWE Diva's Champion. This book describes her nontraditional life and mental health issues that she went through to get there. She grew up in extreme poverty with parents that moved constantly. When she became famous she fought against stereotypes. Making others realize that women have a purpose in wrestling besides their looks.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book was very funny, entertaining and I learned a lot!\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Truthfully speaking, I'm very picky when it comes to nonfiction novels particularly memoirs. It's either they're engrossing or excruciatingly boring. Crazy Is My Superpower was on my radar since it's published and it's written by former WWE superstar AJ Lee. I'm a huge fan of WWE since I was seven or eight years old and still watching it up to this day. However, I lost my interest during the Divas Era because some female wrestlers aren't as great as Lita, Trish Stratus, Chyna etc. It was an era where people paid less attention to the female roster and an excuse for them to go to the bathroom during their matches.\n",
      "\n",
      "AJ Lee was a great in-ring performer and was one of my favorites in the Divas era along with Beth Phoenix, Natalya and Paige. I watched matches if one these women are in it. AJ Lee was the reason there was a revolution in her era resulting the rebirth of women's wrestling. Yes, she did that. I respect her for being passionate about the wrestling business and outspoken that female wrestlers deserved equality in terms of payment. If men can do main events, so as women if WWE give them better bookings.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this book, she talks about her life inside and outside the ring. The harsh reality living with financial struggles, having a dysfunctional family, and coping with mental illness. She has a bipolar disorder just like her mom and she talks about the importance of mental health awareness. It written straightforwardly with a touch humor, sarcasm and quirkiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love AJ's personality. She's such a cool nerd. I love her video games, anime, comics, TV show and movie reference and we shared similar tastes in video games and anime. I'm feeling nostalgic on the video games. I miss my PlayStation. Overall, this is great read despite of my slow reading pace. I'm hoping she'll write another book.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Aj Lee's story is to me empowering. There was no \"I had a shitty life feel sorry for me\" in this book. No. It was more I want this so I'm going to bust my ass to get this. Sure she got knocked down a few times but she got back up and did what she had to, to reach her goals. This women has a ton of strength and I admire her even more now. This is not all about her days in the wwe. It's about her family, growing up poor, her own fight with mental illness. I loved her in the wwe. I respect the hell out of her even more now after reading this.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "AJ Mendez is a singular woman who is proof that no matter how high the odds are stacked against you, if you cultivate imagination, find inner strength, and don't let anyone define who you are or who you want to become, you can succeed. In this deeply personal, poignant, and, at times, humorous account of her life, she writes about growing up desperately poor with parents who were equal parts loving and brutal. She writes about fighting the established norms of the WWE, opens up about battling her demons, and provides a raw, honest look at what it feels like to live with bipolar disorder. In CRAZY IS MY SUPERPOWER she offers an original, compelling and ultimately uplifting story about finding her way despite the many obstacles she had to overcome.\n",

      "I had bought this book to relive those moments I had spent glued to Doordarshan and watching Rajit Kapoor enacting the role of Byomkesh Bakshi.There are very few English translation of Byomkesh bakshi stories available. I had already read Sreejata Guha “Picture Imperfect & other Byomkesh Bakshi stories” and wanted to catch a few more stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt slightly disappointed with this translation. The writing is oversimplified, to an extent that it fails to capture the tempo & suspense of the original TV serial. I also believe that stories were quite condensed and didn’t capture the details.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you haven’t read any of Byomkesh Bakhsi stories in English, then my suggestion will be to read “Picture Imperfect and other Byomkesh Bakshi stories” first and then if you want more then you can come back to this book. For records both these books have a different set of stories.\n",

      "THIS IS NOT THE BOOK I READ BUT GOODREADS DOESN'T HAVE THE ONE I READ ON IT FOR NOW AND SO I SHALL REPLACE ONE SET OF BYOMKESH BAKSHI STORIES WITH ANOTHER BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE MY 2012 BOOK READING CHALLENGE DAMNIT!!!!!\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I had a face to Byomkesh Bakshi thank to this very vague mental image of the serial on DD once upon a time. I don't think it was a good thing really given how wannabe the book sounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Indian mold of Sherlock Holmes and Watson was a bit underwhelming to me. I especially found it irritating that the detective called himself the the \"Truth seeker\". But not all is lost since the book had a mix of stories that were puzzling and some of the mysteries appetizing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The English translation seems a bit too simple and the different styles of narration are a bit jarring. Many of the stories you were able guess before the detective and that takes away a bit of fun. The quicksand story was truly puzzling but then convoluted.\n",

      "I did not see that coming!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I thought this was going to be a regular magical mystery, but it turned into a full-blow Studio Ghibli movie in book form and I loved every moment of it. I hope to be reading the sequels in the future because this was such a delightful, dark, and magical read.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is a middle-grade book, so personally I found it a little tame but as I'm clearly not the target audience I'll be reviewing it with that in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a delightful little story: Stella lives at the Hotel Majestic with her three tyrannical aunts and dreams of the far-off places she learns about in her Atlas. Then one night she witnesses something she shouldn't and it puts her in the path of danger, running from an insidious enemy known as The Professor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The setting is really beautifully detailed, and you feel instant sympathy for Stella who is treated pretty terribly. At the same time, there's not a huge emphasis on the bullying - her aunts aren't blatantly cruel, they're just cold and believe in being 'proper'. So while we don't particularly like them, they're not a ridiculous stereotype. At the same time, we can understand perfectly well why Stella wants to escape them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Stella unwraps the package, magic begins to leak into the story, and suddenly there's more to this story than meets the eye. Suddenly impossible things become possible, and Stella's adventure leads her in a more mystical direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved the characters she met along the way, and wished they'd come into the story earlier. I loved the friends she made and I think her friendships are a really important element to enjoying this story. There's also no grand gestures to cement things, which I thought was really good. There's no she makes friends, other than that's what happens with people of a like mind. It felt very genuine and warm.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also some important moral lessons about helping, and pity, and understanding. For a children's novel, the characters are fairly grey and I think that's what will make this book stand out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The illustrations are fantastic, too. They really spur the imagination and add an extra element of enjoyment to the story. My favourite was the illustration on page 143 of Stella, Mr Capelli, and all those cats.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's such a warmth to the story, and kids will be entertained by the situations Stella finds herself in. It's magical but also easy to follow, and The Professor presents an intelligent, malicious sort of figure to be properly terrified of.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a great story with fantastic illustrations, so I can see this being a bit hit, particularly with spirited young girls. Highly recommend for younger ones.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is an enormously entertaining Victorian mystery-thriller for upper primary aged readers. Girls may like it more, simply due to the heroine being a girl, and one of the supporting characters Gert (whom I LOVED) also being a girl. But there's lots to enjoy for boys as well – monsters, magic, trickery, acrobatics, and action! And the other main supporting character is a boy, whom I look forward to seeing again in the second book, in his new life. Like most 'first in a series' books, there's a bit of work that necessarily goes into setting up the characters and their environment. By the time the second book comes along, we will be raring to go, already knowing Stella who is deftly resourceful and quietly brave, Gert who is a powerhouse of female humour and strength, and Ben with his mysterious past and exciting future. Mr Capelli and his fantastic team of cats are a delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The period details are engaging, never more so than when Jude Rossell settles down to really describe a scene in depth, such as the embroidery/sewing scene, which put me in mind of one of my favourite books, Elizabeth Goudge's The Little White Horse. It's in these moments that we really get to feel part of the story, and feel as though we are in the heroine's skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there's a further pull with this delightful book, and the reason I took several days to read it, instead of one or two nights: the design and illustration of the book, which caused me to stop and linger for many minutes at every full page illustration. Jude Rossell has really hit her stride with this project, which melds her natural ability to render careful detail, with an Ardizzone-like use of light and shadow. There's nothing I love more than an illustrated scene in a children's book where not all is immediately apparent… we have the pleasure of delving into the page and using both our eyes and our imagination to make out what is happening in the shadows, while the atmosphere of light and shade affects us as viewers more than any other illustrative tool. It's almost as evocative as an aroma.\n",
      "\n",
      "Counterbalancing these moody full page illustrations are many small illustrations in the margins, and these are light and clear, depicting the paraphernalia of the Victorian era. The whole book is printed in dark blue ink on quality cream paper stock. Hardback, with a sumptuous cover and blue satin ribbon for marking your page. It's a book I enjoyed holding as an adult but would have been in raptures over as a child.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is seriously the best book I have EVER read! It starts off while Stella is reading her treasured atlas she found in a conservatory in hotel majestic. While she is reading, she hears someone come in, saying something she shouldn't of heard. Will they catch her?\n",
      "\n",
      "Join Stella on a adventure of a lifetime that anyone 10-12+ will love. I really really really really REALLY loved it. I even emailed the author, Judith Rossel, and she replied! I hope everyone loves this book as much as I did, so please keep me updated on how you are enjoying it!\n",

      "‘Stella Montgomery lay hidden behind the ferns in the conservatory of the Hotel Majestic, flat on the mossy tiles, tracing a path through the Amazon jungle in a small, damp atlas.'\n",
      "\n",
      "In the town of Withering-by-Sea, in the Hotel Majestic, Stella Montgomery lives with her aunts: Condolence, Temperance and Deliverance. Poor Stella! She is often in trouble with her aunts as she would much rather go exploring than learn how to play the pianoforte. She’d rather read her atlas than learn French Conversation for Young Ladies.\n",
      "\n",
      "But one day, while Stella is reading her atlas in the hotel conservatory, she sees Mr Filbert (another resident of the Hotel Majestic) hiding a package in an urn. Stella’s curiosity knows few boundaries, and that night she sneaks out of her room to investigate. But Stella’s troubles are about to begin: thieves have broken into the Hotel Majestic and are demanding that Mr Filbert tell them where the package is. Mr Filbert sees Stella and asks her to protect the package. This puts Stella in danger … can she outwit the thieves?\n",
      "\n",
      "To write more about this delightful novel with its adventure and magic, and messages of friendship could remove the sheer joy of turning each page to find out what happens next. Yes, this is a novel for children aged 9 and older, but this senior adult really enjoyed it as well. It’s beautifully illustrated, and now I need to read ‘Wormwood Mire’ which is the second book in this series.\n",

      "Dori Grant, seventeen and unmarried, has a six month-old son. Waiting tables and washing dishes at the local diner, she's determined to make a good life for her son. Johnny Pine at twenty is the guardian of his young brothers. Driving a dozer for a construction company for a living and making ends meet is hard, but he's going to be both mother and father to his brothers.\n",

      "\n",
      "There’s something so gorgeous about this young couple. Both have been through such hardships, are to be parents, and yet take on the responsibilities with maturity, making incredible sacrifices for the children in their care. The way Johnny Pine stands up for and protects his younger brothers is all kinds of wonderful.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is as much about the town and its residents as it is about Johnny and Dori. Set in Blessings, Georgia this is filled with a cast of Southern smalltown characters. Though Johnny and Dori are very young, I wouldn't classify this as either young-adult or new-adult.\n",
      "\n",
      "The actual romance takes place in about a week. The come too quickly and the ending was a little excessive, but I don't care. I don't think everyone will love this as much as I did, but I thoroughly enjoyed this story, and look forward to the next in the series. And I'll be checking out the two previous titles set in Blessings - the prequel novella and the first novel .\n",

      "‘I’ll Stand by You’ is a contemporary romance at its best. It was such a good read, full of emotional, uplifting, and heartbreaking moments that got me a little teary-eyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aspect of romance in this one was thoroughly beautiful. I loved how Johnny and Dori’s love gradually blossomed. And it was impossible not to feel entirely moved by the way they felt for each other and how they still had so much love to give despite what they both had been through.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really loved the hero, Johnny. He was such a good man and he loved his two little brothers fiercely. There was no question of his protectiveness toward them. He was caring, thoughtful, understanding, kind, and protective. Totally my kind of hero!\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved the heroine, Dori, as well. Given that she became a mother of a boy at only the age of seventeen, how she could manage her upside down life and be strong for her baby and granddaddy was definitely beyond my imagination. Just when I thought nothing worse could happen to this sweet girl and her little baby, but then one night, her world was completely upended once again. Thankfully, she didn’t have to experience the greatest loss alone. Johnny and his brothers came to her rescue. He was her true hero.\n",

      "I love reading the books that inspire and give a good meaning of unconditional love. And this one definitely fell into that category. It had almost everything I could want in my read. However, I wouldn’t be honest if I told you that this book was flawless, but since it really made me feel good inside, I couldn’t help but give it 5 stars instead of 4.\n",

Normally those things would bring my rating down, but the characters and world building in this story are excellent. I loved Johnny, Dori, the kids and all of the townspeople. The love story is amazingly sweet and I truly didn't want the story to end! This is a series so I might go ahead and read the next one hoping for Johnny and Dori sightings😉\n",

      "Sharon Sala I have a bone to pick with you! I have not slept in 2 days because I'll Stand by You just would not allow it! How could I possibly turn off my kindle and not know what Johnny Pine and Dori were doing? The other bone that needs picking is this: I have been married 15 years and you straight up wrote a character that I fell in love with. Luckily my husband has the sweet, kind, hardworking and loyal soul of our Johnny Pine or he would have had some work to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "All kidding aside- I'll stand by You is a fantastic book. A book to be gobbled and absorbed until you reluctantly come to the end. I adore Dori and Johnny. Both grew up fast because life demanded it from them. There are lessons to be had in this book. Most of all- Do not judge each other. Classism is a real issue and it is unfortunate.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are taking the time to read this review I beg of you to give this book a shot. Go on over to the library, to Amazon, your local store or wherever it is you obtain your books and make sure you get a copy of I’ll Stand by You by Sharon Sala. It's one of those books that get you over the slump of having read a bunch of heavy books and just want that happily ever after. Yes, there is a tad bit of 'Insta-love\" but it is not corny or eye rolling inducing. I promise. It’s one of those books where you feel like you may know these people or even better, you may relate to the issues in your own life.\n",

      "This Brazen novel is predictably wonderful, it has chemistry by the pageful and there's more romance inside than a New York Tiffany's store before valentines day. Nicolette day has provided a full on dreamy, steamy, heart pounding story and you all know I can't resist an enemies to 'I'll-take-you-anywhere-anyhow-as-long-as-I-can-get-a-taste' story. This author has grabbed my heart and given it a good old fashioned squeeze. There wasn't even a teeny tiny bit of doubt that I didn't adore this story, everything about it screamed 'perfect-for-Lisa' and I was already having that five star love feeling by page two. If I was loved up by book one in this series, then this book 'put a ring on it'. I can't wait to read more from this delightful author. Nicolette Day you're a Brazen-book-writing-beauty and I don't ever want your writing to end. Still need convincing? Here's the rest of my book thoughts ...\n",

Lilly decides to ignore the raging temptation of this Six foot marine as thoughts of their last 'encounter' is still fresh in her mind. But anger over their last connection soon gives way to lust as they battle it out to arrive in one piece to the wedding. But when feelings that have no place start to form, this duo have face the decision to fight for what they have or allow demons from Nate's past and the reality that this marine doesn't plan to stay get in the way of a future together.\n",

      "From beginning to end I was out and out addicted by this story line. Predictable? Well used plot? Yes to both, but luckily for me this storyline works every time and I don't really mind that it was predicable, not in the least because it made my heart race, my toes curl and I admit I even had a tear or two. You want seduction, charm and sexual frustration? This book was bursting at the seams with it all and more. It most definitely has the 'I-don't-want-to-put-this-book-down-until-I've-finished' quality attached to it. The couple of this story were wonderfully in the spot light and although we get to see the characters from book one, the book from start to finish keeps the focus on Lilly and Nate. Undeniably this couple were setting off fireworks between them with their desire right from chapter one there is no denying that this author has a wicked talent of writing intimately, filthy scenes. This book should come with the warning 'don't enter unless you are happy to be thoroughly pleasured' attached to it. All in all I was armoured with everything contained in the 206 pages of novel and I'm sure it's a book I'll be tempted to pick up and read again.\n",

'Tempted by the soldier' is like my reading equivalent of a cadbury's dairy milk chocolate bar to a raving chocoholic. I'm sure I'll always be tempted by this authors novels and I'm excited to read more. If like me you are brazen book proud, add this to your 'to be read' you won't be disappointed. Enjoy, kisses.\n",

      "I first became acquainted with this author when I read and absolutely loved the first book in this series, which was a novella, No Strings Attached. As much as I loved the deliciously tatted Jace, I also remember hoping to get a book for his sexy Marine brother, Nate. Well obviously the book gods have smiled on me, because not only did I get it, but it even managed to blow the first book out of the water. I LOVED this book. I'm talking couldn't-put-it-down love. Read-it-in-one-sitting love. I-can't-flippin-wait-for-more-in-this-series-love. And last but certainly not least, multiple-panty-changes-LOVED.\n",

      "One year ago, Lilly gave in to the burning attraction between her and Nate, only to be left a wad of cash for a cab the next morning and a lecture on how a girl like her should have known better than to think this was something more than one night. So suffice it to say, she harbors just a tiny bit resentment towards the sexy Marine. It certainly doesn't help that she's forced to see him on a regular basis after since he's the brother of her best friend's fiance. But now the only thing they share are insults and and glares. No matter how much their friends try to mend the edges of their tattered relationship, she doesn't see it ever changing.\n",

      "But now her best friend is getting married and she's stranded without a flight due to a tropical storm. Left with no other option, she agrees to a ride to the wedding from the one man she's determined to avoid at all costs. Forced into closer proximity, it only solidifies one fact for her, as much as she may hate Nate, she still wants him. She may try to feel an attraction to other men, but it's just no use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nate isn't quite the asshole that he seems. Suffering from deep rooted survivor's guilt and wounds from his last tour, the last thing he feels a woman like Lilly needs is a broken man like him. So he does his best to push her away. There's just one problem with that; every insult that flies between them only seems to heat his blood more. There's no denying he still wants the beautiful blonde, and he's not going to take the barb flying from her mouth sitting down.\n",

She’d rather have a root canal than spend fifteen hours in a truck with him, but things are really not going her way in this case. Faced with missing her best friend’s wedding or catching a riding with Nate, she must put aside her feelings, suck it up, and take the trip. Lily will just have to save her murderous plans for after the wedding!\n",

Nate is still reeling from survivor guilt after a horrible helicopter accident, and he doesn’t feel worthy of Lily or entitled to any happiness she might bring. He re-enlisted in the Marines and is set to go back on duty in just two short weeks, so he knows he must keep his distance in this road trip. A road trip he knows is sure to stretch his will power and control to the limits.\n",

We get a peak at these two and I’d like to see how their romance started. Both of these stories are only .99 cents, a steal of a deal!\n",

      "The Stolen Ones is the 7th installment of Richard Montanari's novels featuring Philadelphia Detectives Jessica Balzano and Kevin Byrne. These detectives have been are brought in on a case after a wealthy businessman was found murdered in Priory Park. Before long, a series of murders and a mute two-year old girl bring them up against a man named Luther. Luther is the one person left behind after the closing of the Delaware Valley State Hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off let me start by saying that I am so happy to finally become acquainted with this author. is the definition of what I look for in crime fiction. The pace is fast, characters are interesting, and the thrills come often. At times it felt I was reading a horror novel mixed with crime fiction, topped off with psychological suspense. And thankfully, those independant genres fuse well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Montanari does well to provide a 7th novel that doesn't read like there's something missing. There isn't a whole chunk of history in the two starring detectives lives that is eluded to and breezed over making the reader feel confused. Both Balzano and Byrne are well developed, interesting, and complementing of each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the novel shifts between the past and present, we are introduced to a man named Luther and the people who crossed his path... for better or worse. His preferred travel method makes for some sleepless nights in the hopes of nothing being in my closet. Seriously. This novel had the perfect amount of suspense and sheer creepiness that I tried to steal a moment whenever I could to get back to the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, by Richard Montanari is a great way to spend the day reading. It fuses many genres seamlessly and introduces the world of dreams to the unsuspecting. This is one nightmare I would never want to live through. I look forward to reading more by this author.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Before I write this review, I need to clarify 2 things.\n",
      "Firstly, I love Montanari's books, I eagerly await them every year.\n",
      "Secondly, I am a psychiatrist.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regards to the book; fast paced, with Montanari's usual variety of perspectives. The characters have grown and developed throughout the series, but remain true. As can be expected, there is a roller-coaster-ride's worth of plot twists; however, some are predictable and based on Montanri's own work, there are tricks he has tried before.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regards to psychiatry. Where does this research come from? Yes, I know full well that psychiatry has a very checkered past, but this depiction lives up to a stereotype previously seen in Shutter Island. Yes, psych hospitals tend to be large; no, catacombs are not routine. Yes, some patients never recover fully but most do. Chronic patients are usually placed in group facilities. Male and female patients are separate. Staff know there patients. As for the dream experiments, it's an interesting concept- the transfer of the unconscious from one person to another; but not possible. Psychiatry is a medical profession, Drs and nurses who treat patients. This dark- glamour attached to psychiatry may be related to its past (pre medication) but is continually perpetuated my books and films that explore only this depiction and no other.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I often buy books that are marked down in price. They are just so pricy these days. I have to admit I have a knack of finding what I like without knowing too much about them. Goodreads though is helping me become more and more aware of books that I think I will like so hunting has gotten a bit easier. With regard to this book though I just saw it marked at $6 and read the captioning and was intrigued. I had no idea that it was number 7 in a series so lets get that out of the way because that doesn't matter at all. The book has an intriguing premise dealing with dreams and a former psychatric hospital where things went bad. It deals with the underground networking of a city (tunnels and the like through the waterways). Having worked at a mall it is reminiscent of the behind the scenes hallways for moving incoming goods into a mall. I have read a few books that deal with this aspect of the city. I think Montanari stretched it a bit with then being able to get into the houses but I tend to roll with fiction and give quite a bit of leeway. I won't put up with utter nonsense but to me this aspect was kind of intriguing. I enjoyed this book quite a bit. I even appreciated the formatting with regard to it. I read this after reading 1450 pages of The Stand with very small print and small pages. The type set, spacing and overall breath of the book was much appreciated. It something I kind have always been aware of when buying a book but after The Stand I appreciate it even more. If you want an easy, intriguing read then have a read of this one. I will definitely be following up on this series!\n",

      "When The Stolen Ones opens, Jessica Balzano is in law school and eventually plans to leave the force, but she still works in the Special Investigations Unit in homicide. She catches a case that involves a businessman, Robert Freitag, who was found in Priory Park in early 2013 with a railroad spike through the head. His apartment has been sealed until now, and of course Jessica jumps at the chance to gather more evidence. The only problem is, the evidence they do have (which is minimal and at times, nonsensical) was put together by the detective working the case at the time, John Garcia, who suffered from a brain tumor that eventually killed him. She and her partner, Kevin Byrne, first visit the original crime scene, then head to Freitag’s apartment, where they uncover a few things that might have a chance of leading them to his killer. Meanwhile, a man named Luther roams Philadelphia’s underground, and his ties to a killer named Eduard Kross is leading him to his next victims. When more bodies start to appear in Priory Park, the case ramps up very, very fast. If things weren’t already strange enough, a mute little girl is found in the middle of the road with ties to a past case, and a retired detective is pulled back into a nightmare that he never escaped from.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my first experience with Detectives Kevin Byrne and Jessica Balzano of the Philadelphia Police Dept., and it certainly won’t be my last. In fact, I plan to catch up the first six as soon as I can! Most of the narrative follows Balzano and Byrne as they pick apart the puzzle that is Luther, but we also get glimpses into Luther’s past at Cold River, where he was born into very tragic circumstances, and of the diabolical dream studies and experiments that were conducted there. The making of a killer is a fascinating thing, and Montanari tackles the subject, and his detectives’ race against the clock to catch him, like the seasoned pro that he is. I like the fact that Balzano is a smart, busy wife and mother who is trying to get her law degree in addition to her day job, and she does it with dedication and humor (and more than a little exhaustion.) Byrne is quiet and methodical and the two form a great partnership, one of absolute trust and loyalty. As a newcomer to the series, I never felt that I was missing anything I needed in order to fully enjoy the story, so it can definitely stand on its own. If you enjoy creepy thrillers that move at a blistering pace and have more than their share of the macabre, THE STOLEN ONES should be on your must read list. Also, the ending gave me chills-can’t wait for the next one!\n",

      "Excellent entry in the Byrne-Balzano series about the lasting effects of secret medical experiments that took place at a now-closed mental hospital some twenty years ago and the hospital's connection to a series of murders. Gripping from beginning to end and filled with enough police procedural talk to please the most die hard enthusiast. The epilogue was a bit of a stretch, but that's just minor quibbling. Solid effort throughout, and fans of Montanari will be happy they picked this one up. 4.5 stars. Highly recommended.\n",

      "This was so good! I really loved this story! I’m so happy we finally got to read about Charlie and her Dragon! After seeing her get snatched in the other ladies books it was good to finally see things from Charlie’s perspective. Dragix story was so sad. I mean damn, Hope took us on a feels trip so many times during this story. I’m kinda sad he lost his immortality over this and also Maez I guess will lose hers. The other human women are pure stupid. Sorry, I need to say this. I can tell Sarissa is going to be 100% annoying and a pain in the rear. Tell me stupid humanoid, WHO IS GOING TO FLY THIS SPACESHIP? Hmmm ? Who is going to fix it? How will you navigate? Where is argon in relation to earth? How do you know the grivath and the purple guys just won’t ambush you in space and retake you? So many variables and unknowns and their stubborn stupidity they don’t think about this. They just want their way and will push their thoughts upon their rescuers and make others lives miserable... hmmm, sounds like a bunch of democrats... 🤔🤔🤫🤫 I wonder hahaha anyways. I truly loved this book. I think Zoey needs to stop whining and step up to the plate. You’re a nurse. You don’t need to be a warrior. Hang out with Moni and be a healer. If tagiz doesn’t see what’s in front of his face then that’s his loss. Also, play the game. Flirt with another warrior. We know braxians won’t tolerate that. Look how hes already playing helicopter mom. Can you imagine him watching her flirt eTc? Nah bruh. But she’s playing the poor me game. Don’t be something you’re not for someone else. You’ll never be happy and that person isn’t worth it. Do what you’re good at. Healing and helping is honorable. It’s also needed. Do what you know girl! I’m also shocked after all the intimacy in this book little two leg didn’t end up preggo! I think it would have ended the book nicely since Dragix is the last of his kind. I thought that’s what was going to happen when she went hunting Zoey down. I was so wrong there. Phenomenal series though. Pick it up! Read all of hopes books! Her world building is such a pleasure to read! So amazing! She sucks you into her world and you’re living it with these women and their warriors! Amazing 5⭐️ read!\n",

      "Not very romantic....\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not a fan of stories where everything happens within a matter of days....\n",
      "Emma comes home one day, contents of her house destroyed,Lucas is called ,next day Emma adopts a toothless but amazingly heroic dog with diabetes (who goes from cowering in a corner to growling and barking at any and all perceived threats) , goes to check on her house 🏡 argues with Lucas and is almost kidnapped...\n",
      "Emma suffers a small fall/tumble when trying to escape the kidnappers, she only suffers minor cuts and scrapes,but for a woman who sounds like she’s in her early to mid 20’s, but she sounds like a much older woman the way these seemingly minor cuts and scrapes have left her barely able to walk or move or even function with out some sort of minor pain relievers every few hours... I found that as odd... Just as is a woman complaining about her poor finances from the very start of the book, who then adopts a dog that needs at least a 100 dollars in insulin ,plus a bit extra for special food because wet/canned food for a toothless dog must be high .... neither thing made sense...\n",
      "Honestly I don’t know what to make of this story.... it all seems to take place in less than a week,I’d say 3-4 days total and most if not all the story is centered on what ever has caused the distraction of the property, the ransacking of her house and the attempted kidnapping, not on the two MC’s renewing their acquaintance and getting to know each other again...\n",
      "Honestly other that her getting angry with him when he finally explains why he pulled what he did they barely talk to each other at all...\n",
      "This. So. Is. NOT. Romantic. AT. ALL!\n",
      "Nothing even remotely “happens” between them til after 80% of the book... Lucas decides after Emma’s life is threatened yet again in one of the last chapters, he can’t let her go and agrees to give their relationship a chance after all but since Emma is still so incredibly sore from her scraped knees still he thinks they should just cuddle and wait on sex,Emma’s response ? “You’re staying? Even though, you know… we’re not doing it?” she asked,\n",
      "I rolled my eyes,at this ... Seriously ? The man has been taking care of you for days and has just decided to give a relationship a try after keeping you from getting killed multiple times,but your not putting out so you think he’s leaving ? It just struck me as odd,like soo many things here...\n",
      "Supposedly these two already had a relationship established as “friends” and neighbors before they slept together but I didn’t feel it... I didn’t feel the chemistry,or a connection or anything here.... they just fell really flat to me.. like a bunch of stock characters that all thrown together were supposed to make some thing special...like one those soup mixes where maybe you just add water and some meat,but instead of making soup 🍲,you just got some slightly flavored meat water...\n",
      "There are lots and lots and lots of stores out there in the romance genre with Navy SEALs featured and I’m sure there are much better ones out there.... I’ve read plenty in Harlequin alone....\n",
      "The only character I truly liked in the story was “Cuddles” The diabetic wonder dog,who oddly enough not only bonds super quick to her new owner in a matter of hours ( supposedly your new owner almost getting kidnapped will do that) but she also becomes an ace guard dog and a few days later can and will chase you across town and subdue potential killers with only her strong gums and nails... (she was supposed to be washed after she got her from the shelter,but I'm not sure she ever was and that's NOT a smell you can just ignore)\n",
      "Not a romantic story and the one sex scene at 90% of the book was beyond forgettable...\n",

      "3.5 stars - After an erotic, sex-filled weekend together that promised to develop into something more, Lucas decides to take a step back from Emma. She's too tempting, too delicious, too deserving of a better life than he can give her as a SEAL. The temptation to call her is removed when his team is deployed. Emma felt certain she would hear from the hot, gorgeous Lucas after spending a weekend in his king-sized bed. But her phone didn't ring, and her calls were not returned. To add injury to insult, the new home she purchased on impulse isn't all it was advertised to be. And now, someone has broken in and ransacked it, destroying everything in the process. Nothing was stolen so what were they looking for? A friend of Lucas's is the investigating cop and when he suspects Emma's life is in danger, he calls Lucas who is now back in town. Sparks fly when Lucas rides in to Emma and thus the fun begins.\n",

Short on pages, but another Must Read!\n",

      "5 ESSENTIAL QUALITIES OF A COMPELLING HEADLINE\n",
      "The headlines and subheads in your sales copy (and the post titles you choose for your blog and email subject lines) serve the same purpose as headlines in a newspaper or magazine. They either draw the reader in, or they push the reader away.\n",
      "Here are five essential qualities of a compelling headline:\n",
      "1. Grabs Attention. Your headline’s number-one job is to grab the reader’s attention. To accomplish this, your headline must either: make a claim or promise, evoke an emotional response, or stir up curiosity.\n",
      "Examples\n",
      "Can You Really Be Younger Next Year?\n",
      "Which Of These Five Mistakes Do You Make on Your Blog?\n",
      "2. Screens and Qualifies Readers. Choose specific words that segment out the exact “tribe” you want to reach. Headlines that apply to everyone can just as easily apply to no one.\n",
      "Examples:\n",
      "Why New Authors Fail, and What to Do about It\n",
      "Top 10 iPad Apps For Entrepreneurs\n",
      "3. Draws Readers into the Body Copy. Remember you’re not selling your concept or proposition in the headline. You’re making one sale only: the idea of reading the rest of the post.\n",
      "Examples:\n",
      "How to Write a Book in Seven Days\n",
      "Does God Want You to Be Rich?\n",
      "4. Communicates the “Big Idea.” What is the one true benefit of your post, and how can you communicate that to your readers in a way that is meaningful to them? Put that in your headline.\n",
      "Examples:\n",
      "Triple Your Productivity Instantly\n",
      "The Customer Is Not Always Right\n",
      "5. Establishes Credibility. Authority is one of the most powerful ways of gaining attention. If you have an “authority card” to play, play it in the headline if possible.\n",

      "1. Use E-mail Marketing to Build Permission-Based Lists. Prospects who give you permission to market to them are most likely to buy. Honor (and widen) the circle of permission.\n",
      "2. Use a Reputable E-mail Delivery Service. If your e-mail doesn’t get delivered, you won’t make any sales; getting it delivered is a full-time job.\n",
      "3. Give Web Visitors Reasons To Opt- In, And Set Their Expectations Properly. You must offer some sort of premium to entice visitors to give up their names and e-mail addresses.\n",
      "4. Avoid Spam Complaints with Frequent, Consistent Mailings. Surprising as it sounds, mailing more often can reduce spam complaints.\n",
      "5. Use Autoresponders as Robotic Sales Agents. A sequence of contacts is a powerful way of delivering your sales message.\n",
      "6. Give People an Unusually Great Reason To Opt- In. Work harder than other marketers to create Lead Magnets of Unusual Value.\n",
      "7. Give People Great Reasons to Stay On Your List. Don’t take it for granted that anybody is interested in reading your next email. Give them a reason to want to read it.\n",
      "8. Ask for a “Sale” in Every E-mail. Treat each e-mail like a miniature sales letter; just be clear what the call to action is for that particular e-mail. Get them in the habit of clicking on your links!\n",
      "9. Craft a Powerful Signature File for All E-mails. This is a powerful action device. Don’t forget it.\n",
      "10. Use Broadcast E-mails for Promotions. Broadcasts are great for promotions and launch sequences (time-bound offers).\n",
      "11. Know Your Most Wanted Response. If you don’t know it, how can you elicit the desired behavior?\n",
      "12. Use Only One MWR Per Email. The confused mind never buys.\n",
      "13. Craft Subject Lines Using the PAC Formula. Write your subject lines so that they are personal, fulfill anticipation, and arouse curiosity.\n",
      "14. Start Each E-mail with Undeniable, Confirmable Truth. For instance, you might start with the date; subtle credibility.\n",
      "15. Use Headline Techniques, but Not Headline Formatting. Avoid making your e-mail look like an ad.\n",
      "16. Put the Main Benefit in the Lead, with a Link. The first paragraph is the lead, and you should have a link to your MWR in that paragraph (or following it).\n",
      "17. Use a PS That Summarizes the Main Benefit and Provides a Link. Just like in your sales letter, the PS may be the only copy in your e-mail the prospect reads.\n",
      "18. Place a Minimum of 3 Links to Your Call to Action in the E-mail Body. The first two will get most of the clicks.\n",
      "19. Send Short E-mails That Create Zeigarnik Effect. Your MWR is most likely to get the prospect to visit a Web page.\n",
      "20. Send Emails That Look Like They Were Sent by a Friend. You want your emails to look like those of a friend, not like sales fliers or newspaper ads.\n",

      "A bullet point is simply a one or two-line sentence that’s defined by a bullet, a round circle, a checkmark, or perhaps a little box next to it, that sets it apart from the rest of the text. The reason for using bullets in our copy is very simple.\n",
      "Earlier, we discussed the fact that there are three things people never do when first reading your copy. They never read anything at first; they never believe anything at first; and they never do or buy anything at first.\n",
      "We know they don’t read your copy. They skim the copy. They scan through it. They scroll through it. To get them to start reading, we use devices to capture their attention. One of those devices is the headline. That’s what gets their attention initially to get them to read the rest of the ad, copy, or sales page.\n",

A blind bullet is a bullet that tantalizes your reader with a curiosity-inducing statement, yet does not reveal the actual secret behind it, in effect setting up an “open loop” that the mind longs to complete. A void of curiosity that leaves the reader thinking, “I want to know the answer behind that particular bullet.” That is one of the things that make bullets so incredibly effective.

      "5. The “Reverse Hook” Bullet. Interesting fact plus unexpected benefit.\n",
      "6. The “Naked Benefit” Bullet. This bullet makes a direct benefit claim, but it must be supported by some additional facts or intrigues that deepen your reader’s interest.\n",
      "7. The “Transactional” Bullet. Simple transaction: “Give me ... and I’ll give you...”\n",

      "\n",
      "Four innocent young ladies-in-waiting to the Princess of Wales spend the night sheltering from a wild party in her residence – only to discover in the morning that Her Highness was never there. And the news is already out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ladies flee the scene to fight as best they can for their lost reputations. And to confront the man who tricked them.\n",
      "\n",
      "If her reputation is false, is his?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hazel is ruined. With no money, no near family, and the stagecoach to her old governess’s home vanishing into the distance, she is forced to accept the help of the one man she never wished to set eyes on again.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Hazel, the handsome and respected diplomat Sir Joseph Sayle is an infamous rake who took advantage of the princess she served. She hates his arrogance as much as his inexplicable effect on her senses. Under normal circumstances she would never have dreamed of setting foot in his curricle, least of all when he was, by his own admission, “not entirely sober” after a night’s carousing.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the journey in his relaxed company is unexpectedly fun, and when they reach their destination and are threatened by a parcel of eccentric children with a pistol, he enters the adventure with enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems Sir Joe is much more than the man Hazel thought him. Amusing, kind, and passionate, he and his elegant pursuit provide exciting distractions to her woes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But flirting with him is a dangerous game, and by the time they face the trickster responsible for her ruin, her heart is already lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "My review :\n",
      "\n",
      "Will her ruin lead her to her salvation...\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing better than be at the beginning of a series, no feelings of having missed something, no regret to have not read the book before, no visiting characters as everyone is newly introduced.\n",
      "I have read quite a lot of regency stories, and few to none where with the Princess of Wales as a “side character”, as even if she is not physically present, she is part of the plot. Every regency set story mentions Prinny but near to none his estranged wife. Plus, while I have read some romances with ladies-in-waiting, I quite thought it was a custom of the past, well something before the XIXth century. But of course, there are royals, so there is a court with its lot of courtiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hazel and Joe courtship was quite sweet, while Hazel after her first encounter with him labeled him as a rake, and tried to avoid his presence. When in time of need, he is the only one to step in and help her.\n",
      "And very soon, she realizes everything she thought about him was only preconceived ideas. He is his reputation but also a kind and caring man, not one to hesitate to give a hand when necessary.\n",
      "Joe knows his relationship with Hazel was strained by their first meeting, she dislikes everything he represents.\n",
      "But the more time they spend time together, the more she lets her enmity shows. Revealing the fair and thoughtful woman she is.\n",
      "This is a journey of discovery for them, where they bury the past and their false assumptions to open their heart to something they did not expect.\n",
      "Both are very likable characters and while I did not agree with Hazel last move, I also understand why, because it was a considerate choice.\n",
      "Mrs Lancaster gifts us with a lovely tale of seing past society’s lenses.\n",
      "I hope we will see again Selim.\n",

      "I was granted an advance copy by the publisher Dragonblade Publishing, here is my true and unbiased opinion.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "After accidentally spending a night unchaperoned at an out-of-control party, Hazel tries to escape to safety with her former governess, but finds herself instead with a diplomat and a passel of children.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a quick, enjoyable read with a dashing hero and a sensible heroine, a dastardly villain and a fair amount of humor and heart. The leads are well-suited to each other and I appreciated their sense of adventure. There are a fair number of subplots though, some of them so minor I despair of them being tied up in the rest of the series.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I'm definitely reading the rest, subplots addressed or not!\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I received an arc of this via netgally to review.\n",
      "I feel like 3 stars doesn't convey very well that I did enjoy this book for the most part. It was very easy to read and it had a lot of the elements of historical romances that I tend to enjoy. It just didn't rise to the level of originality and storytelling where I felt like I would rate it 4 stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first part of this book started off a bit too fast for me. There was so much going on in the first part of this book and I would have preferred for their to be a little bit more establishment of the characters of Joe and Hazel. The fact that the beginning of the book was so quick made it hard for me to feel like I really knew the characters that well throughout the whole book.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we did learn about Hazel and Joe I did really like. I liked seeing the way they interacted with the people around them, especially the children. I think that can be one of the best ways to introduce their personality to the reader and I think that has done well here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought the plot with the Lord was interesting but a little messy at parts. I never got a really good sense of his motivation and I wish his reasoning was expanded upon a bit more so I could understand it more. I also felt like some of the other side plots felt a little disjointed and it made the book almost seen it was originally a collection of short stories. I also thought this was slightly repetitive in some parts. I think that may be partially due to its length because I felt like it could have been a bit shorter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also just something minor, it seems like this series will follow all four of the ladies who were stuck at this party at the beginning of this book but we don't get to know any of those other ladies in this book. In romance series set up like this, I like to get to know the characters that will get their own books so I'm excited for their stories, but that's a minor complaint.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know if I would read more books in this series but I think I would consider reading more books by this author. This was pretty good and I liked it for this most part, it just wasn't quite a four star read for me.\n",

      "Well... I came in to this expecting a paranormal gay romance, but -despite the author's efforts to add a story line and paranormal elements to the book- it pretty much was just porn with plot.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems that the only parts the author took great care with were the sex scenes. And there were a lot of them. Sex in the bedroom, sex in public, sex after just having escaped death, sex between the main couple, sex with everyone else. At a certain point the main character reflected the following: “I'm starting to think that fucking is a like a handshake around here.”. And didn't that just perfectly sum up the book?\n",
      "Safe to say: sex (not even romance) is the focus of this story. Solid world building, character development and common sense all took the backseat.\n",
      "The plot -if we can call it that- was all over the place, with events occurring, people showing up and definitions (hunters!- what the hell were they?) being mentioned seemingly at random.\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn't relate to the main character at all, and not only because Peter was an egocentric, slow on the uptake nymphomaniac, but also because the thoughts and emotions weren't relatable or described well. There was a total lack of tension and an abundance of stilted or corny dialogues with everything just seeming to happen haphazardly.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're looking for a hot read and you're willing to overlook everything else, this is a good book for you.\n",

      "Apparently being a vampire means having a lot of sex. Also apparently if a vampire feeds from you enough your body chemistry is realigned so you also have a lot of sex (I'm pretty sure that's a cultural construct though, not a physiological one). I could barely keep track of the coupling, recoupling, tripling, re-tripling...\n",
      "\n",
      "What I liked is that this is joyful, happy, caring sex. These guys use sex to express liking each other, caring for each other, being someone's boss, being someone's subordinate, saying hello, saying welcome back, and just being happy that they're in the same room together. It's always consensual, always pleasureable. Plus it's well-written sex. I in this sex.\n",

      "Even though it's 2% plot, 98% sex, I'll be checking out the sequels when I want a read that requires no thought whatsoever.\n",

      "The bond between Peter and Lucien is strong right at the beginning: i liked both of them a lot but i was really glad that Peter wasn't a pet in this story. He is strong-minded and a real human-alpha that matches Lucien in every part of their relationship. He is a real equal to the vampire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucien is what i would call an \"adorable\" master vampire (lol) with all the darkness around him: he is stubborn, overbearing, masterful but so much in love and insecure. Can't help but fall for him...\n",
      "\n",
      "The pace of the story was really good and it is really well written.\n",

      "We are talking about a hot master vampire that is always on tight leather pants, and all creatures of his coven (vampires, werewolves and shifters) are hot guys on tight leather pants... hot and horny guys on tight leather pants... get my point?\n",
      "I take the risk of saying a cliché but So, imagine Peter going to live with Lucien and a bunch of horny fantastic creatures.\n",
      "In my mind while Peter talk about that house (only Peter narrate the book) I imagine Lucien as Hugh Hefner (a young and hot Hugh...) but instead of girls of playboy magazines we are talking of hot gays creatures whiling to serve Peter and Lucien... so yeah... ménages à trois, voyeurism, BDSM... you name it and I will say: \"yeah, happen on this book\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing. It's a erotic book, so obviously it's incredible hot, but it's also a sweet love story! Lucien and Peter love is so beautiful! They are equals, and this means how much they love each other! Lucien don't try to command Peter, but to show his love, so what Peter describe is so wonderful! It's truly (sorry, cliché again) two soul mates together!\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend this also to who never read a M/M novel. It's a marvelous experience that you should try it! And this book is perfect! The book will show you M/M love scenes, but it's not only that! This book is about ! Simple as that... what matter if it's a M/M book or not? Love is the important message this book explore, so do it! Read about true love!\n",

      "Peter, a bartender at a local club, sees a man on the dance floor and is immediately drawn to him. They share a dance but the man disappears before Peter is able to speak with him. Peter continues to see him at the club and comes to learn that this mystery guy is a vampire. Vampires are known in society but Peter has an unhealthy fear of them. He once walked into The Den, the local vampire club, and stumbled upon a horrific scene that he hasn’t been able to get passed. After much persuading, the vampire, Lucien, gets Peter to agree to see him. Peter realizes that not only is Lucien a vampire, but the Master vampire of the city and the owner of The Den.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being with a master vampire comes with its own responsibilities. It automatically puts Peter into a position of power that he’s not sure he’s ready for. Peter is forced to see things that he doesn’t understand. Lucien is very patient in letting Peter come to terms with the violent vampire world but eventually has had enough of his fear and lack of trust. This forces Peter to choose. And choose he does. Once he decided that he was going to be Lucien’s partner he took his position by the reins. He became a strong, caring and decisive leader for their coven. It was as though he was meant to be a partner to Lucien in leading their coven.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I loved both the MC’s passion and chemistry with each other there was a lot of fighting and bickering. I am a fan of some good banter, but this didn’t feel like banter, just bickering. All the back and forth between them was tiring. I did appreciate that there weren’t any secrets between them. They were very honest with each other, which of course led to the constant battles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holy hotness there was a lot of sex in this book. It was like one constant orgy. Everyone just had sex with and fed from everyone! There was blood and cum all over the damn place it seemed. The sex was hot but I prefer for the couple to only be with each other, as opposed to a rotating door of lovers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loved the world building, loved the characters and although I don’t see a change in the sexual dynamic of their household, I think I can handle some hot ménage man lovin’ if I have to. So twist my arm and, yes, I will be reading more of this series.\n",

      "I know I usually review fiction and this is a cookery book, but I have a weakness for cookery books – a passion, actually – with the emphasis being on delicious baked goods. When I’m stressed, I bake. And so I was intrigued to learn that the bestselling fiction author, Marian Keyes, actually used baking to haul herself out of a deep depression. And be honest. Who could possibly resist a pink-covered cookery book titled Saved By Cake, over 80 ways to bake yourself happy.\n",

      "When I buy cookery books, I like to have a bit more than recipes and pictures to go at. Memoirs, funny tales, explanatory notes – they all add to the experience and the pleasure aspect of simply being able to a cookery book. Some of my favourite food writers are Nigella Lawson and Nigel Slater for that very reason. You can imagine my delight when I found to include all sorts of delightful insights into MK’s life.\n",

      "This is some of the most entertaining food porn I've ever read, which considering it was written by someone struggling with severe depression is quite an achievement. (Incidentally, I don't eat sweets, so this really is food porn for me.) Keyes took to baking as a way to get her mind off the Unbearable Meaninglessness of It All, so although some of these recipes get quite gourmet and complicated, she's coming at it from the ordinary person perspective, and explains all the little fiddly bits so that you know what to expect. And she's just fun to read.\n",

      "Keyes gives you a great sense of what each recipe is like. For example, her Orange and Fennel Tuiles are described as melt-in-the-mouth, sort of like orange-and-fennel-flavored-air. The recipe ends: \"Serve to people who don't really believe in eating.\" At the other extreme is the \"Black Hole\" Chocolate Cheesecake: \"so called because it's so dense it seems to collapse under the weight of its own fabulousness. Eating a slice of this is like being punched in the stomach with a chocolate-flavored fist.\"\n",

      "Naturally, when I was that the Founder of Vans, Paul Van Doren, was writing a book, I knew I wanted to hear his story. Did I really care about shoe production? Not really. But I was intrigued by the history of how and why Vans was created. Skaters embraced the Vans brand and Vans was willing to listen to what they wanted. Tony Alva, one of the original Z-Boys came into a Vans storefront and begged to just buy one shoe. Other skaters came in asking for better ankle protection, thus the SK8-Hi and jazz stripe was born. Vans realized they were really the only shoe company tackling the needs of extreme sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "But more than that, Vans was the biggest family company around. Paul Van Doren rounded up all his kids and siblings and in-laws and created a company that would not exist without the help of the entire family. Which is why Vans relies on families. They rely on their workers, the whole team has always felt like a family.\n",

      "Hurrah! I have good reason to celebrate. I read Libbie Hawker’s debut novel, The Sekhmet Bed, back when it was released, and had mixed feelings about it. It was seriously unpolished, but I felt as though I could catch glimpses of great writing potential within. Well, you know how the old adage about too many books too little time goes: I only recently had a chance to pick up with the immediate sequels rounding out Hawker’s Hatshepsut quartet, and I hate to say it but they were disappointing. They suffered from the same problems as the debut: pacing was a big issue, which in turn affected characterisation, and while in places the description was inspired, Hawker never seemed to let loose with it. I mentioned in my reviews of those that I planned to check out her other series, as I hadn’t lost hope that Hawker’s full potential could be realised, but I honestly didn’t know how that was going to play out. I’ve read plenty of authors whose quality remains the same book to book, whether that be brilliant, mediocre, or downright terrible. I’ve even read series where the author’s quality of writing mysteriously manages to go downhill (I’m not entirely sure how – perhaps initial success led to a slackening of the editing reins and a certain overconfident apathy). I haven’t read too many authors where the glint of promise amid a dubious start was realised later down the line. Libbie Hawker is one of them. (Thank goodness. What, do you think I read bad books for fun? Okay, writing snarky reviews is fun. But what I earnestly wish for is to discover a new Pauline Gedge or Sharon Penman every time I take a chance on a new author. That would be wonderful.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I am so relieved and happy upon finishing this book – first in a trilogy about the Amarna period. It’s like every wish I had for Libbie has come true. The writing is a dream. Well, okay, I mustn’t get carried away and gush too much – I do have one or two small areas for improvement to comment upon – but seriously this is exactly what I wanted. The vivid, transporting imagery, that previously peeked out occasionally in the Hatshepsut quartet, is consistent through the entire book; lush and imaginative and whisking me away to ancient Egypt. This is what I like to see! A little linguistic flex and playfulness; creative flair to keep my brain alert and engaged on every page. So few authors, even ones who have a good story on their hands, do this, but for me it is a must have to elevate a book to the upper echelons. I was in raptures of delight. The quality was great.\n",
      "\n",
      "The major problems that were in evidence previously are swept away. It’s evident from the rich descriptions that Hawker is finally taking her time in letting the story speak, unhurried, so it should come as no surprise when I saw the pacing is smooth and measured here. It’s almost perfectly spot on – apart from one moment where we leap ahead to Nefertiti giving birth at the beginning of one chapter having been not even pregnant in the previous chapter. It was a bit of a blip, but nothing like the time jumps in the Hatshepsut quartet, and it is a very sparingly used device, making it much easier for me to forgive and move on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The characterisations are miles better too. Multiple protagonists give the book a broader feel than the small cast of the Hatshepsut quartet, lending the world much more believability and scope. And Hawker clearly understands the ambiguity of antagonism here in a much subtler way. Her protagonists each have stories that evoke the reader’s empathy, motivations which naturally place them at cross purposes without compromising that empathy, and the capacity to adapt to events and forge and break alliances that keep the dynamics between them fresh and the audience interested in authentic feeling relationships based on character growth and change as opposed to static personalities in fixed roles where the story fundamentals stay the same. She chooses four strong female characters as her protagonists and POVs: Tiy, Nefertiti, Kiya, and Sitamun. It is glorious to see all four of them take such leading roles and come to life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The historical accuracy and up to date research is very much appreciated as well, and I know from skipping ahead to the author’s note of the third book in this trilogy that Libbie was highly attentive to latest Egyptological developments. However, a caveat: there are still lots of unresolved questions about the Amarna royals, and by necessity an author is forced to make choices in order to write a full story. That means that Libbie’s Amarna royal family may not be your Amarna royal family. I will admit that in my Egyptologist’s mind, I draw different conclusions from the same scant evidence, and so I envision the character personalities, motivations, and dynamics with one another rather differently. For example, I agree with Hawker’s interpretation of Akhenaten’s bodily fitness, the art style being just an art style, but some degree of psychological imbalance being at play. But her Nefertiti is nothing like the one in my ‘most likely scenario’. To be fair, it is extremely difficult to interpret Nefertiti. It depends on whether you think Akhenaten was an inspired visionary or an unbalanced egotist. Then you have a choice of interpreting if Nefertiti went along with it because she was greedy and ambitious, desperate and scared, or had been persuaded to become a true believer. I personally read into the monuments depicting their unusual closeness that she was a genuine believer and loving partner – though perhaps with more of a practical bent than her husband. Hawker, unusually, paints the marriage unhappily, which is a surprise, but certainly an effective choice for evoking reader empathy for Nefertiti. If I’m honest, none of Hawker’s four protagonists are exactly as I imagine my Amarna royals, with Nefertiti being the most divergent. Did this ruin my immersion? I would say no. Is it my ideal scenario? No. But it is extremely rare that a writer’s vision will exactly tally with our own. When I talk about the importance of historical accuracy to me as a reader, what I really mean is first, don’t put in anything stupid from a different era that clearly doesn’t belong, and second, historical believability. I don’t mind if an author fills in the gaps of history, as long as they don’t fill it in with something that is so off-the-wall implausible that it beggars belief. So your Amarna royals aren’t the same as my Amarna royals? As long as you properly support them with logical motivations and don’t butcher the historical characterisations, I’m happy to play in your sandbox.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of historical accuracy… I must mention one or two tiny bloopers that slipped through the net. Sugar, lemons, and night-blooming jasmine all appear: the two former didn’t appear in Egypt until c. 700 CE (2000 years after the Amarna era), while the flower comes from the West Indies and so arrived much later still. Hawker also mentions that princes couldn’t marry sisters, only pharaohs, but several of Ramesses the Great’s sons did do this – although after the time of Akhenaten, so she can plausibly get away with this.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to my criticisms. Aside from the minor anachronism bloopers and time jump blip mentioned above, if I had one criticism it was that I felt the story could have benefitted from broadening its perspective. Although it was great to have four strong female protagonists, I did feel like I was missing out on some key perspectives that I would’ve considered it important to include: Akhenaten, Ay, possibly Thutmose, Smenkhkare (not in this book maybe, but in later books when older). I just feel they deserved to be protagonists (and possibly Sitamun and Kiya could’ve been cut and moved to secondary characters instead, as their parts weren’t as significant). Not only did I think the book missed out on their perspectives, but as a direct result of having four protagonists who are all queens, the story is in some degree hampered by the restrictions on the lives of these women and the importance of events happening outside their experience. Put me in the throne room with Akhenaten and his advisors, please!\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, for all those wondering, I admit I still prefer Pauline Gedge’s more. I think it has that broader perspective, and to be succinct it just has a darkly delicious and compelling core running through it that is tough to beat (Hawker’s Amarna royals are dark… but not that dark. Not yet, anyway). But this has to be the next best take I’ve ever read. Good job, indeed!\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Hawerk's Book of Coming Forth series is about the Amarna period in ancient Egypt. This first chronicles the in-fighting that occurs as one pharaoh passes and another rises. The book is told from the relative perspectives of the women in the story (the pov is third, but the focus of each chapter shifts) making a rather good illustration about how power or its pursuit can cost one potential allies.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The Amarna period is one of my most favourite periods of time in Ancient Egyptian history and one that has been well-served by a fairly steady stream of historical fiction about it. I've ended up reading a fair amount of novels set in this time – but I've never found a novel that really satisfied me.\n",

      "\n",
      "is the first volume in Libbie Hawker's , a series that explores the reign of Akhenaten and the rise and fall of the Aten faith. This first part focuses on the last two years of Amenhotep III's reign and the first five years of Akhenaten's reign. Events are told through the eyes of four royal women, Tiye (mother of Akhenaten and Amenhotep III's Great Royal Wife), Nefertiti (daughter of the ambitious Ay, wife to Akhenaten), Kiya (a Mitanni princess married to first Amenhotep III and later Akhenaten) and Sitamun (daughter of Tiye and Amenhotep, wed first to Amenhotep III and then Akhenaten).\n",
      "\n",
      "It's tempting to compare this to Pauline Gedge's , one of the best books I've read about Akhenaten and the Amarna period. and both feature bleak takes on this time period and both follow the \"Akhenaten-is-crazypants-crazy-and-a-total-pervert\" line of things. And yet they're so different and do their own thing with the history involved. Personally, I prefer simply because I found it a more enjoyable read. With I felt I was swimming through a sea of murk and while things aren't any better for the characters in House of Rejoicing, I didn't have the same sense of being buried in terrible things and surrounded by terrible people.\n",
      "\n",
      "I credit this to Hawker's character work. All of her characters come across as likeable – or at least understandable – in spite of their flaws and their sometimes terrible actions. All four women frustrated and/or horrified me at least one point in the novel, but I still found myself liking them and hoping that they would have some type of happy ending or at least some triumph (I know the history too well to get my hopes high, though).\n",

      "I have to take a moment to praise Hawker's characterisation of Nefertiti. So often I've seen treatments of Nefertiti that depict her as either a dumb beauty, a ruthless schemer or an implausibly perfect queen that it's refreshing to see her presented as a woman who was highly intelligent and incredibly powerful but not some perfect little snowflake that doesn't do anything wrong or a utterly selfish and unlikeable woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "So too did I enjoy Hawker's exploration of the relationships between all four women. Tiye, Kiya, Sitamun and Nefertiti live in a world where a woman's status and power is derived from their closeness to the king. To put another way: the four women at the centre of the novel live in a world and system that constantly pits women against each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would easy to write the relationships between Sitamun, Nefertiti and Kiya as a rivalry. They are all in competition to become the Great Royal Wife and to give Akhenaten a heir (who will turn secure their position when Akhenaten is dead). And yet they're never rivals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kiya and Sitamun come across as friends, and while Nefertiti holds herself at a distance to them, she still views them sympathetically (and the reverse also is true). This is quite refreshing to read, since so often historical fiction will make this kind of situation into a black-and-white, good guy versus bad guy scenario and forget that that everyone involved is human and have their own reasons for acting as they do.\n",
      "\n",
      "As well as crafting characters that feel like real human beings, the Ancient Egypt Hawker recreates is vivid and atmospheric. I really do get the sense that the book takes place in Ancient Egypt at a very specific time – it's not just some generic bit of action played out in a time that could almost be anywhere. There's nowhere else could take place but in Ancient Egypt, no other time it could take place but Akhenaten's lifetime.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will touch on the history. As I've indicated above, this is one of my favourite time periods in all of history, so much so not only do I have a pretty good grasp of the history, I also have my own pet theories about things. I've also read enough of Hawker's other historical fiction novels to feel certain that Hawker does know her stuff and typically has good reasons to diverge from historical fact for the benefit of the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all that being said, I felt very happy with the historical accuracy with the book. I've professed myself on multiple occasions to be weary of the \"Ay as Nefertiti's father\" trope, but Hawker's take on it was fresh and exciting, so much so that I even enjoyed it. Also, I was very excited about seeing Mutbenret, not Mutnodjmet, as Nefertiti's sister – though it did make me wonder what was going to happen with the woman who would become Horemheb's Great Royal Wife (is it a spoiler if we're talking about historical events that take place 3000+ years ago and involve a character that hasn't yet been introduced in the novel?)\n",
      "\n",
      "The one big issue for me is the role of Sitamun. Hawker's Sitamun tends to contradict a lot of what is known historically about her – or at least, how Sitamun is typically talked about by historians. For example, Sitamun was the eldest of at least four daughters of Amenhotep III and Tiye, but in , she's the youngest of three. I'm not condemning Hawker's choice in changing things around, not least because we're only a third of the way through the story, but it did draw me out of the narrative for a quick, 'wait, what' moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "is an excellent read and an exciting start to a series focused on the Amarna period. I can't wait to pick up the sequel (damn it not being July 31 right this second!).\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This novel read almost like a mystery in the twists and turns of the powerful female characters and their attempts at strengthening their position in Egypt.\n",

      "With so many well-drawn characters and power struggles woven into this book, I can't wait to read the followup novels in the series.\n",

      "Interesting novel on the beginning of Akhenaten and Nefertti's reign. This was told from several different views from women in ancient Egypt. I did enjoy this novel and recommend this to anyone who loves to read about ancient Egypt.\n",

      "I did not like this book. I almost DNF'd a few times. This is about Reid and Ever- they were best friends growing up but Ever was 4 years younger than Reid. She was in love with him and he was in love with her and planning to claim her when she turned 18. They did not know they loved each other. How does Reid show his love? By chasing away all the boys that show her any interest while he whores around casually. One of his f*ck buddies gets pregnant on purpose. How you ask? We never find out- maybe he didn't use protection or maybe she had a condom with holes. Either way tells me he wasn't in charge of protection. Ever runs to another state for college because she has no idea he loves her and he is a single parent at this point. Well she runs a week before her 18th birthday so Reid never tells her he loves her. She ignores his calls because it's too painful for her to just be his friend. He lets her go when she doesn't answer his calls- never flies to see her and declare his love. 4 years later she is back and he decides he might pursue her or at least have sex with her. He actually tells her he likes that her boobs are bigger now. Throw in a stalker for Ever, her cheating ex wanting her back and his crazy baby mama and it's a hot mess of cliches. And everyone feels bad for him for having a crazy baby mama- no one calls him on it and says that's what can happen when you have sex with random strangers dummy! He never really owns up that it takes 2 to make a baby and he made the decision to have sex with that girl more than once. Also continued to have casual sex after he was raising his son. Not as often as he would like- his last hookup was 6 months before Ever came back. He feels sorry for himself at one point because as a single dad he doesn't get enough\"Reid time\" to go out with friends, pick up a girl and get laid and then go on with his life the next morning. I didn't like this guy at all. Ever seemed like an easy way to give his son a mom. Reid knew her, was attracted to her, and his son really liked her- it seemed convenient to me. I guess Reid loved her in a way, but not enough to ever fight for her or stay celibate for her. At one point in the book Ever teases him for being such a whore in the past and he says that's because she was born too late and he needed to have his fun! She drops the conversation there- never says how could you sleep with all those women when you say you loved me back then? Nothing! I would have called him on that behavior- its ridiculous. Technically this is safety gang safe because he isn't with anyone in the book, but nothing about this relationship seemed safe to me. He was like an oversexed brat that always gets his way. He whined about the whole she left in his heart when she left, but I never really felt it. He seemed pretty happy with his casual lifestyle before she came back. He was never planning to go after her :( This book gave me a stomach ache.\n",

      "If you are a big fan of friends to lovers story like myself then this book is for you. Intercepted by Emma Hart is the third book in the By His Game series. I honestly couldn't wait to read Reid North's story and Ms. Hart did not disappoint her readers with this book. If you want romance, playfulness, heart, vulnerability and pure raw emotions then Intercepted is the book for you.\n",

      "Intercepted chronicles Everleigh White's return to California and her reunion with her childhood best friend and crush, Reid North. Throughout their childhood, Ever and Reid had this instant connection and bond. Feelings and strong emotions were felt between the two but never expressed to one another. So when Reid went off to college and Ever graduated high school, they never expressed and told each other how they felt. The big \"I love you\" was just hanging over their heads. Before Reid got the chance to tell Ever how he felt, Ever ran away and shut off any form of communication with Reid. She figured the distance was worth it because Reid has this new responsibility as a dad and his football career. Well fast forward to the present and Ever is back in town. The feelings that was lingering between Reid and Ever was still burning so bright and stronger than ever. So can the girl who is known for running away finally stay put and acknowledge that the man she loves is asking her to stay put and stop running? Can Ever finally run into the arms of her best friend? Or will their past and exes destroy and intercept their chance at happiness?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you ever read an Emma Hart book, you know that this author puts her heart into every story. The characters are so raw and vulnerable that ever emotion they expressed were seeping throughout the book You could feel how strong their strong emotional and physical connection for each other. Love didn't need to be said because it was felt. There was no denying that this couple finally found each other at the right moment and time in their lives. They may have wasted the years apart, but Ms. Hart showcases that they needed their past and ex-lovers to show them what they always knew. Ever and Reid belonged to one another. I absolutely love the conclusion of this series and it was a book that left a big smile on my face. Thank you Ms. Hart for another great book that will leave hearts to flutter for Reid North.\n",

      "This book is soooo silly. It's fiction, I'm aware of it, but c'mon, don't underestimate my intelligence. This h has stupid written in her forehead when she was 18 and 4 years later the word is still there. I'm not even annoyed I read it. I'm glad actually. I think the kidnapping, and car crashing landing one of the MCs in the hospital being in a induced coma for over 10 days is very overused. And I knew the ex boyfriend wasn't the stalker. That was too predictable. A lot. Like I said, don't underestimate my IQ.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Intercepted follows the story of Ever and Reid. Ever and Reid have been best friends for as long as they can remember. Over time, their feelings for one another progressed, but neither one of them acted on their feelings because of their age difference. One of Ever’s biggest regrets was leaving town without saying goodbye to Reid. Now, four years later, Ever is coming home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reid’s life hasn’t gone as planned. He should be out living the high life, enjoying being famous and young, but life had other plans for him. Tricked into parenthood by his ex, Reid is now a single father. He’s trying to do the best he can, but parenting isn’t easy. The last thing he expected was to run into Ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that they’ve been reunited, their attraction is even stronger. It feels as though no time has passed. But will feelings and misunderstandings cause them to miss out on what’s always been in front of them? What will happen when their ex’s won’t go away? Will Reid and Ever get the HEA that they’ve always dreamed of?\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoyed Intercepted. I love, love the friends to more story-line and this one really knocked it out of the park. I felt the connection between Reid and Ever immediately and was so sad that they lost out on so much time together. Their emotions and attraction were so palpable. I just couldn’t wait to read more. I did find myself frustrated at Ever sometimes, because she was just so stubborn, but Reid being a total alpha male, did an excellent job of pushing past her stubbornness and not letting her go.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I just adored Leo. Such a sweet, loving boy, but also a total smarty pants. I found myself laughing so many times when kept asking if Reid and Ever were giving each other cooties!! Kids have no filter sometimes! I love it. I would definitely be into seeing Leo get his own story down the road. Just putting that out there ;)\n",
      "\n",
      "Intercepted is a great friends to lovers/second chance romance. From the moment I read the first page, I knew this was a story I was going to get lost in. I fell for the characters instantly, even the side characters. Intercepted gave me everything I was looking for and more. I loved the angst, drama, romance, steam and suspense. The story also had some really great twists and turns. I was so intrigued with the story-line and was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next. This book can be read as a stand-alone, however I do recommend that you do read Blindsided and Sidetracked first.\n",

      "I liked all the characters and the hero and heroine were awesome! Not to mention Leo...that kid was so freaking funny..I absolutely loved him.

There is an ex (Leo's mom) but she's a crazy bitch and the hero doesn't want anything to do with her. I really loved this hero..he was an awesome dad and he was crazy I love with the heroine...sigh....\n",

I'm sure I'll glance at this from time to time when I want a fresh devotional and to be reminded of some of the things in her (excellent) actual book,Believing God, but I could also do the same with the book itself and also find what I'm looking for more easily than the devotional form. Still, it's not a bad resource, and as I got it as a free download on Kindle, I have no further complaints! :)\n",

      "I've heard lots of good things about Beth Moore so maybe this just wasn't a good first introduction to her. I was looking for a daily devotional but the thoughts in this one were just too short and shallow for me to really enjoy. Obviously I didn't need to read a whole year's worth to know this wasn't what I was looking for but I tried it for a full month. I'll try one of her books that is a real study rather than just daily thoughts before I really decide what I think of her as an author.\n",

      "As always, Beth is profound, witty, full of exortation and wisdom in her lovable, down-to-earth way. Her heart for the Lord is always obvious and she doesn't shy away from making you squirm a little while pep-talking you through your discomfort with such skill you almost enjoy the pain. This collection of devotionals on faith was great. The 2 paragraphs always left me wanting more. It's a devotional, so it accomplishes what it sets out to accomplish. I prefer her full Bible studies.\n",

      "The \"steampunk\" in the title is a little misleading, which is fine by me--I'm not super-interested in clockwork and steam engines for their own sake. Many of the stories aren't really even about ghosts, or at least they don't seem particularly \"ghosty\" to me. There are Satanic enclaves, mad inventors and their hideous machines, mummies, and time travel, all loosely bound together with phantasmagoric ties. The real throughline of the collection is the nineteenth century, that spooky, obsessive period of colonial expansion and industralization. The stories are all well-written, though some fall short of truly chilling effects. Standouts for me were Laird Barron's \"Blackwood's Baby,\" and Peter Beagle's \"Music, When Soft Voices Die.\" Garth Nix's \"The Curious Case of the Moondawn Daffodils Murder\" is a light, funny takeoff on Conan Doyle, and a break from the generally grim proceedings. A solid collection, with good representation from Australia and the UK--though of 17 stories, 14 are by men. (We do notice these things, folks.)\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Ghosts by Gaslight is the perfect example of what a short story collection ought to be. Though the stories are meant to convey a sense of dread (and indeed, many of them do - especially Lucius Shepard's dirty little tale), I found myself utterly delighted as I read each story. It has always seemed to me that ghost stories are best suited for briefness - else the author runs the risk of losing the tension. And yet, I am often frustrated by short stories that seem as though the author plucked them from some greater tale - endings are not quite endings, the characters and their motives seen unbeknownst to the poor reader. The varied authors of the tales in Ghosts by Gaslights have avoided this trap to the one.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's fairly common in multi-author collections to have pieces that are, well, filler. I didn't find a single piece of fill in this entire collection. Certainly, there are some stand-outs (Lucius Shepard, for one, as mentioned above), but each and every author seems to have brought their best to bear. I was especially impressed at how many managed the particular cadence of Victorian-era tales, without seeming to descend into parody.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would also note that the steampunk nature of the collection is profoundly understated. There's not a single dirigible to be had, and for these small things this particular reader is endlessly grateful.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Esta antología, editada por Jack Dann y Nick Gevers, contiene relatos ambientados a finales del XIX y principios del XX, siempre con elementos sobrenaturales, sobre todo fantasmas, y en alguna ocasión un toque steampunk. Me ha resultado una recopilación algo irregular, frase bastante tópica por otro lado cuando se habla de colecciones de cuentos, donde los hay de todas las calidades. Destacaría el de James Morrow, que precisamente comienza el libro.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I also, did not think there was much steampunk in these stories. A hint here and there, that was about it. Obviously some stories were better than others. But most on the bad side.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I found this book disappointing, not because of the quality of the writing, but because of the marketing. To call this anthology 'steampunk' is like calling a foot an ear. They don't look the same, work the same, or meet the same needs of their users.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steampunk elements are weak. In fact, they are as transparent as the haunts that appear in Ghosts by Gaslight. The publisher should have subtitled this tone \"Stories of Victorian Supernatural Suspense\". These stories are light on steampunk elements and heavy on Victorian ghost tales. Combing the two could have been fun, but sadly, this book failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I imagine some marketing person at Harper Voyager saying \"Hey, steampunk's hot right now, let's call these steampunk.\" It was a marketing ploy to sell a few extra copies (hey, it enticed me to buy one!), but it also risked alienating readers (like me!).\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not to say Ghost by Gaslight is a terrible book. The writing mimics the Victorian age (think Charles Dickens) to the point that some of the stories are difficult to read. What is missing is the steampunk technology, sense of adventure and alternate history (think Gail Carriger and Stephen Hunt) that brings other streampunk stories alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you like Victorian-style ghost stories, you might enjoy this anthology.\n",

We confuse our Ego for who we are, our roles for our purpose and the form for the real thing. We forget that we, the human beings, are 'Human' of course, but are also 'Beings'. The more we embrace our acquired identities, the more we give rise to dissatisfaction in our mid-life, an envelope of anxiety and unease that does not go away simply because we are 'successful'. It talks at length on man-woman relationship particularly in the context of marriage and of parenting.\n",

      "One of the better depth psychology written for the layperson I've read. I would recommend it to anyone thirty years and up. I wouldn't wait until \"middle age\" to start reading about maturation issues. This book addresses many of the issues I started experiencing (especially the anxiety, the emptiness, and the self-doubt) when I realized just how out of touch I was with issues of the self and soul. It explains the resentment I began to develop about my last job and why I felt the need to find more satisfying work (in a different city and environment). This book not only address maturation issues but it also discuss relationships and the need for two people in a marriage or relationship to follow their own paths of individuation (as opposed to complementing one another's weaknesses). This book also touches upon the subject of the shadow and the need for \"shadow work\" and how we might better interpret those negative emotions and feelings that crop up when our soul require tending. Highly recommend to those who are just as fascinated by their inner-selves and the chaos within as they are by the turbulent world about them...\n",

      "It should be noted that there are at least three things about the title of this book that are seriously mistaken, and those mistakes set the tone for the book as a whole. For one, the author was not blinded by the right, he was self-deceived by his own lack of sincerity and depth. For another, the author of this book does not show a great deal of conscience. To be sure, he states that he was remorseful for the hatchet job he did on Anita Hill by smearing her after her allegations of sexual harassment during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings in the Senate, but this book is the same sort of sex-obsessed rumor-mongering libelous hatchet job on the right that he used to conduct on the left. He hasn’t acquired a conscience; he merely has changed sides and dished out to his former associates what he used to dish out on their opponents on the left. On top of this, the statements of the author, and his continual contempt for traditionalists and social conservatives demonstrates that he was never a genuine conservative at all [1], but either a hypocritical neo-liberal or a libertarian with a strongly socially liberal bent. This book says all the right things about it being a mea culpa, a tell all of his former sleazy days, but it ends up being as sleazy as anything he ever did while a self-confessed right wing hit man. Instead, he is merely left-wing hit man now, which is moving down in the order of things, rather than improving.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of its contents, this book is a straightforward tale. It begins with a discussion on the author’s childhood, his discovery of his own homosexuality during his teenage years, his college experiences at Cal-Berkley that exposed him to the harsh left-wing radical political correctness that led him in his more libertarian bent to side with the right despite his hostility towards his paleo-Conservative father. Most of the book discusses the author’s double life as a neo-Conservative peddler of tabloid sleaze for various right-wing publishing houses and magazines on the one hand and as a hard-drinking but closeted gay man living in danger. Eventually, on the verge of being outed by the gay mafia, he comes out and is temporarily accepted by his conservative cohorts because of his writing against the Clinton administration, but when he writes what to him is a somewhat balanced and even-handed work on Hillary Clinton, his former associates turn on him, and he returns the favor, which this book is a part of. The end of the book attempts to provide a phony sense of starting over and rejecting the corrupt ways of the past, but the book as a whole is too full of dirty dishing on the sexual escapades of those who appear to be defenders of traditional morality to be anything more than a left-wing smear job of a particularly nasty kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, what was for me more interesting than reading the gossipy content of this book was trying to figure out why exactly the person who gave it to me, who is himself strongly leftist in his own political worldview but also a respected leader within our own congregation, found so praiseworthy about this book. Certainly, the moral life of the author, in his drunkenness and debauchery and moral dissipation, was no figure worthy of praise. It appeared to me that the person who loaned the book to me seemed to enjoy it merely because of the way it painted conservatives as hypocritical, dangerous to America’s freedom, and uninterested in the truth if it contradicts with a supposed right wing conspiracy, all while seeking to continue the false pretense that nothing similar to this problem exists on the left. Instead of presenting a genuinely worthwhile position, something worth modeling in public discourse or our own private lives, this book seeks to present a tired false dilemma, where the author was on both sides but never came to any sort of worthwhile position that truly comes to terms with the darkness and evil within his own heart, or the full extent of corruption within our body politic, of which this author is a prime example in so many ways.\n",

      "This book is the Rosencranz and Guildenstern are Dead of 1980s and 1990s Washington D.C. It's a story of U.S. politics during the George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations told from the view of a man who wrote influential Anita Hill takedowns and the article that launched Troopergate, in addition to a lot of other, similar material.\n",
      "\n",
      "This man is David Brock, an adopted, gay U.C. Berkeley grad who admired RFK as a young adult but became turned off by what he perceived as censorial self-righteousness of liberal on-campus activists in college.\n",
      "\n",
      "He moved to D.C. and joined the staff of the conservative after graduation, and then later joined , during which time, as he describes in this engaging, sobering, and clarifying memoir, he worked with a number of conservative lobbyists, lawyers, millionaires and billionaires, political operatives, politicians, and private investigators to publish apocryphal stories that would help get Clarence Thomas (the 5th vote in Bush v. Gore and Shelby County v. Holder) confirmed by a Democratic congress and harm Bill Clinton's presidential legacy and Hillary Clinton's political career and policy agenda. He had an insider's view of the Arkansas Project.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started reading this book during perhaps the most heated moment of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, when the Access Hollywood tape came out and Bill Clinton's sex scandals became relevant again. I finished it today. It seems even more important to bear witness in the shadow of an outcome so few of us expected. Many of the pro-Thomas, anti-Clinton individuals that Brock meets, works, and socializes with come across as extraordinarily craven, hypocritical, morally and ethically absent, downright looney (but also, in Brock's telling, pitiable).\n",

      "I was a college classmate of Ken Starr's daughter and met him and stayed in his house when our a capella group toured the East Coast. They both seemed like decent people driven by a faith they believe in, and I wouldn't count him in the above group, although Brock's critiques of Starr's opportunistic embrace of prurience and willful mixing of politics and justice are fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brock began to have second thoughts about his work and associations, as any sane person would.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the strength of sales of his first book, , Brock received a $1 million advance in 1995 from Simon & Schuster's Free Press to write a hit job on Hillary Clinton. He writes:\n",

      "\n",
      "Booted out of a movement he had come to despise, Brock rebuilt his personal and professional life from scratch, wrote a private letter of apology to Anita Hill, and a public one to Bill Clinton. He slowly gained the trust of real journalists, Clinton loyalists, and then the Clintons themselves. He switched sides and worked for Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign and headed three pro-Hillary organizations, including Priorities USA, in 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this book was published in 2002, before any of the remarkable events of the past eight years. Here is what Brock writes about the relationship between the kind of politics he practiced in the 1980s and 1990s and voting:\n",
      "\n",
      "After reading this book, which I recommend, one takeaway is clear. It is an argument that Brock makes explicitly as well, in some cases based on visceral, first-hand information of individuals like Laura Ingraham. Hillary Clinton is not, as many of her detractors and disappointed supporters argue, charismaless. She has a rare anti-charisma, in that self-doubting individuals who come into contact with her project onto her things they hate about themselves. She connects with voters, but too often, tragically, she connects with their darkest fears and insecurities instead of their hopes and dignity. They see their imperfections in her, they hate her for it, and past the point of reason in the case of 6.7 million voters and counting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glenn Greenwald, Susan Sarandon, and others on the pacifist left see in Hillary Clinton their own compromised relationship with American military power. They vote and protest against Middle East intervention, but then live and live well under the protection of drone strikes and mass surveillance. They hate themselves for it, and Iraq War-voting, Libya intervention-supporting Hillary makes for a ripe home for that hate.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some hacked emails, Colin Powell accused Hillary Clinton of \"hubris\" and being \"greedy.\" Powell's work on behalf of the Iraq War is the very definition of hubris. never uses the word greed in this 2001 article:\n",

      "Blinded by the Right and perhaps a great darkness in ourselves, Hillary became America's bête noire, and now we will soon have a leader whom zero of our living presidents voted for. Whatever the future holds, a lesson and next step might lie in the place where Brock's story turned years ago:\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Granted, this book is a decade old, but Brock's book is a veritable \"Who's Who\" of the Republican right and an expose of the right-wing disinformation machine the Republicans built in the 90s. There are so many reviews of the book, I hesitated to write one. But here are some points many of the other reviews leave out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brock clearly shows that the worst thing that ever happened to the GOP was the collapse of communism. Without the communists to hate and deride, Republicans were left in a vacuum. Their party had no real platform beyond communism's destruction other than the unspoken platform of maintaining the status quo of the military industrial complex. So when the Soviet Union collapsed, the Republicans looked for new enemies domestically: professional women, gays and the politically correct elitist media culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether he realizes it or not, Brock does an exceptional job of showing the underlying premise as to why the extreme wing of the GOP hates professional women and gays so much: both threaten the dominate male culture. Hence, professional women are characterized as \"bull-dog dykes\" and gay men as \"ineffectual fags.\" Neither stands up to what a real man should be like nor what a real woman should be like. Brock's repetition of how professional women and gays are characterized clearly shows how the same euphemisms are used over and over.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing this book does is provide a list of names of everyone involved in the Republican hegemony. It is ironic that one of these individuals likes to keep a picture of Lenin as a sort of role model, because Brock's portrayal of the GOP shows it to be even more ideologically entrenched than the communist party ever was, and just as, if not more so, vicious in its internal purges of anyone who doesn't tow the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, you'll wonder what ever happened to true conservatism. Does conservatism really have a place in today's political discussion? Or is it as atavistic, inbred and hateful as Brock describes it to be? Rather than being the shoulders of the past that today's leaders could use to stand upon to peer into the future, as described by the late conservative writer Russell Kirk, conservatism appears to have regressed into an infantile chorus of whining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Brock puts himself right in the middle of all this, unflinchingly showing how egotistic, power and status hungry he was along the way. He does make some attempt to explain why he behaved so shallowly, but it is much too early for Brock to really be able to objectively evaluate his own pitfalls. In the years to come, however, I'm sure he will complete his personal evaluation, and it wouldn't surprise me if he revisits this topic later in his life with the new perspective of time and distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all, this book is a must read for anyone who remotely considers themselves a follower of American politics.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Eh. Brock's still more or less a self-flagellating opportunist. It's worth reading if you enjoy (as I do) getting the dirt on some of the shadier characters in the right wing. I loved hearing that Grover Norquist has a giant portrait of Lenin (!) in his living room, and that Newt Gingrich is pretty much as awful as you would imagine he is, and reading of Laura Ingraham crawling around on all fours, drunk, at a gay club while whacked out of her mind on cat tranquilizers just brings a small glimmering tear of joy to my eye.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I'm a few years late reading this book; I think at the time, I was a little disgruntled with the single-minded university politics around me and reviews that contained words and phrases like \"tell-all!\" \"sensational!\" and \"insider's view on the right-wing conspiracy!\" led me to believe that it was a politically motivated, sensationalist account.\n",
      "I was so wrong. I think that I've had a hard time connecting to politics because coming of age as a political being in the time of Bush is just so surreal most of the time, you look around and all you can think is, \"How did we get here?\"\n",
      "This book is important to read if you want to answer that question. It's thoughtful, scrupulously honest, and insightful.\n",
      "It was interesting to go back into the details of events that happened when I was too young to really be aware of them, remembering the events that first made me aware of politics in this country. And, in the ugly face of those scandal-based politics, I think it's much easier to understand why our generation is so apathetic. For me, that's the first step to dropping back in and really taking a look at putting our mark on this country. As far as I'm concerned, a book that makes me want to get involved is a good thing=)\n",

Instead, she has a run in with a sexy American military man on a secret mission, which leads the Catalan Liberation Front terrorist organization to think she's his CIA contact and kidnap her. This leads to a chase all over Spain with Karen, the terrorists, and her hot Navy SEAL Romeo (and his two equally hot teammates).\n",

      "What’s a girl to do when all six vampire bosses want her to bond with them? There’s good reason to bond because a cruel masochistic vampire named Valentine wants Piper for his very own. Bonding with one of her bosses sounds so much better than what Valentine has in store for her. But which one? A surprise visit from her parents causes Piper to panic but she should’ve known better. Her vampires plan human rather well and stick up for her when her parents attack her. Suddenly, the vampires and Piper are summoned to visit the vampires’ sire. Time has run out for Piper and she must be bonded or else Valentine will surely take her captive and work his will on her in the most painful way possible. Who will Piper choose?\n",

      "SO glad I kept reading these books! This series is perfect for someone looking for a different twist to paranormal romance. These complicated relationships will keep you up reading through the night. The main character Piper finds herself employed as the maid for SIX 🤤GORGEOUS vampires but she also has a dangerous admirer. While reading you’ll start to wonder if Piper will developed true feelings for one or all of her employers? Throw in some funny mishaps and you got yourself a great new series to keep you entertained. Again I gave the book 4stars because of typos and the parent scene felt like something was missing. I thought a twist should’ve been added to that part of the story. Impatiently waiting for book3!\n",

He as orchestrated it so that Piper has to go to their sire also, so to keep her safe she has to bond with one of the men. But with six men she’s attracted to whom will she choose?

      "==============\n",
      "Crazy, intense story. I thought it would be just a normal mail order bride story of coming to the west, finding the husband she wrote to, and boom—romance blossoms. But no, there is some nasty business going on in the town of Come-by-Chance, Montana. When Emily escapes Chicago after witnessing a murder, she thinks nothing worse can happen. She is sooooo wrong. I won’t be a spoil-sport, but just know, nothing is as it seems…and keeping secrets is never a good option. But to an innocent girl fresh off the train with no one else in the world to love or watch out for her, secrets bind her. There is a romance in this, but it comes after wading through a lot of muck. Poor Emily triumphs in the end, but there are other side characters I’m dying to know about now whose lives didn’t tie up into happy bows at the end of this one.\n",

      "The only reason I even gave this book 2 stars was because it had a good plot. I found this book in the religious section but I could count the numbers of times on 1 hand how many times it even made a REFERENCE to God. And that's all it did -- make references. No more than 2-3 might I add. I felt that if it was a 'Christian' book there should certainly be no swearing, but, there were 2 swear words in this book. I wasn't very pleased with the 2 slang words in the book either, but I know devoted Christians who use slang words so that didn't bother me AS much. But it still bothered me\n",

      "When the heroine secluded herself to spell her illegal gray magic she was approached by an evil wizard and after she attempted to banish him to the underworld where he belongs, it's she herself that is imprisoned in the otherworld. Surrounded by Fae and a general sense of peace, she is still frantic to escape but her magic just doesn't seem to be working. In joking manner she cast a spell to bring her a gorgeous man if she can't get freedom, never imagining that that particular spell would work just fine. The hero is man of responsibility, honor and duty. He is kind and softhearted despite his intimidating size and the fact that he is royalty along the Fae. When he promised to a young woman he doesn't love, it never crosses his mind to disappoint his parents. When he finds out his betrothal is not only in love with a common man but pregnant as well, the hero still resigns himself to marrying the girl if he can't find a suitable solution for all parties involved. He never imagined he could come to care for a stubborn and wayward witch but from the time he first saw the heroine's photograph, he felt s connection to her. The heroine is missing though, for over a year, and her family is frantic to get her back, especially when her sister envisions a dark and deadly future. The hero never imagined that he'd suddenly find himself drawn forth by a powerful spell and into the prison that is holding the heroine herself. Furious with this turn of events and desperate to return to the fight that is waging between the Fae, the witches and the demon horde, he neither the less finds himself drawn to the beautiful heroine. Their relations could be called lust but somehow they both know that what lies between them is so much more. But when the heroine finds out he is betrothed, she turns him away from her bed. It doesn't last long before she is succumbing to the desire that builds between them and in the end, it's that powerful magic generated from their lovemaking that is key to the heroine breaking them free of their cage. Reunited with her family for only a brief moment before her sister is kidnapped, the heroine now must brave her nightmares turned reality and venture back into the depth of hell she's feared for so long. With visions of death and sacrifice, the heroine must find all her courage to do what she must to save her sister. But she has the hero, the man who turns his back on his family duty to love her, at her side.\n",

      "***Sigh*** Once again, I find myself hesitate to say I liked this book. On one hand, there were times I was engaged in the story and the hero and heroine were both characters I came to admired and like. On the other, there was that damn disconnect between me and the 5 stars. Something about this book didn't jive with me. Perhaps it lacked an easy flow. Perhaps there was not as much excitement as I would have liked- not considering that end battle which was nails. Whatever the reason, I couldn't get swept away in the pages and looking back, I can't say I had enjoyed the over all novel. I liked the heroine, I will say that. She was stubborn but she was capable and she brave enough to risk everything, her frightening visions, her loss of magic and the very real possibility she will be responsible for the end of the world, for the life of her sister. Their bond was true and very strong. The hero was a very admirable character as well. Once bound by duty, he never imagined he'd fall in love with a witch. But when he did, he surrendered his title, gave his wealth away and surrendered to life with the woman he loves which I found incredibly sweet. The book wasn't bad....it just wasn't anything special either. I remember the others books I've read in this series to have a similar lackluster performance and have doubts this author is capable of writing a true gem.\n",

Eventually she manages to suck someone else in with her, and wouldn't you know, it's the hottie Fae warrior of her dreams that happens to know all about her because he's been battling the warlock in San Fran. It takes them a while to get out of the entrapment, and in the meantime, she learns the wonders of sex magic. Meanwhile, the warlock is getting it on with a female demon who's possessed a hot woman's body, and also with a dark witch, all the while secretly in love with the other sister witch (Silver). On another plotline, Silver falls in love with a different Fae warrior. And there's also an underground elf king who has the hots for Copper, as well as an arranged marriage that is thwarted by an affair. Eventually, there's a happily ever after ending.\n",

      "If you read Immaculée’s riveting autobiographical account of her survival of the Rwandan genocide, Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust, and wondered if her troubles were over, think again. They had only just begun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Led by Faith is her painful personal account of life after the massacre of over a million Tutsi during the span of three months in 1994. Officially the killing spree was over, but the suffering, dying, hatred and bigotry went on. As did the unending need for forgiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, thanks to her Amazing Faith—substitute the word “Faith” for “Love” in the familiar song and you have Immaculée—in her Awesome God, and her beautiful prayers, she overcame daunting obstacles, and withstood threats from friends and foes alike, which eventually led her to a new life in America.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t want to spoil the entire book so I won’t say more, except, if you ever need a pick-me-up, read it. Yes, despite everything, this is an amazingly affirming book. It is like a mini-lesson in Prayer. Her prayers were a guide and inspiration for me. We must truly believe He hears our every prayer and wants more than we do to answer us if our faith is firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best of all, Immaculée is guest speaker at our Catholic Women’s Conference in 2018, so I will finally get to meet her!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==================================\n",
      "\n",
      "Sept 15, 2008: Saw the author interviewed by Raymond Arroyo on EWTN tonight. Her survival story during the Rwandan genocide of 1994 is riveting. Although I can't read this anytime soon, I do want to read it!\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I read Left To Tell the month before moving to Rwanda. It was remarkable to see the incredible faith of someone who had lived such tragedy, but a little difficult to imagine the reality. Reading Led By Faith was a different experience altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "I currently live across the street from Pastor Murinzi's house where Immaculee hid for three months. When she speaks of killers in the street, it is almost impossible to really believe that she is literally talking about the dirt road in front of my house. Hearing the names of the places I go on runs, or where I like to my spend days off...it really hits a different chord with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realize how grateful I am to be here and to witness a Rwanda so unlike the one she suffered in. It is the most beautiful country in the world, full of people who greet you in the street and watch out for you like family. Immaculee speaks the truth when she writes about the Rwanda now--this country built from the ashes of genocide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forgiveness plays a role in all 11 billion people living in this tiny country. Even if they didn't witness the genocide, they live it out in different ways. If I didn't know the tragedy, that most of my village and the surrounding villages were wiped out completely in 1994, I would never imagine there had ever been a war or even a disagreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "People carry themselves with love and friendship...and I think this is the message Immaculee wishes to give the world. Although the Rwandan people are truly a Godly people, they are still human. If they can overcome a massacre of such proportions and live on to tell their stories and love their enemies...who are we to say that we have been hurt too greatly? Who are we to withhold forgiveness?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am inspired daily by this country and the beautiful people who live here...and I am thankful Immaculee has shared her story with the world, so they can see Rwanda as something more, much more, than a genocide.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Immaculee is an amazing person with a gift for prayer and a faith that, almost literally, moves mountains. While this follow-up book answers a few questions, I found in disappointing. I think that Immaculee’s point in writing this book isn’t autobiographical. She wants to inspire readers to forgive, pray and trust God. As a Christian, I am inspired by her faith, but after reading Left to Tell, I wanted more of Immaculee. Immaculee is a wonderful storyteller when she is writing about prayer, miracles and her faith, but she doesn’t let us truly get to know her. She writes very little about her relationship with her husband, her children or her friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the fact that I wanted more, I would recommend this book, because Immaculee continues to show us how to trust God in everything. Her life is an inspiring example of faith and courage.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I read this book in less than 24 hours as the stories were so compelling that it was hard to put down. If anyone reads Immaculee's books without feeling her unabashed joy and tenacity for seeking God, their hearts are hardened. I cannot begin to think of the things that Rwandans went through in the mid-1990's, nor can I pretend my troubles are near that horrendous level. Immaculee's experiences and deep-seated need for forgiveness and repentance show me that it should be first and foremost my duty to seek the same and serve others as much and as well as I serve myself. If Ms. Ilibagiza can find pure joy in a life that has seen so much sorrow, we have no excuse to set about doing the same in our lives of privilege. Bigger and better things cannot make happiness, but happiness is found in a bigger and better God than our minds can fathom. Thank you, Immaculee (and Steve Erwin) for telling your story. God has indeed used your words wonderfully.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is an inspiring testimony of using a life scarred by a genocide for good. While this book focuses on the author's experience after the Rwandan Genocide, it does a good job explaining the context throughout the book. One definitely does not need to know much of the history beforehand in order to follow along. Like the title suggests, it is primarily a personal account of the author's personal faith journey. It is a beautiful and genuine account, but readers should know that the testimony is more emotional than educational. I recommend this book for those wanting to gain a better understanding of the effects of the Rwandan Genocide on the individual level. It rounded out my prior knowledge a bit, and it was certainly inspiring for my own faith.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'll be honest, I hated and I mean HATED Elle in the first book. She's rude and cold and she certainly doesn't mince words or make friends. She's an ice queen in every way and there's only two sides to her; the professional and the woman you don't want to be on the wrong side of. I wasn't sure I'd ever like her, but Roni Loren proved me wrong in just one chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "By The Hour gives the reader a whole different side of Elle; the side that tells you why she is the way she is and you can't help but feel for her. Whether it's sympathy or pity, you understand her and the depth of her hurt. This is a woman that suffered the worst sort of betrayal from someone who was supposed to love her and she never recovered for it. She lashes out before anyone gets close. She's closed off and rude. She's the one everyone avoids at a party...except for Lane Cannon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lane is a man who has his own demons from the past. A previous escort, he's working hard towards his dream career. He's damn good at what he does now, even if the snobbish doctor never ceases to remind him how little she thinks of his lowly sex surrogate ways. But one vulnerable moment leads to some sizzling hate sex and things are irreversibly changed between them forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There's quite a bit of back and forth that goes on between Elle and Lane. Elle struggles with letting her walls down and in her hard shell of self preservation, hurts Lane on more than one occasion. As much as I wanted to rage at her or judge her, it's tough, knowing her history. This is a woman that has every reason to lose her faith in men and love, so she struggles deeply with accepting Lane's affection.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What I really appreciated about her is she was never simpering or whiny about it. She's tough as nails and she certainly gives as good as she gets. She's mouthy but she's also funny and has a soft side to her that she hides beneath her hard layers.\n",

      "I loved the chemistry between her and Lane. Their hate lust was entertaining....\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But what really sold me was watching the development of their relationship. It's a slow build and they each have their own insecurities that they battle, but they also help balance each other out. I loved how understanding Lane was with Elle and I loved watching Elle's fierce protectiveness and caring heart come out more and more when it comes to Lane.\n",

I was definitely hooked after reading the first installment but just blew my mind. I love Roni’s writing, I loved the enemies to lovers theme of the story, I loved these characters and this smoking hot couple. I loved getting more than I expected because Elle and Lane are surely more than you would expect after reading that “hate to love” blurb. Gah, I am in love!\n",
      "\n",
      "So, is the second novel in the series and, if you have read the first book, you know where it is focused: a sex therapy center. Well, imagine a therapist known as The Ice Queen falling in lust (and love!) with the sex surrogate in the building. You would imagine there is no way for them to become more than a hate fuck, right? Well, you are very wrong because Elle and Lane hide many layers of secrets from each other and as time advances and they start really knowing each other, it’s impossible for those sparks not to turn into love!\n",

      "Roni Loren surely knows how to write one hell of an explosive love story! I really enjoyed , the first book in this series, but has totally bewitched me. This author’s writing is absolutely fantastic, the story developed fluently and I loved seeing these two apparently opposite characters unable to fight against their chemistry. It all starts with a mind-blowing hate fuck but that connection after is impossible to stop! As the story progresses and this couple starts showing their true selves to each other, you’ll melt all over the place. Not only because their oh-so-HAWT sex scenes but also because of the emotions that start growing between Lane and Elle.\n",

      "I love erotic romance. I consider it, together with contemporary romance, my absolute favorite genre. And Roni Loren delivered a fantastic piece of erotica with this novel. As I said, not only the sexual tension and the actual sex are off-the-charts but also because Roni built an outstanding relationship between this couple. It’s beautiful to see them opening their hearts, finally leaving all the obstacles aside and starting an amazing relationship. I loved these two together and I wish we could have more because I don’t want to say goodbye to them. Still it’s easier to do it because I am so happy they are living their much deserved happily ever after!\n",

Lane and Elle are such a wonderful couple and I am sure you’ll love reading their explosive and emotional love story. Believe me, all the emotions are completely worth it. You’ll melt with these two and their beautiful connection! I do hope to read more books by Roni Loren because this series worked 100% for me. Highly recommend reading this one!\n",

I really have fish memory so I totally forgot the main characters for this book. A bit recap from previous book, Off the Clock, is about Marin and Donovan who works at a elite health or mental institute called The Grove. It's not an asylum - more like private healing place for troubled rich people. Donovan has a before Marin and this is her story.\n",

      "If I'm not wrong, I kinda hated Elle in the previous book. Totally bitch mode. But I was surprised with the real Elle behind her poker face. Of course, she's a brilliant and successful doctor but her personal life such a disaster. Elle act all tough and impenetrable in her armor but the truth is she's longing for someone real. But her mind is too focused on her ex's lies and betrayal.\n",

Even she's not a submissive, but I enjoyed her struggle with Lane. Everything he did to her made me fanned myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was so much back and forth between Elle and Lane. Mostly because of her deep-rooted problem. I liked how their relationship turns from minus to something. Elle realize what she has done and wanna try with Lane. She wants to believe him so badly. Anyway, Elle has family drama and Lane didn't abandon her. He help her through with it. He's totally a keeper!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, beside their sexy times, I adored this couple with their own problems. No one is perfect. The story was nicely written with steady paced that I couldn't put it down.

      "Maybe I'm being too harsh but this series is just not working for me. The heroine continues to piss me off non stop and is consistently controlled by her hormones. Not only that she's annoying in forgiving and then hating on her men, it's such a back and forth I have whiplash. If there were ever a girl who should make her men work for it, its her. She also continues to let herself be manipulated and controlled by those around her when really I wonder why she doesn't just burn the world to the ground. I was a bit shocked by a revelation/secret from one of her men, I was expecting him to be the stable and sedate one yet he's causing more of an uproar than even the brooding grump of a twin. Also I really could have done without the whole beautiful teacher coming in & latching onto one of her men creating some messed up fake relationship where everybody is playing everyone and out for themselves. On the cliche front we have the evil nemesis turning into a friend and I just could care less. I'll continue on mostly because I am curious about the headmistress's grand plan and how the heroine plays into that. I also want to learn more about her vampire, he's been hidden underground for hundreds of years for a reason and honestly he is the only daring thing I felt the heroine has done thus far.\n",

      "When the heroine secluded herself to spell her illegal gray magic she was approached by an evil wizard and after she attempted to banish him to the underworld where he belongs, it's she herself that is imprisoned in the otherworld. Surrounded by Fae and a general sense of peace, she is still frantic to escape but her magic just doesn't seem to be working. In joking manner she cast a spell to bring her a gorgeous man if she can't get freedom, never imagining that that particular spell would work just fine. The hero is man of responsibility, honor and duty. He is kind and softhearted despite his intimidating size and the fact that he is royalty along the Fae. When he promised to a young woman he doesn't love, it never crosses his mind to disappoint his parents. When he finds out his betrothal is not only in love with a common man but pregnant as well, the hero still resigns himself to marrying the girl if he can't find a suitable solution for all parties involved. He never imagined he could come to care for a stubborn and wayward witch but from the time he first saw the heroine's photograph, he felt s connection to her. The heroine is missing though, for over a year, and her family is frantic to get her back, especially when her sister envisions a dark and deadly future. The hero never imagined that he'd suddenly find himself drawn forth by a powerful spell and into the prison that is holding the heroine herself. Furious with this turn of events and desperate to return to the fight that is waging between the Fae, the witches and the demon horde, he neither the less finds himself drawn to the beautiful heroine. Their relations could be called lust but somehow they both know that what lies between them is so much more. But when the heroine finds out he is betrothed, she turns him away from her bed. It doesn't last long before she is succumbing to the desire that builds between them and in the end, it's that powerful magic generated from their lovemaking that is key to the heroine breaking them free of their cage. Reunited with her family for only a brief moment before her sister is kidnapped, the heroine now must brave her nightmares turned reality and venture back into the depth of hell she's feared for so long. With visions of death and sacrifice, the heroine must find all her courage to do what she must to save her sister. But she has the hero, the man who turns his back on his family duty to love her, at her side.\n",

      "***Sigh*** Once again, I find myself hesitate to say I liked this book. On one hand, there were times I was engaged in the story and the hero and heroine were both characters I came to admired and like. On the other, there was that damn disconnect between me and the 5 stars. Something about this book didn't jive with me. Perhaps it lacked an easy flow. Perhaps there was not as much excitement as I would have liked- not considering that end battle which was nails. Whatever the reason, I couldn't get swept away in the pages and looking back, I can't say I had enjoyed the over all novel. I liked the heroine, I will say that. She was stubborn but she was capable and she brave enough to risk everything, her frightening visions, her loss of magic and the very real possibility she will be responsible for the end of the world, for the life of her sister. Their bond was true and very strong. The hero was a very admirable character as well. Once bound by duty, he never imagined he'd fall in love with a witch. But when he did, he surrendered his title, gave his wealth away and surrendered to life with the woman he loves which I found incredibly sweet. The book wasn't bad....it just wasn't anything special either. I remember the others books I've read in this series to have a similar lackluster performance and have doubts this author is capable of writing a true gem.\n",

There's a band of good-guy Fae warriors on the witches' side, battling it out in San Francisco with the warlock's minons. The witches, of course, are powerful and determined to stop him.\n",

Other creatures are trapped with her for the 15 months she's stuck there. Eventually she manages to suck someone else in with her, and wouldn't you know, it's the hottie Fae warrior of her dreams that happens to know all about her because he's been battling the warlock in San Fran. It takes them a while to get out of the entrapment, and in the meantime, she learns the wonders of sex magic. Meanwhile, the warlock is getting it on with a female demon who's possessed a hot woman's body, and also with a dark witch, all the while secretly in love with the other sister witch (Silver). On another plotline, Silver falls in love with a different Fae warrior. And there's also an underground elf king who has the hots for Copper, as well as an arranged marriage that is thwarted by an affair. Eventually, there's a happily ever after ending.\n",

Maybe if more time where spent on character development and less on explaining the complicated 'verse and the many interconnecting relationships, I could have developed emotional ties to the characters.

      "I have so much admiration and respect for Katherine and Jay. This book wasn’t my favorite on the topic, but it did have some significant takeaways and perspectives that I haven’t gotten from other books on suffering. I wish they had cut out some of the fluff and landed the plane a bit more on where their beliefs are found in scripture, but I am glad I read it when I did. Their optimism and positivity about their suffering is pretty remarkable and made me pause and think a lot about how I view the days of suffering ahead.\n",

      "The Wolfs have done it again. After they shared their story in Hope Heals, they wrote another fantastic resource for people who encounter suffering. That’s everybody! We all need hope. The Lord Jesus Christ is our Creator, Savior, and Sustainer. His Word to us—the Bible—redefines how we see our difficulties. Learn from the lessons in Suffer Strong. What an encouragement! A challenge to look up to the Author and Perfecter of our faith—and find eternal hope, overflowing joy, and true healing and peace.\n",

      "After Katherine's devastating stroke, she could have wallowed in self-pity and she did for a little while. However, she found a way to reframe and redefine the way she suffered. Her book is all about attitude shifting and finding blessing in life's worst.\n",

      "\n",
      "Jay and Katherine write this lovely book together. They trade off every other chapter and write from their hearts the lessons they learned since Katherine's stroke. Their book disrupts the myth that joy can only be found in a pain-free life.\n",

      "Healing from a chronic illness I have seen dark days...days of hopelessness...days of pain and dread...days of wanting to be who I was before I got sick and sometimes missing the things that were right in front of me because my body demanded so much attention. Not only did the sickness beat me up, but my own thoughts of trying to be my old self got the best of me many days. As I continue to heal and as symptoms subside I can look out now and see the world in front of me. It's quite beautiful and the truth is the glue that held me together was my faith....Jesus...the very thing that hold Jay and Katherine together. The chapters redefine limitations, beauty (my favorite chapter), community, calling, hope and so much more. This book is a great tool for any life change. May it bring comfort, encouragement and hope. Jay and Katherine...thank you for championing this message. Your strength and courage shine bright!\n",

      "I was interested in this book because as a Catholic I understand that suffering, even deeply profound and lasting suffering, can be a part of life. And that that suffering can be used for a purpose. And that such suffering does not necessarily mean that the suffering life is not worth living. So I was interested to read a take on suffering from the evangelical community. It was very worth the read. I especially liked Mrs. Wolf's take on her life as being worth living not in spite of her disability, but BECAUSE of her disability. And I liked that while she approaches herself with humor, she does not sugar-coat her difficulties.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I would have liked this better had I read her first book prior to reading this one. But I very MUCH appreciated that she and her husband were the narrators of the audiobook, giving you a chance to hear her as you would if you were at one of her events.\n",

      "Don't let the somewhat corny title of this book put you off. This book is a wonderful and very simple introduction to real healthy eating for anyone currently eating a average-quality diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great things about this book:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. For those that just want the facts super-fast this book gives you a one page summary of the eating plan within the first 6 pages of the book. The book also contains lots of extra information backing up their conclusions as well, for those that want it.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. This book is about eating healthily and how to improve your health and reduce your risk of getting ill in the future with diet - rather than just about mere weight loss - which is so refreshing. Slow weight normalisation is a side effect of following this diet for sure, but it is not the primary focus.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The research for the book began when the authors were each working to improve their own health issues through diet. The authors are genuinely nice people that are passionate about helping others get the same results they have and the subject of a healthy diet and this comes through clearly on every page of this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The diet the authors recommend is made up of 20% carbs, 65% fat and 15% protein. So it is a low/moderate carb, high fat and moderate protein diet by calories, and 35% animal foods and 65% plant foods by weight. This is very similar to a traditional Pacific Islander diet, the authors explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sections explaining the facts of fats, carbs and protein are of a very high quality and seem to summarise the work of all the best books I have read on nutrition and diet lately. The problems with a high carb diet are clearly spelled out as are the benefits of a high fat diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The book also recommends avoiding all grains (other than rice), legumes, dry lean meats, vegetable oils and pasteurised dairy products and recommends eating unlimited non-starchy vegetables (750 grams a day or more or 1.5 pounds), 200 - 450 grams or so (0.5 to 1 pound) of fatty meat/seafood/eggs, about 4 teaspoons of healthy fats (ghee, lard and coconut oil and a bit of olive oil), and snacking on nuts, cheese and fruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors warn that while fibre can be helpful, for some people too much fibre can be a real problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Where this book differs from many others in the same (reduced-carb and traditional foods) vein is that it explains that, yes, while your body can make the glucose it needs from protein when you eat a low carb diet, this process taxes the body unnecessarily and the conversion may be inefficient. This is especially true for those that are ill, the authors explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite my making a bit of a hobby of reading a large amount of very good books on healthy eating and diet in recent years, no other book had made these same points. So having this explained so well finally was wonderful and it explained a lot!\n",
      "\n",
      "(I did really well on a 20 grams of carbohydrate a day diet for 6 - 9 months or so. I felt well and had no more hypoglycemia and lost a lot of weight. But after that 6 months was up my body seemed to really struggle with it, perhaps due to the fact I have severe metabolic, endocrine, and cardiac problems. (I'm housebound and 95% bedbound and very disabled.) When I finally went back up to 50 - 75 grams of carbs a day (years later) I felt so much better, and finally was able to start losing some of the weight that had crept back on on my super-low carb regime. It was also a much more pleasant way to eat; being able to have 5 cups of veggies a day and a bit of fruit! I feel like staying on this super-low carb diet for so long delayed my health from beginning to improve as well, as it made my body work harder than it had to on food assimilation which of course leaves less metabolic energy and bodily resources left over for the work of healing.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The book explains that eating very low carb and making your body convert proteins to carbs puts strain on the liver and uses up bodily resources, generates ammonia as a toxic by-product, puts a person at risk of glucose deprivation if the are ill or lacking in certain nutrients and makes nutrient deficiencies more likely due to lower fruit and vegetable intake. Very low carbohydrate intake can also cause problems with vitamin C utilisation that may even lead to scurvy, as vitamin C is stimulated by insulin. For these reasons they recommend eating an amount of carbs daily which is very close to how much the body actually needs; 200 - 400 carb calories daily (or roughly 50 - 100 grams of carbs daily).\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with the authors that healthy people will likely have few problems converting one macronutrients to another (such as protein to carbs, and carbs to fat) but for those of us that are ill it is best to save your body the work and to eat foods in the appropriate macro-nutrient percentages to start with. That just seems to make so much sense!\n",
      "\n",
      "Things about the book I am not sure about, to some entent:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. I'm not convinced that all of us can handle the foods the authors describe as \"safe starches\" and in those amounts. For me eating rice with meals gives me so much carbohydrate it leaves me feeling spacey, hungry and unsatisfied. I am also unconvinced that eating rice is better for you than eating the same amount of carbs in vegetable form, as the authors even say themselves in the book that rice is low in nutrients compared to other foods, calorie for calorie. There is no real nutrition in it, and so for me no reason to eat it - and lots of reasons not to.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found it even more surprising that not only did the authors recommend eating rice often, but they even extended this to processed foods like rice crackers and rice noodles. Foods many of us with an interest in healthy eating and nutrient-dense eating just wouldn't want to eat at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend trying the authors' \"safe starches\" idea and seeing if it works for you, but being aware that for some of us these foods may be best avoided or minimised and eating LOTS of non-starchy veggies and 2-3 serves of fruit may work better for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Like many others I also cannot tolerate any of the dairy products the author recommends and also have egg allergy issues. I feel these issues could have been discussed a bit more in the book, as they are so so common. I also think fermented foods and drinks could have been emphasised more and disagree with the authors' assertions that nuts and seeds need only be soeaked if you eat a lot of them. For those of us with lots of gut and digestion problems, soaking all nuts and seeds can make a wonderful difference that is really noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "(I wish so much I had learned about the importance of soaking nuts and eating fermented foods sooner!)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. While this book provides a great summary of many of many of the best books on nutrition, the same cannot be said of the information given on supplements. This information was very patchy, incomplete and just plain wrong in many instances and it does not at all tally with the information given by those that are the genuine experts in this field. The information seems to come from strange sources, and not from genuine experts in the field. The RDAs are quoted a lot and discussed as if they were important and trustworthy and no names of orthomolecular experts or similar are really mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such an average quality and incomplete guide may be okay for healthy people but for anyone battling serious health issues I would urge them to read far more deeply on this topic than this book allows and to ignore much of the information given in this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite what the authors of this book claim, those of us with serious health issues absolutely need intelligent and often intensive and wide-ranging supplementation along with a healthy diet before we can start to regain our health. We need as much of each nutrient as we actually need, and not just how much the RDA has been arbitrarily set at. Supplement plans must be individualised, as much as possible. We also need to take the right balance of nutrients, and not lots of one thing and none of another related thing. This has absolutely been my experience and holds true for vast numbers of other patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "This sort of diet change is always the first step in improcving health however, and for some lucky people it may be enough. For others it is just the first essential step of many others!\n",
      "\n",
      "(See: Detoxify or Die, Orthomolecular Medicine for Everyone: Megavitamin Therapeutics for Families and Physicians, Primal Body, Primal Mind: Beyond the Paleo Diet for Total Health and a Longer Life and Dr. Atkins' Vita-Nutrient Solution: Nature's Answer to Drugs and others, for more information on this topic.)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The book could have done with having wider margins and more white space on the page, as well as fewer black and white images of foods (many of which looked awful or were hard to make out). Overall the book was very well put together and well edited, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you have read the wonderful books by Taubes, Fallon and Enig, Gedgaudes, Cordain, Price, Sisson, Schwartzbein, Shanahan, Eades etc. this book is still worth reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "I rate this as a 5 star book for healthy people who want to learn to eat better, but not quite a 5 star book when it comes to being a complete guide for those battling serious illnesses. It isn't a complete guide to health for ill people, just a very solid starting point on diet. So that is why I give the book 4 stars overall.\n",

      "\n",
      "The science in this book is questionable, and its conclusions are complete leaps. For example the assertion is made we can use starvation to examine what should make up a healthy diet. Proportions are given for a human body's constituent nutrients, and the conclusion is reached this must be pretty close to a healthy diet. I saw no mention of the, what I believe is established, fact that the body preferentially canabalizes muscle and how that might influence the hypothesis. At one point the China Study is referenced to bolster the anti-gluten argument. I believe the China Studay was heavily critical of cholestoral (though I may be mistaken), but that's just completely ignored.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are just examples and there are many more. Though to be fair, I refused to look at the notes, which are on the authors' website. Maybe all of the science is explained there.\n",

      "To be clear, I am not saying the diet presented is bad or unhealthy. I'm saying if it is healthy, the material failed to convince me.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you, like me, were looking for real science, look elsewhere. Even accounting for the intended audience, I'm not sure any of the material in here is even close to being printable in any scientific journal. If instead you're looking for another diet to try or you enjoy confirmation bias for a \"primal\"-type diet, maybe you'll enjoy this.\n",

This is a woman that suffered the worst sort of betrayal from someone who was supposed to love her and she never recovered for it. She lashes out before anyone gets close. She's closed off and rude. She's the one everyone avoids at a party...except for Lane Cannon.\n",

      "Lane is a man who has his own demons from the past. A previous escort, he's working hard towards his dream career. He's damn good at what he does now, even if the snobbish doctor never ceases to remind him how little she thinks of his lowly sex surrogate ways. But one vulnerable moment leads to some sizzling hate sex and things are irreversibly changed between them forever.\n",

      "\n",
      "There's quite a bit of back and forth that goes on between Elle and Lane. Elle struggles with letting her walls down and in her hard shell of self preservation, hurts Lane on more than one occasion. As much as I wanted to rage at her or judge her, it's tough, knowing her history. This is a woman that has every reason to lose her faith in men and love, so she struggles deeply with accepting Lane's affection.\n",

      "Let me take a minute to recover after that amazing read that I just finished! Holy mother, do I love Roni Loren's series! I was definitely hooked after reading the first installment but just blew my mind. I love Roni’s writing, I loved the enemies to lovers theme of the story, I loved these characters and this smoking hot couple. I loved getting more than I expected because Elle and Lane are surely more than you would expect after reading that “hate to love” blurb. Gah, I am in love!\n",
      "\n",
      "So, is the second novel in the series and, if you have read the first book, you know where it is focused: a sex therapy center. Well, imagine a therapist known as The Ice Queen falling in lust (and love!) with the sex surrogate in the building. You would imagine there is no way for them to become more than a hate fuck, right? Well, you are very wrong because Elle and Lane hide many layers of secrets from each other and as time advances and they start really knowing each other, it’s impossible for those sparks not to turn into love!\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Roni Loren surely knows how to write one hell of an explosive love story! I really enjoyed , the first book in this series, but has totally bewitched me. This author’s writing is absolutely fantastic, the story developed fluently and I loved seeing these two apparently opposite characters unable to fight against their chemistry. It all starts with a mind-blowing hate fuck but that connection after is impossible to stop! As the story progresses and this couple starts showing their true selves to each other, you’ll melt all over the place. Not only because their oh-so-HAWT sex scenes but also because of the emotions that start growing between Lane and Elle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I love erotic romance. I consider it, together with contemporary romance, my absolute favorite genre. And Roni Loren delivered a fantastic piece of erotica with this novel. As I said, not only the sexual tension and the actual sex are off-the-charts but also because Roni built an outstanding relationship between this couple. It’s beautiful to see them opening their hearts, finally leaving all the obstacles aside and starting an amazing relationship. I loved these two together and I wish we could have more because I don’t want to say goodbye to them. Still it’s easier to do it because I am so happy they are living their much deserved happily ever after!\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I am rating with 5 STARS because this enemies to lovers story completely bewitched me. Lane and Elle are such a wonderful couple and I am sure you’ll love reading their explosive and emotional love story. Believe me, all the emotions are completely worth it. You’ll melt with these two and their beautiful connection! I do hope to read more books by Roni Loren because this series worked 100% for me. Highly recommend reading this one!\n",

I really have fish memory so I totally forgot the main characters for this book. A bit recap from previous book, Off the Clock, is about Marin and Donovan who works at a elite health or mental institute called The Grove. It's not an asylum - more like private healing place for troubled rich people. Donovan has a before Marin and this is her story.\n",

Of course, she's a brilliant and successful doctor but her personal life such a disaster. Elle act all tough and impenetrable in her armor but the truth is she's longing for someone real. But her mind is too focused on her ex's lies and betrayal.\n",

He's totally a keeper!\n",

      "Overall, beside their sexy times, I adored this couple with their own problems. No one is perfect. The story was nicely written with steady paced that I couldn't put it down.

      "I did not like this book. I almost DNF'd a few times. This is about Reid and Ever- they were best friends growing up but Ever was 4 years younger than Reid. She was in love with him and he was in love with her and planning to claim her when she turned 18. They did not know they loved each other. How does Reid show his love? By chasing away all the boys that show her any interest while he whores around casually. One of his f*ck buddies gets pregnant on purpose. How you ask? We never find out- maybe he didn't use protection or maybe she had a condom with holes. Either way tells me he wasn't in charge of protection. Ever runs to another state for college because she has no idea he loves her and he is a single parent at this point. Well she runs a week before her 18th birthday so Reid never tells her he loves her. She ignores his calls because it's too painful for her to just be his friend. He lets her go when she doesn't answer his calls- never flies to see her and declare his love. 4 years later she is back and he decides he might pursue her or at least have sex with her. He actually tells her he likes that her boobs are bigger now. Throw in a stalker for Ever, her cheating ex wanting her back and his crazy baby mama and it's a hot mess of cliches. And everyone feels bad for him for having a crazy baby mama- no one calls him on it and says that's what can happen when you have sex with random strangers dummy! He never really owns up that it takes 2 to make a baby and he made the decision to have sex with that girl more than once. Also continued to have casual sex after he was raising his son. Not as often as he would like- his last hookup was 6 months before Ever came back. He feels sorry for himself at one point because as a single dad he doesn't get enough\"Reid time\" to go out with friends, pick up a girl and get laid and then go on with his life the next morning. I didn't like this guy at all. Ever seemed like an easy way to give his son a mom. Reid knew her, was attracted to her, and his son really liked her- it seemed convenient to me. I guess Reid loved her in a way, but not enough to ever fight for her or stay celibate for her. At one point in the book Ever teases him for being such a whore in the past and he says that's because she was born too late and he needed to have his fun! She drops the conversation there- never says how could you sleep with all those women when you say you loved me back then? Nothing! I would have called him on that behavior- its ridiculous. Technically this is safety gang safe because he isn't with anyone in the book, but nothing about this relationship seemed safe to me. He was like an oversexed brat that always gets his way. He whined about the whole she left in his heart when she left, but I never really felt it. He seemed pretty happy with his casual lifestyle before she came back. He was never planning to go after her :( This book gave me a stomach ache.\n",

      "Intercepted chronicles Everleigh White's return to California and her reunion with her childhood best friend and crush, Reid North. Throughout their childhood, Ever and Reid had this instant connection and bond. Feelings and strong emotions were felt between the two but never expressed to one another. So when Reid went off to college and Ever graduated high school, they never expressed and told each other how they felt. The big \"I love you\" was just hanging over their heads. Before Reid got the chance to tell Ever how he felt, Ever ran away and shut off any form of communication with Reid. She figured the distance was worth it because Reid has this new responsibility as a dad and his football career. Well fast forward to the present and Ever is back in town. The feelings that was lingering between Reid and Ever was still burning so bright and stronger than ever. So can the girl who is known for running away finally stay put and acknowledge that the man she loves is asking her to stay put and stop running? Can Ever finally run into the arms of her best friend? Or will their past and exes destroy and intercept their chance at happiness?\n",

      "If you ever read an Emma Hart book, you know that this author puts her heart into every story. The characters are so raw and vulnerable that ever emotion they expressed were seeping throughout the book You could feel how strong their strong emotional and physical connection for each other. Love didn't need to be said because it was felt. There was no denying that this couple finally found each other at the right moment and time in their lives. They may have wasted the years apart, but Ms. Hart showcases that they needed their past and ex-lovers to show them what they always knew. Ever and Reid belonged to one another. I absolutely love the conclusion of this series and it was a book that left a big smile on my face. Thank you Ms. Hart for another great book that will leave hearts to flutter for Reid North.\n",

      "This book is soooo silly. It's fiction, I'm aware of it, but c'mon, don't underestimate my intelligence. This h has stupid written in her forehead when she was 18 and 4 years later the word is still there. I'm not even annoyed I read it. I'm glad actually. I think the kidnapping, and car crashing landing one of the MCs in the hospital being in a induced coma for over 10 days is very overused. And I knew the ex boyfriend wasn't the stalker. That was too predictable. A lot. Like I said, don't underestimate my IQ.\n",

      "Intercepted follows the story of Ever and Reid. Ever and Reid have been best friends for as long as they can remember. Over time, their feelings for one another progressed, but neither one of them acted on their feelings because of their age difference. One of Ever’s biggest regrets was leaving town without saying goodbye to Reid. Now, four years later, Ever is coming home.\n",

      "Reid’s life hasn’t gone as planned. He should be out living the high life, enjoying being famous and young, but life had other plans for him. Tricked into parenthood by his ex, Reid is now a single father. He’s trying to do the best he can, but parenting isn’t easy. The last thing he expected was to run into Ever.\n",

Will Reid and Ever get the HEA that they’ve always dreamed of?\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoyed Intercepted. I love, love the friends to more story-line and this one really knocked it out of the park. I felt the connection between Reid and Ever immediately and was so sad that they lost out on so much time together. Their emotions and attraction were so palpable. I just couldn’t wait to read more. I did find myself frustrated at Ever sometimes, because she was just so stubborn, but Reid being a total alpha male, did an excellent job of pushing past her stubbornness and not letting her go.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I just adored Leo. Such a sweet, loving boy, but also a total smarty pants. I found myself laughing so many times when kept asking if Reid and Ever were giving each other cooties!! Kids have no filter sometimes! I love it. I would definitely be into seeing Leo get his own story down the road. Just putting that out there ;)\n",
      "\n",
      "Intercepted is a great friends to lovers/second chance romance. From the moment I read the first page, I knew this was a story I was going to get lost in. I fell for the characters instantly, even the side characters. Intercepted gave me everything I was looking for and more. I loved the angst, drama, romance, steam and suspense. The story also had some really great twists and turns. I was so intrigued with the story-line and was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next. This book can be read as a stand-alone, however I do recommend that you do read Blindsided and Sidetracked first.\n",

      "Subtitled, “The Gruesome Crimes Behind Our Romance With the Macabre,” this is a look at some real life murder cases between 1811-1837 (what he describes as the macabre, ‘Golden Age’ of murder); although the book actually takes us up to the time of Jack the Ripper in 1888. At times, the authors prose is a little flowery – he describes the era as the, “High Noon of Romanticism,” but somehow the style seems to suit the time he is writing about. These are murders of a time now vanished, although many of them excited debate and much interest at the time, many will be unfamiliar. As well as examining the murders themselves, the author looks at these events from the period of literature – how they influenced authors and how they led to the modern metropolitan murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are four parts to this book. The first looks at a murder in 1823, which caused press fascination and much interest from authors such as Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray and Robert Browning – who all followed the case closely. The murder involves gambling men and a body fished out from a brook; the public both appalled and secretly delighted as the facts were gradually unearthed. In 1836, we have the ‘Case of the Mutilated Corpse’ in which parts of a body were found in various parts of the country. In 1840 there is the murder of Lord William Russell, which caused disquiet even in Buckingham Palace. As the book moves, ‘Towards the Ripper,’ we read of the Ratcliffe Highway Murders and of Whitechapel in 1888.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an interesting look at the beginning of murder as entertainment, detouring from Thomas De Quincey, through the Gothic and Romantic period and looking at some influential murder cases. I enjoyed the earlier part of the book more as I knew virtually nothing about the earlier cases, but towards the end I was more familiar with the murders covered. This is certainly an evocative and fascinating read- the author cleverly recreates a time when you can imagine candlelight giving way to flickering gas lamps, when carriages clattered past, but where human frailties and crimes are just as relevant, sadly, as they are today.\n",
      "Review 3\n",

      "I so rarely rate books I didn't finish, but let me give you this - the two stars is because the author obviously put in a lot of work into the research and references.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this was one of the most obnoxiously pretentious, deeply tedious, self-congratulatory smug-ass books I've ever picked up in my entire life. If you like a hyper-intellectual cramming four ten-dollar words into every sentence to drive the point home that he's just that much more cultured than everybody else while simultaneously reveling in some sort of masturbatory euphoria at murders - mainly murders of women, natch - while simultaneously taking a big ol' steaming dump on the mystery fans most likely to pick up this book, be my guest. He's all yours.\n",

      "First the cover drive me in then I read the blurb. A non fiction about murder in victorian era just sounded like something I would like but unfortunately this was a dud. I thought the information about the different cases and such was barley touched on. Feelt like I would get more facts by somone running and screaming random facts outside my apartment that I could barley hear. It just wasn't delwed enough into topics for my liking. It wasn't eerie and atsmospheric as I had hoped. It was a very quick read though.\n",

      "We know from Stolen by an Alien Callie has been brutalized by another alien species. So, I knew it was going to be bad. My heart hurt so much for her. I cannot even imagine what she went through. She was truly a strong heroine to come out of all of that and become an amazing mate to Zadeon. I really appreciate the author \"hinted\" at or minimized the descriptions of her captivity. It was bad enough just imagining what happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "And let me tell you, this author knows how to write a perfect swoon-worthy hero. Zadeon was amazing! He did everything right for Callie. I hurt for him too seeing his mate in the condition she is and not being able to do anything about it. But he truly did. He was there for her and became the rock she needed to pull herself out of her depression and move forward and realize she is NOT what happened to her....she is so much more than that and it is only one part of her life.\n",
      "\n",

      "And oh lord...I had a feeling I knew what was going to happen. There were hints throughout the book and I kept praying that it wasn't going to be true. But, it was. I cannot even imagine THAT scenario. Callie's initial reaction was totally understandable. And Zadeon...did I mention he was the hero? He was so amazing and strong and his reaction was so sweet and heartfelt. He was there for her and helped her to pull through it and realize what it truly was...a blessing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely LOVED book 1. And while this one was good, it didn't work quite as well for me. I felt the first 25-40% of the book was disjointed and choppy. I had to go back and reread the first two chapters to make sure I wasn't missing something. After about the 40% mark, it began to get better though I don't think it ever reached the writing level of book 1. I'm not sure what happened here. That's not to say I still didn't enjoy the book because I did. I will definitely keep reading this series and I'm looking forward to the next book. However, I can say, I really have no interest in Gracie unless she improves. She's just not the type of heroine I like. I really hate Dohrien was paired with her...just my two cents.\n",

      "Set in New York in 1886 for no reason, young Daphne Byrne and her mother are mourning the recent death of her beloved dad - but no-good mediums is out to take advantage of their grief! And demons haunt Daphne too! You know Rosemary’s Baby? It’s that but worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this is another Hill House stinker! I wasn’t entertained by any of it. Mediums are frauds?! Say it ain’t so! Except, weirdly, spirits and the afterlife here are real so mediums are charlatans not because they claim to tap into a realm that isn’t there, because that realm does exist in this book, but because they just don’t have the ability like Daphne does. Or maybe Daphne’s imagining it all…? Eh, I don’t care. And she’s not. And the sceptic character ain’t a great person either so both sides get stupidly blasted by Laura Marks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Veteran artist Kelley Jones draws this one. He’s drawn everything from Batman to Sandman in a multi-decades-long career and you’re either a fan at this point or you’re not - his style isn’t going to change. I’ve never really dug Jones’ art and he’s definitely not doing his best work on this book. The horror is cliched and the character designs are inconsistent and ugly. Honestly, these are the oldest teenagers in the world - some of the girls look like middle-aged male bus drivers on a stag night.\n",
      "\n",
      "There isn’t much else to say. The dull story ends on an overfamiliar horror trope and the whole thing is unimpressive and instantly forgettable. Horror’s a tough genre to get right as Laura Marks proves with her feeble Daphne Byrne.\n",

      "\n",
      "The story itself was really more of a three star read, but the art was super good! Especially the pictures between each chapter. Stuff of nightmares really. The blood and violence was super intense at times and had me cringing and hissing through my teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I enjoyed it a lot, but I’m also into dark reads. I would only recommend this to those who don’t shy away from the darkest of books and pictures. There are no happy moments here. And some of these pictures are intense and scary. Don’t stare for too long or a bloody hand might reach out and grab you!!!\n",

      "I'm sorry to say that I couldn't get very far in this book. The dialog was just too immature and I wasn't drawn into the story at all. I know others really liked it, as evidenced by the overall rating, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.\n",

      "Crazy, intense story. I thought it would be just a normal mail order bride story of coming to the west, finding the husband she wrote to, and boom—romance blossoms. But no, there is some nasty business going on in the town of Come-by-Chance, Montana. When Emily escapes Chicago after witnessing a murder, she thinks nothing worse can happen. She is sooooo wrong. I won’t be a spoil-sport, but just know, nothing is as it seems…and keeping secrets is never a good option. But to an innocent girl fresh off the train with no one else in the world to love or watch out for her, secrets bind her. There is a romance in this, but it comes after wading through a lot of muck. Poor Emily triumphs in the end, but there are other side characters I’m dying to know about now whose lives didn’t tie up into happy bows at the end of this one.\n",

      "The only reason I even gave this book 2 stars was because it had a good plot. I found this book in the religious section but I could count the numbers of times on 1 hand how many times it even made a REFERENCE to God. And that's all it did -- make references. No more than 2-3 might I add. I felt that if it was a 'Christian' book there should certainly be no swearing, but, there were 2 swear words in this book. I wasn't very pleased with the 2 slang words in the book either, but I know devoted Christians who use slang words so that didn't bother me AS much. But it still bothered me\n",

      "Maybe I'm being too harsh but this series is just not working for me. The heroine continues to piss me off non stop and is consistently controlled by her hormones. Not only that she's annoying in forgiving and then hating on her men, it's such a back and forth I have whiplash. If there were ever a girl who should make her men work for it, its her. She also continues to let herself be manipulated and controlled by those around her when really I wonder why she doesn't just burn the world to the ground. I was a bit shocked by a revelation/secret from one of her men, I was expecting him to be the stable and sedate one yet he's causing more of an uproar than even the brooding grump of a twin. Also I really could have done without the whole beautiful teacher coming in & latching onto one of her men creating some messed up fake relationship where everybody is playing everyone and out for themselves. On the cliche front we have the evil nemesis turning into a friend and I just could care less. I'll continue on mostly because I am curious about the headmistress's grand plan and how the heroine plays into that. I also want to learn more about her vampire, he's been hidden underground for hundreds of years for a reason and honestly he is the only daring thing I felt the heroine has done thus far.\n",

A distraught woman has contacted them after the murder of her husband, and our intrepid duo find the police are looking no further than her as their culprit. But did she do it? As Cindy and Mattheus delve further into the case they find no end to the secrets, lies, and betrayals.\n",

      "This is a horror novel told from the point of view of a new mother who has recently had her first baby and is entrenched in the difficulties of that endeavor, while also things around her seem to be beyond her control. She grapples with all the vicissitudes of life to regain control and responds with unique strategies, but she is an unreliable narrator, and the reader soon sees what she refuses to see. The book is written in first person, with an easily digestible narrative that flows quickly. Willow Rose is a good writer. I like her stories because they all have a very similar voice and tone. Although the end is a bit predictable, it still is an enjoyable read.\n",

I couldn't help but think of John Waters Serial Mom suffering from postpartum depression whilst reading this little gem. I have quite a few Willow Rose books in my Kindle library but this is my first read by this author. I’ve been looking forward to finally getting around to reading one of her books and believe this was a good choice to start. Very entertaining, fast paced and a surprise ending. I really do enjoy this genre when you are able to chuckle a bit...and there was no shortage of that throughout. Recommend if your looking for a fun quick read.\n",

      "I'm not sure if our h Anna is to stupid to live or just very young. She is eighteen and has no social life at all. No siblings or friends. Her mother has been dead for several years. How a fabulously wealthy eighteen year old has been allowed to live on her own for the past five years without a guardian is never explained. Anyway she has still developed the skill of an advanced card shark and is duped into forcing a dimwit Marquess or whatever he was into marrying her. Then she does one stupid thing after another. But she was nice to poor people and only eighteen so I was willing to cut her some slack.\n",
      "\n",
      "The H Charles is 32 and described as having a double chin and a receding hairline. Be still my heart. He is a big wig at the foreign office and is in charge of the whole french spy thing. Incredibly the English still eventually won the war. He is the king of misunderstanding. He constantly is in a sulk or pout or refusing to speak to her because he has misread the situation. Most issues could have been cleared up with an honest question. For example \"So what did you do this afternoon\" ? Instead when he sees his wife returning from doing charity work he assumes she is off having an affair. Seriously only an extremely lonely 18 year old would put up with this guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles does always stand up for her to his mother though I'll give him that. His mother hates Anna because her father was married to her (the mothers') sister and broke her heart by having the big affair with Anna's mother. The epilogue goes on to tell how she is really starting to like Anna after all. Not in this life time. If eye rolling gives you a headache you may want to skip this one\n",

      "\" Il marchese congedò il suo maggiordomo e chiuse con attenzione le porte della biblioteca lui stesso, prima di fare cenno al suo amico di sedersi sulla comoda poltrona Club vicino al caminetto e di versare due bicchieri di porto. Si sedette su una larga sedia davanti al fuoco, dove l’odore del carbone che bruciava era più forte.\n",
      "“Non potrei dover sottolineare di più il fatto che sia necessaria un’estrema segretezza” disse Haverstock con voce più bassa del suo normale tono di comando. “Devo essere particolarmente cauto, in questa casa piena di maledette femmine.”\n",
      "Ralph “Morgie” Morgan prese un bel sorso di porto. “Non so come fate a tollerarlo, amico mio. Cinque sorelle.” Morgie rabbrividì come se il porto fosse stato avvelenato.\n",
      "“Ce ne sono rimaste solo quattro, ora che ho fatto sposare Mary.”\n",
      "“Oh, fantastico. Solo quattro” disse Morgie generoso.\n",
      "Fu il turno del marchese di rabbrividire. Se avesse distribuito altre quattro doti, non sarebbe stato in grado di sposarsi lui. Non che volesse farlo, ma comunque malediceva suo padre per averlo lasciato con fondi così limitati.\n",
      "Come se leggesse il pensiero dell’amico, Morgie disse: “Non siete davvero costretto a dare delle doti sostanziose alle ragazze. Dovete pur lasciare qualcosa per voi stesso.\n",
      "“Allora non sarei migliore di mio padre.”\n",

      "Anna de Mouchet è figlia di un duca e di una nobile francese sfuggita alla rivoluzione, ma non appartiene al ton. I suoi genitori si sono amati fino alla morte del padre, ma non erano sposati, il padre infatti era già sposato con la cognata del Marchese di Haverstock. Alla sua morte, dato che la moglie legittima non gli aveva dato nessun erede, è Anna ad ereditare tutto ciò che non è legato al titolo, e questo il Marchese non lo ha mai perdonato all’amante del cognato. Gli anni successivi li ha passati facendo in modo che Anna non potesse frequentare le scuole più in voga per le fanciulle del tempo e non venisse accettata in società, nonostante la sua grande fortuna.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ora che Haverstock è morto, il figlio Charles si trova non solo in ristrettezze economiche ma anche nella necessità di riportare onore alla casata, che il padre ha infangato con il suo comportamento indegno. Per questo con grande fervore, e in segreto, lavora per la Corona. Anna invece è diventata una giovane donna di grande bellezza, dedita alle opere di carità e piena di spirito patriottico verso l’Inghilterra, che lei considera la sua sola e unica patria. Ed è proprio su questo che conta l’uomo che le propone di spiare Charles, convincendola che sia una spia. Attuando un piano, arriverà a diventare la Marchesa di Haverstock per poterlo controllare e vendicarsi così dei torti che questa casata ha fatto alla madre, morta da qualche anno. Eppure nonostante abbia sposato Charles per vendetta, ben presto la giovane donna si scopre innamorata di suo marito. La passione fisica che è esplosa fra loro è intensa, ma i sospetti di entrambi non permettono a nessuno dei due di esternare i loro sentimenti. E passerà molto tempo prima che ogni dubbio venga fugato.\n",
      "\n",
      "Da qualche tempo a questa parte sto scoprendo molte brave autrici grazie a Babelcube. Questo libro è il primo di una serie che racconta le vicende dei fratelli Haverstock. Charles si è preso il compito di riportare onore al nome della sua casata, per questo grazie alla sua intelligenza lavora in segreto per vincere la guerra contro i francesi. Ed è proprio mentre si accinge a partire per una missione di grande importanza, che si vede costretto a cedere al ricatto di una donna, che considera poco più di una prostituta. Durante tutta la sua giovinezza, infatti, ha sentito ogni giorno sua madre maledire l’amante del cognato, dandole la colpa per l’infelicità, e la sterilità della sorella, e doversi piegare ai suoi piani lo umilia profondamente. Eppure non appena se la trova fra le braccia, per consumare e rendere valido il matrimonio, si rende conto che Anna pur con tutto il suo fascino è ancora innocente, e non può resistere alla passione che scaturisce fra di loro quando si toccano. Non può fare a meno di desiderarla e scopre con piacere che è una compagna deliziosa e incredibilmente intelligente, ma non si fida e tutto precipita quando con sgomento si rende conto che potrebbe aver sposato una nemica dell’Inghilterra.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anche Anna è divorata dai dubbi, sposa Charles per patriottismo, convinta che sia come il padre, un uomo senza onore. Eppure quando vede come ama la sua famiglia, e come intenda comportarsi in modo amabile, anche con lei, che lo ha ricattato per farsi sposare, si rende conto di essersi sbagliata. Ma essendo all’oscuro del suo vero lavoro, le persone che frequenta le fanno credere che davvero possa essere una spia. C’è passione fra loro ed anche una strana piacevole intimità, ma entrambi non posso fidarsi e questo giocherà a favore di chi li sta manovrando.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sono tutti personaggi molto ben caratterizzati i fratelli Haverstock, e mentre osserviamo maturare il legame fra i protagonisti, vediamo anche nascere l’amore fra Lydia e Morgie, l’amico di Charles, ed assistiamo hai maneggi di Kate per mettere le mani sul nipote di un vecchio Duca senza eredi legittimi. È un libro che si legge in modo piacevole, con una buona traduzione ed una trama ben articolata, sto già leggendo il secondo capitolo “Duchessa per sbaglio” che vede come protagonista Elizabeth, una delle sorelle, e il Duca di Aldridge. L’unica pecca ed anche il motivo per cui non raggiunge un punteggio migliore è la troppa semplicità con cui Anna riesce a farsi sposare, un piano un po’ troppo semplice e un Morgie un po’ troppo credulone, difficile da digerire, ma questo non toglie che mi sia comunque goduta questa lettura leggera e piacevole.\n",

      "This book started in a very interesting way. It was about Anna the bastard daughter of a French emigre and an English aristocrat. Her mother wants her to be brought up like other English misses. But Anna's father's family refuses and the mother-daughter stay as outcasts till the mothers death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna is then offered a chance to take revenge on her father's family. This - by cheating at cards and getting married into the family because she believes the hero to be traitor. What is the point of exposing someones activities - when he is her husband? A wife is not allowed to testify in court and after everything she would remain his wife! Thus tainting herself AND her future children. No logic...\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Anna forces her husband - the Marquis of Haverstock - to consummate the marriage so that it cannot be annulled at a later date.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all this deception and inherent suspicion, both the hero or heroine keep admiring and appreciating one another! The heroine abandons all attempts to seduce the truth of her husband's traitorous activities and coolly sets off with his sisters to buy them new clothes. Such behavior really challenges your credulity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prose is really poor with a lot of cliche'd phrases like \"petal soft skin\".\n",
      "I marked this book as Read but I couldn't get beyond 50 pages or so and am not likely to continue.\n",
      "Review 5\n",

      "Pretty good read! I liked all the characters. Anna is sweet, loveable, and a little naive. I can't stand when female characters are so stupidly misled, but even so it did not distract from the book. Got for free. Goid book pd for or not.\n",

      "This is the first of Tim Cahill's books I have read, and I have three others in my shelf.\n",
      "This is a collection of short stories, and as I understand it some have been published in magazines or news papers previously.\n",
      "\n",
      "They cover a variety of locations, although around half are set in the USA. They are loosely categorised into the following headings: The Unnatural World, Tooth and Claw, The Natural World, Other Peoples Lives, and Risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a real mixture of stories provided, from fire fighters in Kuwait, Bison in Yellowstone National Park, Kayaking in Baja to traveller's diarrhea, Australian slang and racing a 'chariot' constructed from a 44 gallon oil drum.\n",
      "\n",
      "As might be expected there were good stories and stories that appealed less. There were some very good ones, where Cahill described events very well, and had interesting quirks or situations - generally the animal related stories and the actual travel stories appealed more to me than the more abstract. Also the Risk section quickly became tiresome - a middle aged man undertaking adventure sports - just not my wheelhouse. In some respects it is a shame this section was located at the end of the book, as my take away memory wasn't good.\n",

      "I am not a big fan of Bill Bryson, but this book reminded me a little of him and his writing\n",

      "\n",
      "3 stars.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "What made me want to read this book? The title and cover, mostly. I then read the description and listened to the introduction on Audible. Since it made me laugh considerably, I went ahead and got it. I sadly have to say that this was more than a disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were informed in the introduction that there would be next to no ducks in this. That's fine with me. What I would have wanted was some kind of red thread leading the reader through the book. And maybe a laugh or two since it was advertised as \"vivid and outrageously funny\".\n",
      "Instead, we got the ramblings of a guy who travels a lot.\n",
      "I honestly felt as if I was seated next to him at a party, desperately trying to escape while he keeps telling me of his many travels, boring me half to death, because I don't know WHY he's telling me this or that story and because his way of telling the various stories is almost putting me to sleep.\n",
      "Don't get me wrong, travelling is fascinating and being able to travel so much and to so many exotic places even more so, but these tales were almost as bad as him reciting his grocery list.\n",
      "This was supposedly about exotic places and strange encounters ... frankly, I didn't see it. Some stories were slightly interesting (like the reason why llamas spit if they do that at all), others were amusing (like the Throne of Doom), most were just boring and felt pointless.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writing style was also ... mediocre? No cadence, no nothing. Like I said: as if I was trapped next to a guy at a party who thinks himself oh so interesting while having no actual skill for storytelling whatsoever.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I wasn't allergic to DNFing a book ...\n",
      "\n",
      "Why the 2 stars then? Because of the introduction and the story about Kuwait.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "It took me forever to finish this book -- and I can't really figure out why. I like it, it's interesting, funny, and well-written. It just failed to... capture me. I suspect that I'm not terribly familar with personalities like TC's. When I read travel memoirs, they're usually more Bill Bryson-esque -- inept people falling over logs -- or Tony Horwitz-esque -- passionate intellectual dorks mixing humor and social commentary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, I suspect TC has a beard. An unironic beard. I suspect everyone he hangs out with has unironic beards also. He probably goes to gritty bars in small towns in Mexcio where the bartender knows him by name. He drinks from shot glasses whatever Ernest Hemingway would have drunk. He was in Wherever, Third World just after the revolution. He was on the last steamboat out of Wherever just before the revolution started. He probably knows how to smoke, not because he's a smoker but because it's one of those things men like him just know how to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think he's probably an old school conservationist -- the kind who know how to gut things and who want to save the natural world so they can continue to be rugged out on it. (As opposed to the sort I'm more familiar with -- 22 year old women with lower back tatoos who want to swim with the dolphins.) If TC has a tatoo, I suspect it's green.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, so much unironic manliness was a bit like taking a shot of testosterone straight to the head. Made me wonder if I should stop reading to scratch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The irony is that sometimes TC thinks he is Bill Bryson. He knows guys much tougher than he is and so in comparison he feels like the one falling off logs. He's the writer who can climb a mountain rather than a mountain climber. So there's this weird self-aware / lack of self-awareness thing going on -- \"Oh yes, I'm writing in this tough manly tradition. Oh but I'm subverting the tradition by not being tough and manly. Oh but see how tough and manly I am because I do it all anyway.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which brings me back around to the fact that it is a good collection, just maybe from a world I don't know much about. The piece on the llamas alone is worth giving it shelf space. But I'm pretty sure Tim Cahill and I don't travel the same way, go the same places, or do any of the same things when we get there.\n",

      "Halfway up the face of El Capitan, Yosemite, the climbing partner above him needs to relieve himself. Tempting the glacier to ice-bomb his kayak in Glacier Bay, Alaska. Finding his snowshoes ineffective going up the White Mountains, New Hampshire. Nightly dancing his version of the lambada–the “cowboy” lambada–to music from a radio hooked to a car battery with a shy teen girl high up in Peru’s Andes. Taking paragliding lessons “to float upon the wind, high above the mute and pitiless clay.” Caving among Lechuguilla’s impossible crystals. Learning the lowriding culture of tricked out cars in LA. Killing oil well fires in Kuwait where Iraqis had defecated in every room in the country. Sharing a campfire with fishermen in the Sea of Cortez, Baja California. Of these and many others, Cahill gives a true sense of the actual experience, straight from the gut, not taken too seriously. Great, great fun to read.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This book has a number of pros and a number of cons. My opinion flip flopped from good to bad as I read through the 300 or so pages. I eventually settled on a Do Not Read...although there were many parts I really enjoyed...so it's a very tentative Do Not Read. In other words, I might recommend it to a specific person but not to everyone I know.\n",
      "The title is what initially drew me in. Pecked to Death by Ducks - that sounds funny. Then I noticed a comment on the cover comparing Cahill's writing to Anthony Bourdain and P.J. O'Rourke. I was in the mood for a snarky, wit filled, pithy travel log. The book's prologue is an explanation of the title where Cahill suggests he has a great sense of humour and that is why his books have such funny titles. Great, a humour book..or in this case, my first expectation shot down.\n",
      "The first chapter is intense. Very well written, not in a funny way, but in a shocking way that pulls you right in. Cahill describes a trip to Kuwait post Iraq war. Dead bodies, eerily quiet abandoned beachside resorts, and the flaming hells of the oil fires. It's a scene out of the apocalypse. What a great start to the book. A five star rating...but, that chapter soon ended and the book never made it back to that level.\n",
      "Many many more stories followed. From quick snippets of Cahill's trips to strange and exotic South Pacific islands to mundane accounts of his local travels through Montana. A handful of his travel accounts were interesting, but, the majority were mediocre and bland. Perhaps it was because I don't rock climb or take part in 'rope work' (there were more than a few chapters dealing with his mountain climbing or cave dropping) that I lost interest rather quickly.\n",
      "The humour and wit that was advertised on the book's cover was non existent from what I could tell. The few attempts at sarcasm, witty references, or jokes fell flat (like my souffles or Flat Stanley). I was very disappointed because my expectations were for a funny travel journal\n",

Her vampires plan human rather well and stick up for her when her parents attack her. Suddenly, the vampires and Piper are summoned to visit the vampires’ sire.

      "SO glad I kept reading these books! This series is perfect for someone looking for a different twist to paranormal romance. These complicated relationships will keep you up reading through the night. The main character Piper finds herself employed as the maid for SIX 🤤GORGEOUS vampires but she also has a dangerous admirer. While reading you’ll start to wonder if Piper will developed true feelings for one or all of her employers? Throw in some funny mishaps and you got yourself a great new series to keep you entertained. Again I gave the book 4stars because of typos and the parent scene felt like something was missing. I thought a twist should’ve been added to that part of the story. Impatiently waiting for book3!\n",

      "Piper has kissed two of the men, but now the others are becoming more friendly. They are all falling for her so when her parents show up the men protect her against her devious scheming parents. But they have been called to go to meet their sire and Valentine has been stalking Piper. He as orchestrated it so that Piper has to go to their sire also, so to keep her safe she has to bond with one of the men. But with six men she’s attracted to whom will she choose? Her choice was surprising. I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.\n",

      "The \"steampunk\" in the title is a little misleading, which is fine by me--I'm not super-interested in clockwork and steam engines for their own sake. Many of the stories aren't really even about ghosts, or at least they don't seem particularly \"ghosty\" to me. There are Satanic enclaves, mad inventors and their hideous machines, mummies, and time travel, all loosely bound together with phantasmagoric ties. The real throughline of the collection is the nineteenth century, that spooky, obsessive period of colonial expansion and industralization. The stories are all well-written, though some fall short of truly chilling effects. Standouts for me were Laird Barron's \"Blackwood's Baby,\" and Peter Beagle's \"Music, When Soft Voices Die.\" Garth Nix's \"The Curious Case of the Moondawn Daffodils Murder\" is a light, funny takeoff on Conan Doyle, and a break from the generally grim proceedings. A solid collection, with good representation from Australia and the UK--though of 17 stories, 14 are by men. (We do notice these things, folks.)\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Ghosts by Gaslight is the perfect example of what a short story collection ought to be. Though the stories are meant to convey a sense of dread (and indeed, many of them do - especially Lucius Shepard's dirty little tale), I found myself utterly delighted as I read each story. It has always seemed to me that ghost stories are best suited for briefness - else the author runs the risk of losing the tension. And yet, I am often frustrated by short stories that seem as though the author plucked them from some greater tale - endings are not quite endings, the characters and their motives seen unbeknownst to the poor reader. The varied authors of the tales in Ghosts by Gaslights have avoided this trap to the one.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's fairly common in multi-author collections to have pieces that are, well, filler. I didn't find a single piece of fill in this entire collection. Certainly, there are some stand-outs (Lucius Shepard, for one, as mentioned above), but each and every author seems to have brought their best to bear. I was especially impressed at how many managed the particular cadence of Victorian-era tales, without seeming to descend into parody.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would also note that the steampunk nature of the collection is profoundly understated. There's not a single dirigible to be had, and for these small things this particular reader is endlessly grateful.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Esta antología, editada por Jack Dann y Nick Gevers, contiene relatos ambientados a finales del XIX y principios del XX, siempre con elementos sobrenaturales, sobre todo fantasmas, y en alguna ocasión un toque steampunk. Me ha resultado una recopilación algo irregular, frase bastante tópica por otro lado cuando se habla de colecciones de cuentos, donde los hay de todas las calidades. Destacaría el de James Morrow, que precisamente comienza el libro.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I also, did not think there was much steampunk in these stories. A hint here and there, that was about it. Obviously some stories were better than others. But most on the bad side.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I found this book disappointing, not because of the quality of the writing, but because of the marketing. To call this anthology 'steampunk' is like calling a foot an ear. They don't look the same, work the same, or meet the same needs of their users.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steampunk elements are weak. In fact, they are as transparent as the haunts that appear in Ghosts by Gaslight. The publisher should have subtitled this tone \"Stories of Victorian Supernatural Suspense\". These stories are light on steampunk elements and heavy on Victorian ghost tales. Combing the two could have been fun, but sadly, this book failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I imagine some marketing person at Harper Voyager saying \"Hey, steampunk's hot right now, let's call these steampunk.\" It was a marketing ploy to sell a few extra copies (hey, it enticed me to buy one!), but it also risked alienating readers (like me!).\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not to say Ghost by Gaslight is a terrible book. The writing mimics the Victorian age (think Charles Dickens) to the point that some of the stories are difficult to read. What is missing is the steampunk technology, sense of adventure and alternate history (think Gail Carriger and Stephen Hunt) that brings other streampunk stories alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you like Victorian-style ghost stories, you might enjoy this anthology.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are a steampunk purest, I do not recommend reading this book. There are better anthologies that will satisfy you more.\n",

      "The characters in Yoshihiro Tatsumi's comics are sad. They are sad in the something is missing way. There are good reasons to be sad, if you need reasons. Getting old. Getting cold. Political reasons of being sad. The whole place getting old and cold along with them. The faces are identical expressions of sad. Almost inhuman. I squinted my eyes and the drawings could have been of primates. Stuck in a zoo some place. Labeled No Longer Erectus (yeah, some of these guys can't get it up anymore on top of everything else). They could have felt a moving feeling traveling from one person to another like an infection you wouldn't want to share. I don't know. I wasn't feeling a mood as much as species... Feelings too permanent... I don't know. I don't think you can catch that so much as get mounted on the wall next to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a part missing. The part missing from the self that's hidden. It's the voice in your own head that you don't know what it is going to say next. It's the ability to be surprised. (I try not too think too hard so I can get this more often. It's the part that gets me into trouble when I don't think before I talk. Oops.) You could call it hope, I guess. I call it a part of yourself that keeps you from being utterly alone. These stories almost lacked that part completely. There was no life. The plaque was mounted. The museum has opening hours of 11 a.m. until 4 p.m. It shouldn't have been that way (the first story was about a photographer who took a photo of what seemed to be a moving glimpse of enduring family life before the black rain of Hiroshima. A man and a country scramble to profit on the signs of their own victimhood and tears. Make it a holiday. That's not a photograph! That's today). Sometimes.... I liked the story 'Sky Burial' the best. A man doesn't move with his neighbors. He stays alone in the building with the dead body, unwilling to move himself. He looks into the sky to see vultures all over his building. They know dead things when they see it. I liked the old man who chooses to live alone in the wilderness in his middle age after a life handed over to office work. His mental energies are exhausted on a rash. He's still working too hard. All of the old men want a young and pretty woman. The women give themselves away to them when they are tossed aside by a younger man. Is that their only direction?\n",
      "These guys (and women) all have vultures... It's that there is no other direction. The end story is Good-bye. A prostitute (for soldiers. She's not too well liked by her fellow Japanese, obviously) forces her father to have sex with her (hey, just like the dream sequence in Norma Jean & Marilyn) so that he'll be \"just another man\" to her. \"Good-bye.\" I don't know. Is that good bye? It's burial, isn't it? That's what giving up is.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd want to scream. There's a part missing. Good-bye is an interesting book about being buried alive, I guess. Maybe I should read it as that and move along in the mausoleum of corpses... It's closing time. Should I have been living their lives more than they were? Maybe I didn't really LIKE this...\n",

      "Are you sad if you are always sad?\n",
      "\n",
      "P.s. Okay, so I didn't agree with Tatsumi's version of events either. When a young man dresses up in his sister's clothes he is spied on by someone he knows (it was a haunting image of the house burned down and the mirror he is seeing looking into cracked. Either from the fire or from self disgust. I liked that it wasn't stated). The mate thinks he dressed up as a girl because his many sisters and mother pressured him to be more of a man. I thought he was kissing the girl him in the mirror because he was lonely. The make up was to look like someone else. Someone else to love. Almost...\n",

      "And if you are going to get into the whole politics (which others have said about this book that it was politics and maybe it was. But the thing about politics, since it isn't the '70s anymore...If it connects to now...)... It still matters about the missing part.\n",

      "The first story in this collection - aptly titled \"Hell\" - is a masterpiece. It concerns a photojournalist who gains fame and respect for a heartbreaking photo he took during the aftermath of the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima. Years later, he discovers that the subject of his photograph is not quite what it seems. The story includes starkly horrific images of atomic bomb victims, and it serves as a complex examination of Japan's status as both the victims and perpetrators of wartime atrocities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the stories find a sense of ennui and frustration in the underbelly of post-war Japan. Tatsumi's cartooning style is a little reminiscent of Will Eisner's, and like Eisner, he has a talent for crafting compelling small-scale melodramas about the lives of cheaters, gamblers, sex workers, drinkers, and losers. A few of the stories are dated (society's views have thankfully evolved a little bit since the early 1970's), but they're always interesting. The title story appears at the end of the collection. It deals with a young woman who sleeps with American GIs during the occupation, and her relationship with her father, a former soldier in the Japanese military. It exemplifies the best of Tatsumi's approach - blending the personal and political into an affecting story with no easy answers.\n",

      "\n",
      "I had so much fun reading Shattered by Control. I loved the dynamic between Fynn and Mirella and how they grappled for control. At first Mirella is all business and committed to do her job, get paid and leave, but the heat and attraction between them could not be denied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this is the third book in this interconnected standalone series it is my first book by BB Hamel. I loved it so much I plan on reading the rest 4.5-stars\n",

      "==============\n",
      "SHATTERED BY CONTROL is the third instalment in BB Hamel’s contemporary, adult, dark Mafia romance series focusing on the Bruno family. This is Fynn Bruno, and physio therapist Mirella Falconet’s story line. SHATTERED CONTROL can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty but I recommend reading the previous instalments for back story and cohesion including Consumed by Desire, and Broken Sin.\n",
      "\n",
      "WARNING: Due to the nature of the story line premise, there may be triggers for more sensitive readers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Told from dual first person perspectives (Mirella and Fynn) SHATTERED BY CONTROL focuses on Fynn Bruno whose life spiralled out of control, having been shot close to a dozen times, leaving our hero in a coma for several months. With need for a physio-therapist, Bruno family capo Genaro Bernero recommends Mirella Falconet, a recent graduate from the PT doctoral program, a woman with very little experience but a woman who knows more about the Mafia lifestyle than she ever wanted to know. What ensues is the building but acrimonious relationship between Mirella and Fynn, and the fall-out as the past returns demanding compensation and payment for territory and lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mirella Falconet’s life was about to change when Fynn Bruno offers Mirella a position she cannot refuse. Turning down the Bruno family is next to impossible, and Mirella finds herself falling for a man she knows nothing about. Mirella’s father left when she was ten years old, swearing allegiance to the Bruno Famiglia, leaving his wife and young daughter behind. Mirella has never forgiven her father but secrets will reveal another story, another sin, another lie to add to Mirella’s already fractured and bleeding heart. Fynn Bruno needs physio-therapy in an effort to show a more powerful front but Fynn is hoping for a miracle from our story line heroine, a miracle that Mirella knows will be a long time coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationship between Mirella and Fynn is an enemies to lovers, of a sorts, in which Mirella has no choice but to work for the Bruno family but a war between the Mafia and the Irish Mob is fast approaching, and our heroine is about to be caught in the middle, a pawn to be sold to the highest bidder. From the outset Fynn’s attraction is Mirella is palpable and strong, his road to seduction is demanding. The $ex scenes are intimate and erotic, with some scenes of spanking and discipline.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are reintroduced to Fynn’s brother and the Bruno Famiglia Don Casso and his wife Olivia; their sister Karah and her husband Nico; brother Gavino, step-mother Elise, as well as Mirella’s parents, and Ronan and Cillian O’Shea.\n",
      "\n",
      "SHATTERED BY CONTROL is a story of family, betrayal and vengeance, secrets and lies, love and understanding. The premise is dark and captivating; the romance is seductive and provocative; the characters are charismatic and entertaining.\n",

      "Shattered by Control is final installment in the Bruno family saga. A Dark Mafia Romance. This is Fynn and Mirella story. It's a standalone full-length novel with no cliffhanger and a guaranteed happily-ever-after. A fast paced, action packed, pulse-pounding romantic and a steamy enemies-to-lovers, hate-to-love ride with twists and turns from start finish. It's filled with suspense, lies, drama, danger, violence, hatred, betrayal, lust, enemies, secrets, deception, retaliation, pain, anger, attacks, mob war, attempted murder, revelations, surprises, hatred, resentment, kidnapping, family loyalty, passion, power and control, dominance, spanking, steam lots of steam and love.\n",
      "Fynn Bruno is the middle brother of the powerful Italian mafia family of Arizona. He was brutally shot in a shooting that forces him onto the sidelines of a raging mafia war between Italians and the Irish. Fynn injuries caused him to lose consciousness and succumb to a coma for several months. When he awakes he was suffered from lower extremity weakness and limited mobility from laying still for months. He needs a discreet physical therapist help him get back on his feet. That's how the beautiful Mirella Falconet stumbled into his life. Mirella recently graduated as a physical therapist and she's also the estrange daughter of the capo of the Bruno organization. Fynn is a powerful man and he can not let his enemies get wind of the extend of his injuries. Mirella gets interviewed for the job but turned it down because she didn't want anything to do with the mafia.\n",
      "He offered money, status, just as long as she remains quiet and does her job. When he throws an enormous sum of money at Mirella to the job and she still refuses. He had to find a weakness to exploit. Mirella had always wanted to help take care of her mom ever since her dad left them for the mob. They agreed upon an amount with some going to mom. But she had to stay at his house. Fynn was a problematic client because he has a problem giving up control. He's domineering, savage and goregous. Mirella is beautiful, fiesty, funny and strong-willed and pushed every one of his buttons. He had never desire woman like that before. As they spend time together Mirella learn that what she thought about the Bruno family was not what it seems. The two succumb to their attraction it was smutty, raunchy, filthy and down right erotic. The push and pull between these characters and the power dynamics keep you the pages way past sunrise on this nail biting, decadent read. One day Mirella call her but Fynn forbade her from visiting her, mom told her that the man she resented all this time was not her dad. On her way back to to Fynn she ended getting abducted by Cillian, who is Bruno family enemies who wanted to use her as a pawn in the war. He wants her to be his spy or else her mother will suffer the consequences. What will Mirella do? Will she tell Fynn what she find out? The story was undeniably addictive and beautifully written with passionate characters. The story was revenge driven.\n",

      "When Keris Stainton first told me about And By the Way... for D&B Week, I didn't know what to expect. It sounded really good, but I hadn't heard of Denise Deegan before. I have to say, I judged the book by it's cover. When I opened it's pages, I was looking forward to what I expected would be a fluffy read, despite the topic. It's anything but fluffy. But it's completely fantastic!\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't even really know where to begin. Alex is suffering terribly from the death of her mother six months ago. Her Dad pretty much acts like she doesn't exist, and she feels so alone. She has her friends, but is so absolutely terrified of losing anyone else that she holds back from people. She doesn't share what she's feeling, she'll avoid socialising outside school. It's so difficult to read, because she is so unbelievably lost. There was a moment where I almost burst into tears on a bus. I'm not like Alex, nor is my Mum like Alex's, but they had the same kind of close, fun relationship I have with my Mum, and it just really hit home how devastated it is. She keeps herself behind think concrete walls and won't let anyone inside. Until David starts showing an interest, and just won't leave her alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not going to say any more than that about the plot, I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but it's just brilliant. The book almost seems to be split up into several parts - the main one being before X and after X (and no, I won't tell you what X is). Yet there are several over ways you could break the story down, because so much happens. This book is about so much more than just Alex coping with her mother's death. Almost every important character in this book is dealing with some sort of problem. Relationship issues, family issues, self-esteem issues, loss in other ways. As I said, there's a lot going on, and it's terribly sad. I didn't cry while reading this novel, but that's simply because I way beyond crying. It was too sad to cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I love is how we get to see several other people effected by grief, too - namely 'The Rockstar' and Alex's Gran. Her Dad doesn't function on anything other than work. That is his life now. Alex thinks it's because he just doesn't care, but it's the only way he's able to deal with things - though he doesn't realise how he's treating Alex. Gran stays at home all day with the curtains drawn. Alex is the only person she sees. It's only through hearing about Alex's life that she gets back her old spark back. It's all really sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is one character in this book who, initially, I would quite like to beat to a pulp. However, as the book goes on we see more of his nicer side show. He doesn't really have much page time, but I found him to be quite interesting, a \"more than meets the eye\" character. I know this series is about the three friends, but I'd so love to see him with his own book!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to end this review with an anecdote. I was talking to my Mum about the book, how sad it was and how awful all the things that were happening were, and went to get myself some chocolate for comfort eating...\n",

      "When most non-Irish people think of Irish people they think of alcohol, leprachauns, and more alcohol. So when an Irish book comes out it's hard to be optimistic. But as a (sometimes) proud Irish girl, I am so honoured to be from the same country as the setting of this book! I loved this book so fucking much. You get drawn into the story, begin to love the characters, and cry with them along the way. Definitely one of the best things to come from Irish soil. Go you, Denise Deegan! You've made our country awesome again! :)\n",

      "I already knew I would love this book from the first page. It grabbed your attention and gave you a \"Yeah, tell me about it\" feeling whenever she talked.\n",
      "\n",
      "It tells the story of Alex, a girl who's still recovering from the sudden death of her mother, and dealing with having her famous \"Rockstar\" father drift slowly away from her grasp. She finds comfort in David, a boy who understands her pain, and her two best friends, Sarah and Rachel (who each get a sequel with their POV).\n",
      "\n",
      "Alex is a very complicated character. She doesn't want to get close to anybody ever since her mum died as she doesn't want go through the pain if something bad happens to them. This is what makes her romance with David so intriguing. He knows what she's going through, and wants to help, but she continually refuses. But he won't take no for an answer, and eventually Alex stops refusing. The connection between them feels genuine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her relationship with her dad is even more complex. He starts ignoring her ever since her mum died, but we start to see their relationship evolve throughout the book and Deegan makes it happen so naturally. It's not like on one page they hate each other and on the other Alex suddenly realises how much she needs her dad kind-of-way.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has a crap load of stuff to deal with throughout the book, and you can't help but cheer as she begins to deal with it all and start to move past the mind-boggling grief and realise its okay to not be sad all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though I (thankfully) haven't dealt with losing the death of dear close family member besides grandparents, I could totally believe how Alex felt when she felt she was being swallowed up by grief. It makes me wonder whether the author actually experienced that sort of grief, or was she that good of an author?\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is recommended to anybody, teen or adult, and so would (with Alex's friend Sarah's POV). I haven't read yet (Rachel's POV) but I know that will also be great and am looking forward to it. :)\n",

      "Meinung:\n",
      "Mir hat der Schreibstil von Denise Deegan richtig gut gefallen! Sie schreibt nicht um den heißen Brei herum, sondern geht gleich in die Offensive.\n",
      "Das ganze Buch ist aus der Sicht von Alex geschrieben, so dass man sich wunderbar in ihre Gefühle und Gedanken zurecht finden kann.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alex ist ein schwieriger Charakter. Sie hat vor ein paar Monaten ihre Mutter und gerade diese Trauer spürt man deutlich, wenn man dieses Buch liest. Es wirkt so real!\n",
      "Durch die Trauer ist sie sehr verschlossen und lässt keine Nähe mehr zu. Auch nicht von ihren Freundinnen!\n",
      "Zu ihrem Vater hat sie seit dem Tod ihrer Mutter eigentlich gar kein gutes Verhältnis mehr. Einzig Homer, ihr goldener Retriever, ist immer in ihrer Nähe, diese sie auch zulässt.\n",
      "\n",
      "In David habe ich mich sofort verliebt. Er ist einfach so toll! Er weiß genau, wie Alex sich fühlt, denn er hat sechs Monate zuvor das selbe durchlebt!\n",
      "David legt die Geduld an den Tag, die ich in manchen Situationen gar nicht aufbringen könnte. Er ist immer für Alex da, wenn sie ihn braucht. Und das, wo er mit seinen eigenen Problemen zu kämpfen hat!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mark, Alex Bodyguard und Chauffeur, und Rachel, ihre beste Freundin haben mir super gefallen.\n",
      "Sarah, ebenfalls eine gute Freundin von Alex, war zwar nett, aber ich kam nicht ganz mit ihrer Art klar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Auf dieses Buch bin ich mal zufällig bei Thalia gestoßen und wollte es dann unbedingt mitnehmen, weil es sich so interessant angehört hat.\n",
      "Ich habe mir eine schöne, aber auch traurige Liebesgeschichte vorgestellt. Und die habe ich auch bekommen!\n",
      "\n",
      "Die Geschichte von Alex und David beginnt im Buch schon relativ früh, doch ich finde, dass das überhaupt nichts macht. Es passt einfach super zum Buch.\n",
      "Was mir an diesem Buch besonders gefallen hat, dass es hier nicht nur um die Liebesgeschichte geht. Es geht um so viel mehr!\n",
      "Wie man mit der Trauer eines geliebten Menschen umgeht, um tägliche Probleme mit dem anderen Elternteil, Trennungen. Eigentlich all das, was das wahre Leben zu bieten hat!\n",
      "Und so finde ich, wirkt das alles nochmal realistischer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Das Buch hat es echt in sich! Als ich ¾ dieses Buches gelesen habe, wollte ich zum Schluss gar nicht mehr aufhören, weil es einfach soooo spannend wurde!\n",
      "\n",
      "Das Ende ist wirklich offen und richtig zufrieden hat es mich nicht gestellt. Wie denn auch, wenn ich als weiterlesen könnte? Ich bin jetzt schon gespannt, wie es in Teil 2 mit Sarah weitergeht!\n",
      "\n",
      "Fazit:\n",
      "''Wer braucht schon Liebe'' von Denise Deegan ist ein gelungener Auftakt der ''Butterfly'-Trilogie. Dieses Buch beinhaltet nicht nur eine tolle Liebesgeschichte, sondern befasst sich auch mit dem Tod, Familie und Freundschaft.\n",
      "Wer Simone Elkeles, Huntley Fitzpatrik und Kody Keplinger geliebt hat, der wird auch dieses Buch lieben!\n",

The last person I'm going to listen to is David McFadden. When he calls me Ice Queen, I'll show him just how right he is.\n",

      "Much to my surprise I quite enjoyed this novel, despite a very unsatisfactory ending. The premise is a simple one. Six people head off on a dig to Greenland in the artic summer. They go to a very isolated spot where there were viking settlements which disappeared (plague or massacre, we are never entirely certain). The six are a varied and suitably irritating bunch, one of whom is a complete novice (a literature student doing a thesis). They have limited contact with the outside world and are there for the brief summer with enough food (unappetising) to last them. The leader is an obsessive with very clear rules about how the dig should be run. The literature student appears neurotic and starts to see/hear the ghosts of previous residents who do not like the graves being disturbed. Towards the end it seems she is probably more sane and realistic than the rest. In the background as they leave a flu pandemic appears to be starting.\n",
      "We hear from each of the characters in letter form (some a lot more than the others). The letter idea works ok. Each of the characters is annoying in their own way and are a pretty typical bunch for this sort of story.\n",
      "There is a good deal of detail about the environment they are in (not surprising as the author has written a good deal about polar exploration) and about food; real and imagined, as they become more hungry (again not surprising as the author has also written about food in literature). There were some interesting literary links (Villette for instance) with nineteenth century literature and some parallels with the books mentioned in the story.\n",
      "All this was good fun, not especially creepy; however the ending was a definite let down. This may be because it wasn't long enough and could have been fleshed out.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I’ve now read Moss’s complete works (well, her five novels and travel book at least; not the more academic stuff), just in time for her new novella coming out in September (Ghost Wall). This was her first book, and it’s really good, a suspenseful story of six people on an archaeological dig in West Greenland: three men and three women, all English or American academic types looking for distraction at a time when the world is under threat from a distressing epidemic. From the day they arrive, they are completely cut off, and not just physically; an unreliable Internet connection means they’re largely out of touch with the world and don’t know the progress of the plague.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the book is narrated by three of the main characters – Nina, Ruth and Jim – though brief sections towards the end cycle through the other three as well. All of the characters address their narratives to a certain ‘you’, which in some cases is a partner or a family member but in others is just a nameless future reader. If the worst arrives, they want to be remembered. It was a wise choice for Moss to start with Nina, a literature student who’s here because of her interest in how Old Norse sagas influenced Victorian poetry. Her voice stands out because she is remarkably blunt for an English person. When she starts having nightmares about violence that occurred on this site centuries ago and hears mysterious movement and noises in the night, you as the reader are more inclined to believe her because she is such a no-nonsense character. As they unearth a burial ground, it seems hard to see these incidents as anything other than the interventions of angry ghosts.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, this is a dystopian vision, a survival tale, and a ghost story all in one. It blends history and a believable near future in an effective way, but what I admired most was the characterization. With their disparate losses, fears and goals, these are rounded characters you care about. I didn’t always think the epidemic was necessary background – the Greenland setting is enough to account for their isolation and worry – but it adds to the general aura of peril, which Moss sustains all the way up to the last chapter.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Cold Earth centres on six graduate students gathered together on an archaeological dig but Sarah Moss uses their story to explore wider themes of grief, loss, faith, human fallibility and frailty. It’s a tense, atmospheric piece, set in an isolated area of Greenland, home to the remains of a medieval settlement that disappeared for reasons that are uncertain. The team’s experiences are told from overlapping perspectives but the dominant voice is Nina’s. She’s working on a thesis about the influence of Norse sagas on nineteenth-century literature, making her connection to excavating the villagers’ remains tangential, yet every night in her dreams she sees them, so vivid they’re almost tangible. Gradually she finds it impossible to tell what’s real and what imagined, at night in her tent she claims to hear the voices of the dead whisper in the air, and the others start to wonder if she’s entirely well. As news of a global pandemic reaches the camp, contact with the outside starts to dry up. Anxiety mounts as supplies run low and each confronts their deepest, most fundamental fears, all the ways in which their worlds might fail from nuclear threat to the looming impact of climate change; fears intensified by speculations on what may have destroyed the former colony they’re here to document.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moss’s focus on a small group stranded in a remote location, beset by possible supernatural forces reminded me of books like Michelle Paver’s but Moss seems less interested in exploring the boundaries between reality and the supernatural. Instead she seems more invested in presenting her characters’ attitudes to their increasingly fraught situation as an example of how beliefs may fuel or derail the drive for survival in extreme circumstances, love, religion, superstition, a reliance on the rational or scientific. This was Moss’s debut novel and it shows at times, there are some awkward passages and a tendency to tackle more than the narrative can fully support. But despite its weaknesses, this is absorbing and well-observed: an intelligent variation on a traditional ghost story that raises interesting questions about the precarious, fragile nature of existence and the resources we take for granted.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Although Moss's debut novel was the last of her seven (published so far) that I read, it just might be my favorite of them all (although TBH, there isn't a dud in the bunch). Not sure what distinguished this for me from the rest, but I found it compulsively readable, and raced through it faster than the others. Of her other oeuvre, it resembles Ghost Wall most, as both center around explorations of past civilizations that take a turn for the worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "My major quibble is that the conceit of the book, supposedly composed of writings home by six stranded archeological students in Greenland facing an uncertain future and probable death. doesn't really bear close scrutiny - not only couldn't/wouldn't they have written in such detail (including pages of 'remembered' dialogue), but as in most books with multiple POVs, the writing all sounds the same, although the writers come from different backgrounds and experiences. Be that as it may, I found it compelling, exciting, and - although some would say this is damning with faint praise - I think it would make a kickass film. Will be eagerly awaiting whatever Moss produces next, and will move on to her non-fiction memoir of her year in Iceland, .\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Ahahahahahahaha! OK, this book isn't supposed to be funny but it's only for the fact that I laughed through most of it (albeit when I wasn't supposed to) that it gets 3 stars and not one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh dear, oh dear. Plot idea = great. Execution = erm, not. When I first read the blurb on the back of this I really thought I was in for a treat. Six archaelogoists on a dig in Greenland and then they get news of an epidemic back home and their communication with the outside world falls away and they are left stranded with not enough food or shelter. The book is written in the form of last letters home by each member of the party in turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what happened? Very little, as it goes. Each character was so underdeveloped I didn't give a monkeys about any of them, the \"inbetween plot\" of ghosties and ghoulies haunting their little camp was hilarious and not in any particular order that I could fathom and there were so many academic \"in-jokes\" that had me groaning on almost a page-by-page basis. I know this book was written by a senior literature professor, but seriously love, stick to your day job. Frankly most of the narrative left me appalled by its stiltedness and the oodles of references to 19th century classics only served to show off the authors knowledge than to enhance the plot in any way. Why did we need to know what picture was on the cover of Villette and Middlemarch? I sort of got the impression that alot of the authors own opinions were coming through her characters (imparticular Nina): there were left-wing views, snobbery about package holidays, views on femenism and all that had no relevence to the plot.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my favourtie parts was when the group had realised that they had had no internet connection for several days. They were wondering if maybe the epidemic had spread from the USA to Europe. So instead of testing a website in, say, Australia or Malaysia what do they do? Check a real-estates in Scotland and the Guardian Newspaper, that's what. Genius!\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the 3 stars - I laughed. I laughed a lot. And, weirdly, I felt compelled to keep reading. Did I enjoy this book? Yes, sort of. Would I recommend it? No.\n",

      "I totally love any of the books in Mina Carters Warriors of the Lathar and Lathar Mercenaries series. These books are automatic one-clicks for me. The women in these series are strong. If they don't start out that way they certainly become that way. The men are hot. They love their women and are totally dedicated to them. The stories are well written and flow nicely. There are few if any typos. Sometimes the British colloquialisms throw me for a loop. The characters are all very different and there's no mistaking one for the other. They don't merge into one in my mind. Locations and scenes are described so that you can easily picture them in your mind. Each book has it's own HEA for the main couple but there's always a little something that let's you know that there will be another book to follow. I just wish that the stories were a little longer.\n",

      "The promotion of this book is about what a stellar light the author is as a founder of the Women's March - but it isn't mentioned that she (and two others) were from the Board amid accusations of anti-Semitism which was in part because of their close association with founder of the Nation of Islam,\n",

You can look them all up. Bob Bland actually tweeted that the white supremacist New Zealand massacre was the work of American Jews. She says she was being hassled by her toddlers when she posted it.

      "\n",
      "So We Are Not Here to Be Bystanders is Linda Sarsour's memoir. She recalls her childhood in Brooklyn, the beginning of her activism, and the Women's March. It's a memoir but it's also very much about speaking up and being yourself in a world that might not accept you. It's a powerful book, engaging and well written. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to split this review into topics because I realized I'm just all over the place when it comes to this book's content. In short, to use Sarsour's style (\"Brooklyn-Palestinian-American-Muslim\"), as a liberal Israeli American-ish Zionist Jew, I don't know how to feel about this. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The heart of this book is her activism and what she's doing is so necessary and so important. Hearing about her work with Muslim immigrants or the marches that she helped organize with BLM was really empowering and interesting. The way her message comes across in her book seems so important and relevant. A lot of what I know about her comes from media talking about her so it was very cool to suddenly see how amazing her work with refugees has been.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had no idea how deep and awful the American prejudice towards Muslims was after 9/11. Sarsour describes things like FBI suddenly making people disappear, for no reason or surveillance in Muslim neighborhoods. Even if we take her work with a grain of salt, it's definitely sad to hear about and my heart hurts for every innocent person who suffered because of 9/11.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Basing myself just on this book, there was something so so problematic about the way Sarsour address the claim that she has said antisemitic things.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I see it, we all grow up with various prejudices. This world still is far from being perfect and there are so many harmful notions that we end up being taught. I think those of us that are concerned about making the world a better place should always look inside and listen to others. Our intersectional activism requires us to be ready to listen and learn. \n",

      "So when Jews tell Linda Sarsour that she's being antisemitic and her response is to go, \"I'm not antisemitic, I have Jewish friends\", it sounds exactly like every person who's ever said, \"I'm not racist, I have Black friends\". She doesn't pause to acknowledge that maybe Jews can tell when someone's being antisemitic or that JVP are hardly representatives of Judaism.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had read this book because I hoped to hear an explanation. She starts this book by doing a beautiful job at explaining what she meant when she spoke about jihad and yet, her acknowledgement of antisemitism is pretty much non-existent. Just as her comments about jihad were taken out of context, I had hoped to see the same for antisemitism but nope. \n",
      "\n",
      "This problem is even bigger because this is a massive problem across the Israeli-Palestinian discourse and broadly speaking, the American left. As an American, I am so here for Democrats but as an Israeli and as a Jew, it feels like there's never any type of awareness about Jews as a minority and Jewish persecution. She does so much beautiful work in uniting Americans together and it's frustrating that Jews for her only exist as a way to refute claims about antisemitism.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an Israeli, I check myself thousands of times about Islamophobia and Arab racism because I realize those things slip into our discourse and I don't want them to. I still feel like there's so much to learn. It's embarrassing and shameful that Sarsour, as a Palestinian American Muslim, does not do the same. Exactly because of her heritage, if she cares about her intersections, she should dig deep into the history of Muslim antisemitism and make sure that when she speaks up against Israel, her discourse doesn't also include antisemitism. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "I kind of hoped to see any type of comment about feminism in Muslim societies. I mean, Sarsour talks about how her upbringing was different from other people's (like her father was happy that his first born was a woman) and she takes care to point out that every religious thing she did was her choice, from an assigned marriage to the hijab. It was really nice to see, especially because that's a topic that gets so much negative attention. \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I was missing a conversation about how she feels about the sexism within the culture. Does she struggle with it? Has it always been easy for her to break out of the sexist norms and combine her feminism with her culture and religion? Does she see her experience as the majority or the minority? Her voice about this would have been really interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a minor point, her claim about how feminism needs to also speak for Palestinian women is very empty and misleading. I mean, does feminism need to speak for all women? Absolutely. That also includes Zionist women, doesn't it? I could just as easily say, \"you're not a feminist if you don't speak for Zionist women\". It's irritating because it's like she's not saying anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her claim about how you can't be a feminist and a Zionist is just ridiculous. I've gotten the impression that often people use the word Zionist because they have realized it's not politically correct to use the word Jew but ultimately, all Zionism really has ever meant is the desire for Jews to have a country. It doesn't say anything about borders or Palestinians. One state for everyone can entirely be a Zionist vision so it's just irritating that she takes the feminist cause and turns it into something that it's not. We should empower Palestinian women and Israeli women in our search for peace (and there's an actual organization that does this- Women For Peace).\n",

      "In many ways, Linda Sarsour and I have led very similar childhoods. We both grew up speaking a Semitic language at home and English at school, we both have parents who moved to the United States in search of better opportunities, we both spent summers here in Israel-Palestine. I think Linda Sarsour and I would find we have a lot of similar childhood memories. \n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, Sarsour's parents taught her Arabic so that she would be able to communicate with relatives- mine taught me Hebrew so that I would be able to live here. My parents taught me that we would return. And now, I no longer feel comfortable hyphenating myself as an American-Israeli because I feel more Israeli while Sarsour continues to stress both of them in pretty much every speech. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think these differences are crucial. Would Sarsour come back here if she could? If tomorrow Palestine would be an independent country, would she leave her life in America and move to a country that is essentially foreign to her? \n",
      "\n",
      "In some ways, when she continues to mention her Palestinian heritage, it feels like it's just that- heritage. She mentions the importance of the right of return but would she return? When she attempts to speak for Palestinians by stressing her heritage, it's odd because her Palestinian-ness is a reflection of ethnicity rather than nationality, isn't it?\n",
      "\n",
      "When she talks about solutions, it doesn't matter to her where the border would cross or what the government would look like because it's not her life that would change radically based of this, even if she has family here. I realize this is the case for every international politics conversation and of course, you don't need to be personally impacted by a topic in order to stand up for justice but by mentioning her heritage, it comes across as if this is a matter that has severe implications for her and I just don't understand how she claim this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to conclude by saying that I found myself watching interviews with her (dang, her Brooklyn accent is so prominent) and I was somewhat shocked by the amount of hateful and racist comments. I mean, I'd say that perhaps her activism about the conflict is misguided but between that and saying she advocates for sharia law is quite a big gap and it's awful how quickly people cross into pure hate. It shows how necessary it is that she does speak up.\n",
      "\n",
      "To sum up, is interesting. I think it could have delved deeper into certain topics, as it leaves them unanswered. I'm glad I read it because it provided insight into the American left. As a whole, if you're interested in more information about who Linda Sarsour is, this book is probably a good place to start.\n",

      "Sarsour’s book is a prime example of why history matters. It’s not just the events themselves, it’s not the date, place, or time. It’s the people that were and continue to be affected. By taking us through personal narratives, Sarsour is able to contextualize and explain the significance of a transformative period in history—one that continues to have lasting impacts. Beyond diving into the harmful effects of 9/11, Sarsour also shares insights on what it takes to organize a movement. While I wish she would have spent more time explaining the barriers she faced as an outspoken Muslim woman in a patriarchal community, she did touch upon the struggles she faced as a mother in this field, something I had never considered. I also appreciate her explaining why she chose to wear the hijab, and what it meant to be a visible Muslim. I think those conversations are important to explain the complexity of the hijab to those who may be unfamiliar with the concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a person for the people, but it’s easier for me to be reactive to injustice than it is for me to think about educating the ignorant. This book helped revive my faith, my spirit, and passion to be loud for our communities that often go unheard. While I may not agree with the significance she placed on the Women’s March (claiming it was the precursor to the political outcry after Trump’s election), learning about the organizing efforts that went behind the movement did show me how having these difficult conversations with a handful of individuals can eventually spread. She didn’t dismiss an opportunity to educate because the payout would be “too small” which is something I’ve often thought about in social justice work—focusing on systemic change because of a larger payout than focusing on changing laymen (a much more difficult, an often unwaverable task). But she showed the power of the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciate that the book focused on the political issues more than it did her individual efforts, but I do want to thank her for her resilience. And for being strong enough to realize and act upon the fact that as Muslims, our actions reflect the community, not just the individual. If she chose to express her frustrations differently, we wouldn’t have been able to progress.\n",

      "It's safe to say that I am a big fan of the new Doctor Who, and I have been ever since it arrived in 2005, back when I was sixteen. I wasn't a big fan from the first episode. As a science-fiction fan in general, I had heard of Doctor Who but was not quite sure what it was all about. So I tuned into the CBC and watched \"Rose\" with interest. Gradually, I came to appreciate Doctor Who for what it is: one of the best TV shows ever.\n",

      "Normally I don't like to jump on the \"we have it so good these days\" bandwagon, but … we do. We Canadians might grumble about licensing restrictions preventing us from watching some videos online, but at least we're lucky enough to see regularly (and now that it's on Space, it's even on a channel that doesn't pre-empt it for hockey!). From the essays in , I get the impression that the life of an American fan involved scrabbling around for video cassettes (which were not always cheap or easy to find) and negotiating with parents/siblings/broadcasters to ensure they had access to their regular dose of . the episodes seems to have been an epic struggle in and of itself; I am lucky enough to get them delivered directly to my TV or computer whenever I like.\n",

      "I've never really seen the old , and this doesn't bother me. I don't feel like I'm missing out, because unlike the essayists here, those Doctors weren't my Doctors. The division between the series is sharp enough that I don't feel the loss, and because I was not around when the old series was broadcast, because I never attended conventions or got involved in the fan groups, I don't have that sense of community that this book so clearly portrays. While I wouldn't mind watching episodes of the old , they are not as essential to me as they are to so many of the contributors to . So for that reason, I really enjoyed hearing their perspectives on the old series and how it affected their childhood. I liked hearing about their favourite Doctors and companions, and especially their anecdotes about attending conventions; working on the shows, the audio books, or the tie-in novels; and becoming a part of the larger community.\n",

Thomas' daughter, Caitlin, has , and toward the end of her essay Thomas talks about how fans and members of the community have provided assistance and support. It's at this point in the book that I stopped devouring the essays and had to force myself to slow down, because it was difficult to read so quickly while my eyes were tearing up. This is where went from being interesting and insightful to beautiful.\n",

Ironically, a week later I received access to an electronic copy in the Hugo Voters Packet, because is nominated in the \"Best Related Work\" category (and I will most likely be voting for it). I shall keep my print copy, because the electronic version is a yucky PDF. And I'm glad to have paid for it.

Many of the essays have more serious moments, and all reveal what it's like to be a woman fan, to go to conventions, to cosplay, to make -inspired fan videos or write fan-fiction. The essays herein provide insight into a part of fandom I have never seen, not only because of my gender but also simply because I don't go to conventions, and I neither read nor write fan-fiction. I exist on the periphery of the community, and this was like getting an all-access pass. To be certain, some of the essays are encomia of the show and its fan base. Some verge upon the academic—in particular, Shoshana Magnet and Robert Smith? write about the problematic portrayal of women in the new series' companions in \"Two Steps Forward, One Step Back: Have We Really Come That Far?\".

Some are positive, some not so much. But Thomas and O'Shea have managed to collect a broad spectrum of opinions and experiences from across the community of female fans and compile them into a single, amazing volume. For fans, I'd call this essential reading. Even if you aren't a fan of , you still might like this: if fandom and its phenomena interest you, or if as a feminist or sociologist you're interested in women's perspective on women in one of the longest-lived science-fiction fan communities, then grab a copy of .\n",

      "This is a fun look at fandom from a female persepctive. Like several of the essayists in this collection, I was a late convert to the bliss that is Doctor Who. (MANY thanks to my friend Kim who INSISTED that I watch it and then Torchwood) My two favorite essays are by Elizabeth Bear and Carole Barrowman. (big sister of John Barrowman- aka- Captain Jack Yumminess, er, Harkness)The various aspects of fandom (watching, writing, costuming, etc) are well represented in this slim volume and I would recommend it to anyone, male or female, who loves Doctor Who or someone who does.\n",

      "In someways I was at a disadvantage going into the essays. At the launch panel they joked about many essays starting with the person discovering a strange man in a scarf on PBS. I came to the fandom long after I could have had that experience (for me Journey's End had already aired -- What? I'm a late inductee). I was never in the small group of women and a male dominated fandom, because I joined with the flood of female fans brought on by the new series. Many of the essays don't reflect my experience, but nevertheless, they do reflect my history, and as such were interesting and important to read.\n",

Dr. Who is far cooler than it's closest cultural equivalent, Star Trek, for at least two reasons: 1) bow ties, 2) its ability to appeal to a large, active, passionate, and devoted female viewership.\n",

      "Topics range from analyses of gender, sexual, and racial stereotypes (and the occasional breaking thereof) in the program, to in-depth explorations of the merits of individual (mostly female) characters. The book only drags in the essays on the history of fandom itself - there's only so much interest you can get from reading about someone else's convention-going experience. Otherwise, a nifty little book.\n",

      "Dark Desire (about 125 pgs.) is book one of eight in the serial short, Touched By You series, an Erotic Romance written by Emily Jane Trent. I read this as a R2R with Fifty Shades Support Group. As always, a special thank you to the mods and author for allowing me to participate.\n",

      "I was a bit disappointed with this read. The writing was well done and flowed beautifully, the sexual encounters were hot and very steamy but the similarities between this and the Fifty’s books was just TOO closely related. I love the Fifty’s books, as my user name can confirm, and I loved the Twilight Saga, so I was anxious to read this one. Being inspired by those two phenomenal series is commendable but at the same time the story needs to have its own originality instead of just replacing names and scenery.\n",

      "Natalie is an awkward, sometimes clumsy twenty two year old virgin whose naive and innocence attracts Tanner, the over protective, brooding and mysterious billionaire whose proclivities lean towards the darker side. Tanner likes to keep his personal life a secret and knowing he’s a troubled soul, he warns her to stay away. But she’s enthralled with him, so they both give into their desires and spend one beautiful night having “vanilla” sex. Natalie soon finds out her scholarship and the events in her life are all at the hands of Tanner’s controlling nature, but she just can’t stay away. Sound familiar? Even the sub-characters run similarly close to the Fifty’s books.\n",

      "I like this read for its well written qualities. I wanted to like the characters and the story and I did to an extent. I also think this has the beginnings of a great series but it needs some originality and riding the coattails of another book just doesn’t sit well with me. I see a lot of potential and hopefully in the next book and the others there after, the author slides away from the same theme and develops her own voice and story.\n",

      "I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review, so I am going to be brutally honest. There were parts of this book that I had issues with, such as the ever changing person to person perspective. One minute we are reading it from Natalie's POV, then Tanners and then on occasion Cheryl's, its just confusing, especially when these changes occur randomly throughout the chapter. I also couldn't relate to Natalie's character for about 75% of this book. I found her to be weak and suffering serious self esteem issues, such as the fact she clearly didn't feel she was worthy of Tanner! For me it was just a little too much and by the end I was screaming 'Get a Grip Girl' A little pet hate of mine is also calling a penis a 'Member', it just reminds me of some cheesy romance novel and this book was most definitely not a cheesy romance novel. In fact even though I had these issues with the book, I did in fact enjoy the story and I'm intrigued as to where Natalie and Tanner's journey will take them.\n",

      "I enjoyed reading this short story, I liked the writing style, the pace was good and it was very erotic. The problem for me was the lack of originality in the plot. I was very uncomfortable with the similarities with Fifty Shades -\n",
      "Billionaire control freak, obsessed with her safety, 22 yr old virgin, (plus he's angry when he discovers she's a virgin), she's clumsy but only around him, he's into bdsm, he likes to keep his sexual partners private, even her friendship support group is similar. And although the dialogue wasn't exactly the same, they were saying similar things to one another at certain points in the story - going into the bath after their first time, the washcloth....it was all just too similar for me.\n",
      "I know that lots of people are getting on the fifty shades bandwagon and I usually enjoy those stories when they include some of the elements that I enjoyed in Fifty Shades, but they do need to be a new story and for me this wasn't different enough. This is the start of an umpteen part series, so hopefully the story will start to diverge from Fifty Shades from this point onwards.\n",

      "Let's face it: phones, TikTok, Zoom meetings, hybrid working, you name it--it's all technology that's here to stay. It's unrealistic to think that people are really going to put their devices down in the office, in the classroom or at dinner. I struggle with this. We're all up against extreme odds in getting people to REALLY be present and pay attention to us, and at the same time, it's just so easy to be distracted by your own technology. I appreciate that Jeanine Turner points out that it's not an either/or proposition. She puts forward a number of ways we can optimize how, when, and where we communicate to optimize meaningful exchanges. It's all about choice and bringing intentionality to HOW we communicate with others. It's fluid: it can flex and change throughout the course of conversation. There might be times when you need to demand attention (entitled presence), although that often doesn't work so well, but sometimes it can, if it's for short durations. There are times when you have to calibrate how much you are interacting in a given moment (budgeted presence). And there are times when you can bring the other person actively into choosing how to communicate (invitational presence), among others.\n",

      "We are whole people bringing our whole selves to work, and play. It's important to be aware of how and when we communicate, especially because we are mostly mediated by technology at this point.

      "This is a fantastic book, with critical relevance for all facets of life. Turner’s call to understand and choose intentionally our social presence is a necessary and constant task, which (I think) most people don’t fully grasp. I appreciated how Turner doesn’t engage in ranking the types of presence or casting some in a negative light; each of the four types of social presence has a place in our daily life, but bringing awareness to them and learning to actively manage — or better, choose — social presence is a skill needed by each of us, daily.\n",

      "To solve a problem, you must understand the problem first. This book does a decent job of defining problems in communication due to technology.

      "Dieses Buch liest sich zwar relativ leicht, ist aber dennoch sehr tiefsinnig und emotional. Die Geschichte ist sehr schön, gefühlsbetont und nicht unbedingt als Lektüre für zwischendurch geeignet. Als Leser muss man sich auf das Buch einlassen, sich öffnen, fallenlassen und eintauchen. Es geht um Glaube, Liebe und Vergebung.\n",

      "I enjoy Sara Evans music. I hated this book. I don't know that I had expectations for it exactly, but I thought it would be better than this. However, I do think results may vary. If you're someone who watches every Hallmark Christmas movie on repeat, then you will probably like this better than me. If, however, you are like me and maybe try to watch 1 every season just to be reminded, yet again, why you hate Hallmark Christmas movies, then this definitely isn't the book for you.\n",

      "This cloyingly sweet story follows 2 timelines. The present day involves Jade and Max who are 5 weeks from getting married. Jade is torn on whether or not to invite her mother whom she hasn't spoken to in years. The past timeline follows Jade's parents through her birth and growing up years as we come to understand why their relationship is like it is. While the focus of the book is on mother/daughter relationships and recovering from past hurts, the romance with Jade and Max is also prominent. And it's awful. If there were ever two people on earth who shouldn't get married, it's Jade and Max - at least not without some serious individual therapy and couples counseling first. I'm confused by the story as to whether or not I was supposed to find them romantic, but as they supply the \"happy ending\", I'm thinking yes? Without giving away any details, I'll just say Jade could have made her wedding dress out of all the red flags and still had some left over.\n",

      "Why do we cry? How come love hurts? And what's a happiness researcher doing writing about sadness, anyway? Well, it turns out the two aren’t mutually exclusive. After eight years of investigating into happiness, Helen discovered a startling fact: most of us are terrified of being sad. So phobic, in fact, that we jeopardise our chances of truly living at all. This needs to change, because we need our sadness: it’s a message. It can tell us what’s wrong and what to do about it. Researchers have found that allowing for temporary sadness, counter-intuitively, makes us happier. And trying to avoid sadness – even to the extent many of us do on a daily basis – is detrimental to our mental health. So the time has come to get better at having difficult conversations. How To Be Sad is part memoir, part manifesto for change in how we express our emotions, good and bad. Exploring why we get sad; what makes us sad; how sadness can be a force for good; the truth about crying; why some of us get sadder than others; what we can do when we’re sad; and what we definitely shouldn’t do. Including the history of sadness, how other cultures handle theirs, the differences between sadness and depression, addiction, grief, heartbreak, burnout and everything in between.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russell interweaves personal testimony with the latest research on sadness from psychologists, psychiatrists, geneticists, neuroscientists and historians as well as the experiences of writers, comics, athletes and change-makers from both sides of the Atlantic. How To Be Sad includes interviews with former medic Adam Kay, Joshua Becker (Becoming Minimalist), Meik Wiking (The Happiness Research Institute), Ella Mills (Deliciously Ella), Jeremy Vine (BBC), journalists Matt Rudd (The Sunday Times) and John Crace (The Guardian), polar explorer Ben Saunders, Yomi Adegoke (The Black Girls Bible), comedian Robin Ince, Julia Samuel MBE (Grief Works) and Mungi Ngomane (Everyday Ubuntu). This is a fascinating, insightful and accessible read brimming with anecdotal evidence and cases to back up the author's claims. It explores how sadness is a vital part of life and discussion about this was much more thought-provoking than I had initially imagined it would be. It's an intriguing and well written book compiled by one of the most prominent scientists in her field and is published at a time when many are facing more sadness than they have ever felt before. How To Be Sad is a guide for anyone who has ever been sad. A book about how we can all get happier by learning to be sad, better. \n",

Here she faces sources of sadness in her life head-on: her younger sister’s death from SIDS and the silence that surrounded that loss; her parents’ divorce and her sense of being abandoned by her father; struggles with eating disorders and alcohol and exercise addiction; and relationship trials, from changing herself to please boyfriends to undergoing IVF with her husband, T (aka “Legoman”), and adjusting to life as a mother of three.\n",
      "\n",
      "As in her other self-help work, she interviews lots of experts and people who have gone through similar things to understand why we’re sad and what to do about it. I particularly appreciated chapters on “arrival fallacy” and “summit syndrome,” both of which refer to a feeling of letdown after we achieve what we think will make us happy, whether that be parenthood or the South Pole. Better to have intrinsic goals than external ones, Russell learns.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also considers cultural differences in how we approach sadness: for instance, Russians relish sadness and teach their children to do the same, whereas the English, especially men, are expected to bury their feelings. Russell notes a waning of the rituals that could help us cope with loss, and a rise in unhealthy coping mechanisms. Like Susan Cain does in , she also covers sad music (vs. one of her interviewees prescribing Jack Johnson as a mood equalizer). There are lots of laughs to be had, but the epilogue can’t fail to bring a tear to the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "A reread, though I only skimmed the first time around – my tiny points of criticism would be that the book is a tad long – the print in the paperback is really rather small – and retreads some of the same ground as (e.g., how exercise and culture can contribute to a sense of wellbeing). I read that just last year, after enjoying with my book club. She’s a reliable nonfiction author; I’d liken her to a funnier Gretchen Rubin.\n",

      "[Original review, based on a skim in July 2021: Russell has a fun, informal style. This would make a fine follow-up to . The premise is that we shouldn’t have to apologize for being sad, but can learn some techniques for alleviating depression. The book is about half memoir and the other half interviews/research/general information. Russell has had many causes of sadness in her life: her younger sister died of SIDS and her parents split; she’s suffered from eating disorders and infertility; she’s had bad break-ups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually she had three children (two of them twins via IVF), but, to her surprise, this didn’t mean that she had “arrived” and would never be unhappy again. For her postnatal depression she was offered drugs or therapy, still the go-to solutions. But, she found, other things could help, too: a good diet, exercise outdoors (especially cold-water swimming), being part of a buddy system, and helping others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other topics she covers include perfectionism, bullying, Victorian mourning culture, and happiness by country – a topic she’s written a whole book about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two bits that stood out for me: When she interviewed Henry Hitchings, he told her he thinks Brits are intolerant of sadness and expect people not to show their pain; people from other countries were more sympathetic when his mother died. I also noted that one-third of U.S. presidents lost a father when young.]\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "In this perfect Instagrammable life that we are supposed to be leading, there is no space for boredom or sadness. These things do not fit in the busy lives of influencers and celebrities and they expect us to follow their lead. Not only are we not allowed to be sad now, but people are scared of this emotion and seem to want to do every to protect themselves and their loved ones from experiencing it. Only the visible outpouring of grief for celebrities that we have never met seems to be acceptable forms of emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But being sad is just a normal emotion it shouldn’t be something that we push to one side in the hope that it will go away and we can carry on as before. In this book, Russell thinks that we should fully embrace it, learn what is happening to us when we are sad and the best ways of getting through it and out the other side. She has had plenty of time to be sad in her life, details of which she expands on in the book. Sometimes her sadness leads onto moments of depression and other illnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are lots of things out there to help us when we are suffering from moments of sadness the music to choose, the places to go, apps that can help when you are at your lowest ebb and the buddy system so you can have a person to lean on as and when you need it. There is even a recommendation for reading fiction when sad, and if you can’t bring yourself to pick up a book then an audiobook can have the same effect. Getting out of the home can be a big help too, either for a walk or if feeling particularly brave cold water swimming.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought that was a really well-considered and researched book that Russell has written about the subject of sadness. I feel that she is spot on with her conclusion that the pursuit of happiness and the perfect ‘Instagram’ life is causing so many problems, especially when people have those times in their lives that don’t conform to their expectations. Even though she has written this book to help you, it doesn’t feel like a self-help book. She is not preachy but guides with humour her experiences about how to be sad and how to get through it in a positive way. The advice is sensible and more importantly achievable and she details how that will help us to appreciate the happier times much more. Well worth reading. 4.5 stars.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I really enjoyed this book and its exploration of sadness. I felt like Russell was holding my hand and saying “absolutely nothing is wrong with you and your sadness is fine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t feel the blurb fully encompasses what to expect from this novel, as it is a part memoir as well as part exploration of the emotion sadness. She speaks to a range of researchers, people with lived experience and shares her own life story with us. These three components make for a digestible, comforting and informative read. Russell talks about what to do when you’re feeling sad, how to talk about being sad and sitting with yourself when being sad. Overall, she really advocates for simply accepting sadness will be a part of life and you do not need to battle it constantly, or constantly strive for happiness. And with the use of researchers, science, and her story I think she achieves her goal. This is a good self-help book for dealing with general ups and downs in life and I think the messages here are useful for everyone. There is a jam-packed reference section as well as a resource section that allows readers to go beyond her book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed the way Russell approached this, as well as her writing style and also appreciate that she speaks about seeking professional help for the other challenges in her life (that go beyond just being sad). She embraces the distinction between mental health conditions and plain sadness, urging readers to discover what’s right for them but working through their sadness. A book I’ll re-read and I can certainly say I’m a fan of this author!\n",

      "I've never put a cookbook on my goodreads profile before, but I actually did read this one cover-to-cover. I've had an Instant Pot for nearly two years but it felt intimidating so I left it in the cupboard. I've decided to give myself \"mini challenges\" each month in 2021, and for February, it's figuring out how to use the Instant Pot, and then use it once a week. Enter this book ...\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, if you're like me and have an Instant Pot but are scared of it, get this book! I read the whole introduction on how to use it, the different buttons, how to depressurize, everything. And this book really does cover it all - with lots of photos. It also shows different models of Instant Pots so you can recognize those buttons (which apparently vary slightly) on your model. The recipes not only include step-by-step instructions, but there are multiple photos of each recipe in the various stages, as well. The recipes also include helpful hints like, \"It's going to feel like theres a lot of spinach in there and it will come up to the brim of the pot, but don't worry-it cooks down to nothing!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After reading this book, I decided I was ready. I started with the \"Best Ever Pot Roast\" as the author said it was his most popular recipe. Early in the cooking process I unfortunately discovered a fatal flaw. MINE, not the book's. I had an Instant Pot MINI! The mini will not fit a 3 pound roast. However, I did manage to get the recipe to work with a smaller piece of meat and no carrots. LOL. There are tons of good, basic recipes in here. From hard boiled eggs and rice (so easy!), to soups, pastas, chicken, meat, even desserts. I have a few highlighted to try later this month. The author says himself that he's not a trained chef, just someone who fell in love with the ease of using his Instant Pot. So, the recipes aren't gourmet by any stretch, but they're good, basic recipes. I also have and it has a lot more recipes, many that look delicious, and impressive. But it doesn't have the introduction that The Step-by-Step book has, and not nearly as many photos. If you're a beginner, get this one. If you're more seasoned, get the other too. They're both really good, but this one helped me overcome my intimidation of pressure cooking. The recipes are not going to blow you away, but they're basic, weeknight cooking type meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, my pro tip - do not buy an Instant Pot Mini at all unless you're obsessed with Instant Pot cooking and want to use it for side dishes, traveling (it's apparently portable, but it's still really big!) or cooking for two. This cookbook doesn't really have recipes for two, but that's fine by me. I'm going to ditch my mini anyway!\n",

      "\n",
      "The bad... the two recipes I tried- beef short ribs (Asian style) and chicken and broccoli (also Asian style) were good, but not great. The flavors weren’t as intense as I expected and the liquid was by far way too much even with the cornstarch slurries (both recipes had them). I feel like it decreased the flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have always been a big slow cooker fan and I was curious as to how the instant pot would be as far as taste and ease... so far, I can say that the slow cooker is still my favorite as far as ease, hands down. The instant pot is great as far as time constraints- I made a chicken noodle soup (recipe from a friend) in less than an hour that was fantastic!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a feeling I will come back to this recipe book once I get more confident in my instant pot skills because I believe, once tweaked a bit, there are some recipe keepers here. Overall, I’m happy with the instruction and still have much to explore with this book.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Amazing and imaginative\n",
      "\n",
      "I finally broke down and bought an Instant Pot. While I knew that this tool combines a pressure cooker, a slow cooker, and a sauté pan in one, I simply had no idea how versatile it can be. I just wanted to retire 3 slow cookers, an ancient pressure cooker, and the rice cooker to make some room in the kitchen. Jeff Eisner shows how to make dozens of exotic and old favorite dishes, from appetizers to desserts, using this invention. Every step is carefully described and illustrated in color photos. I expect to add some new meals to our repertoire of favorites and also to adapt some of the old ones.\n",

      "Brothers and Sisters of Byland Crescent by Bill Kitson is the beginning of The Cowgill Family Saga. It is a touching family saga that follows the life of Albert Cowgill who is determined to escape his humble beginnings. We follow Albert has he works his way up in a wool company, marries, and starts a family. We get to meet Albert’s colleagues, neighbors, and children. When the children grow up, they marry, and have children of their own. It is a realistic story that includes life’s ups and downs. The author captured the Great War with the battles and what the people involved endured (soldiers and nurses for example). So many families were forever changed by their losses. The author did not shy away from difficult subjects. He also added characters that you would not normally find in a historical saga. Brothers and Sisters of Byland Crescent is an emotional novel. It was interesting to learn about the wool trade and see how it changed with the industrial revolution. The book follows the Cowgill family from 1878 through 1922. This is a story that will keep you riveted once you get into it. It is a little bit of a slow starter, but I soon found myself engrossed. I had a tough time putting it down (the dog insisted on going for his walk). I liked the author’s writing style. It made for an engaging and easy to read historical novel. Brothers and Sisters of Byland Crescent moved along at a good pace. I am eager to read the next installment in The Cowgill Family Saga. Brothers and Sisters of Byland Crescent is a dramatic saga with an ambitious Albert, the helpful Hannah, a bustling business, a fine family, a waging war, a smarmy snake in the grass, and a startling surprise.\n",

Love that it is set in Yorkshire - brings to life the world at the turn of the century and during the First World War focussing on family and family business as the core. If you like this, you will be pleased it is the first of a trilogy.\n",

      "I do love a family saga and this is one of the best!\n",
      "Right from the very beginning, I felt at home with the Cowgill family. This first novel sets the scene for their background, ambitions and place in the world. While it is set before and during the first world war, such details are only covered as in how they affect the family. Having read Bill Kitson's novels previously, I knew this would be well written but it was more that that; it was one of 'those' novels - you know the type - where there is always something happening where you just HAVE to find out what happens next and end up reading far longer than you intended! Unusually for me, I couldn't leave this family alone and went on to read the second and third books in quick succession. A truly wonderful family saga and one with plenty going on to keep you fixed and entertained. I couldn't fault this, therefore five stars is the only way to go. Definitely recommended.\n",

A Gothic western, infested with vampires, and set in Louisiana seemed to me the perfect mental vacation spot. Robert McCammon hasn’t added anything new to the Vampire Legends with this book, but he created a character I wouldn’t mind experiencing a few more adventures with. Besides I can sleep on the moldy bed since he is sleeping in the moldy closet.\n",

      "Robert McCammon has been one of my favorite authors for many years now. His novel \"Boy's Life\" is one of my favorite books of all time. His older works of horror like \"Swan Song\" or \"They Thirst\" were outstanding and they made me a life-long fan. Then came his historical fiction series which is flat out awesome.

It seems that Trevor Lawson has some abilities that cause him to be special, but I won't tell you what they are. You will have to read this and find out for yourself.\n",

      "Even though this story is set in New Orleans and the nearby swamps, it has a western feel to it. At one point Trevor stops at a bar called the Swamp Root to ask directions and comes upon a card game.

      "McCammon writes: \"That was like a summons to Trevor Lawson who sipped at his whiskey and brought up his predator's smile...\" as he moves in closer to watch the poker game. It's easy to picture this scene as a western movie-the Swamp Root even has batwing doors.\n",

      "The third and final volume of Norwich's trilogy on the Byzantine civilization carries the empire through the Crusades, the rise of the Ottoman threat, and the disintegration - through internal miscalculation and external apathy - of the culture that kept Greek and Roman influence alive throughout the Dark Ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Standing as a bulwark against the ravaging hordes of the East, she provided safe passage for resentful religious armies intent on \"liberating\" Jerusalem, came frequently to the negotiating table in an attempt to heal her rift with the Latin papacy, and succumbed to the role of your basic marketing hockey puck through centuries of ruthless full-body checks between the shipping magnates of Venice and Genoa.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the sad years, rife with ineffectual leadership and short-term solutions, sacrifice and loss. Norwich catalogues it all, and honors this titanic kingdom in full as it fades forever from view.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Sometimes history reads like a tragedy, and the story of the final centuries of the Byzantine Empire is one of those times. Yet there is a certain beauty in tragedy, and that’s present too, perhaps best exemplified when Emperor Constantine XI removes his imperial regalia and charges into a hoard of enemy Turks as the city of Constantinople falls, the emperor never to be found and the city never to be redeemed.\n",
      "\n",
      "John Julius Norwich does his own sum-up best: “The Roman Empire of the East was founded by Constantine the Great on Monday, 11 May 330; it came to an end on Tuesday, 29 May 1453. . . . Byzantium may not have lived up to its highest ideals—what does?—but it certainly did not deserve the reputation which, thanks largely to Edward Gibbon, it acquired in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century in England: that of an Empire constituting, ‘without a single exception, the most thoroughly base and despicable form that civilization has yet assumed.’ So grotesque view ignores the fact that the Byzantines were a deeply religious society in which illiteracy—at least among the middle and upper classes—was virtually unknown, and in which one Emperor after another was renowned for his scholarship. . . . It ignores, too, the immeasurable cultural debt that the Western world owes to a civilization which alone preserved much of the heritage of Greek and Latin antiquity, during these dark centuries when the lights of learning in the West were almost extinguished. . . . Robert Byron maintained that the greatness of Byzantium lay in what he described as ‘the Triple Fusion:’ that of a Roman body, a Greek mind, and an oriental, mystical soul.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed Norwich’s writing style and appreciated his distinction between facts, suppositions, theories, and legends. Well worth reading for anyone who enjoys history.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This, the final volume of a three book series, brings to end a rivetting and excellent history of the Byzantium Empire. I cannot add anything to the other reviews and comments on this series other than to say if your enjoy reading about history you should love these accounts of this Empire and its times. I found my first volume in a second hand bookshop without knowing anything about its author or the subject matter. It was a great read and I could not wait to buy the following two volumes. I only wish I had read these books before I visited Istanbul in 1990. I loved them, they are excellent histories, the author does a great job in bringing the characters and times to live. Read the series and lose yourself in the history. Great books!\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The final volume in Norwich's history of Byzantium is a satisfying but perhaps too brief look at the last centuries and the fall of this once great empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book starts with the brilliant reign of Alexios Komnenos, followed by the many crusades, the gradual disintegration of the empire, the turkish onslaught and ends with the last of the Palaiologian emperors. There are about 400 years of history in just as many pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ending feels a bit too rushed and would have liked to get more information about the fall of the last Byzantine remnants in Morea and Trebizond. Instead, after the fall of Constantinople the author just mentions the brief dates that these places were conquered and not much else. The enclave of Theodoro in Crimea is not even mentioned even though it was only conquered in 1475 by the Ottomans making it the last outpost of the empire to fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all this three book series has been a satisfying summary of the Byzantine Empire. Norwish is a fantastic and engaging storyteller and he manages to pack hundreds of years of history, events and characters into a streamlined story.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is the final volume of a fabulous series on Byzantium. I read them many years ago when they were first published, and I still remember how eagerly I awaited each volume. The names and number of characters are mind-boggling, but Norwich does such an outstanding job with their presentation that the reader just wants more.\n",

      "\n",
      "CLAIMED BY A HIGHLANDER by Margaret Mallory has it all,murder, intrigue, and sweeping tale and handsome, rugged men in kilts. What else can I say to convince you that this second book in the DOUGLAS LEGACY is a must read, just as the first one is? Ms. Mallory's carefully crafted tale is one to keep you on the edge of your seats until the final word. i highly recommend this wonderful book!\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "To be honest, I did not expect this book to be good. But I also did not expected it to be as bad, as it was eventually. It is probably the worst book I have ever read.\n",
      "\n",
      "A friend of my bought this book, since we thought, it would be funny to read cheesy romance.\n",
      "And it was. In the beginning. Then, reading became a never ending sequence of clichés, repetition and unnecessary drama.\n",
      "A short summary: Rory, a good looking, strong and manly highland warrior, wins Sybil, an educated sexy lowland beauty, while gambling. Unfortunately, she does not know about it. A few years later, he visits her for the first time to annulate the engagement. However, since Sybil has some political trouble with the queen, and since all her brothers happen to be assholes, she decides to follow Rory. During their journey, both develop feelings for each other. Surely, this sounds cheesy, but it could have been okay, if the author Margaret Mallory would be capable of good writing. Which she is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, the protagonists are completely inauthentic and overloaded with clichés. Margaret Mallory wanted Sybil to be emancipated and sometimes, she is. But most of the time, she is just a woman who has to be saved. Again and again. While she is screaming to be saved by Rory.\n",
      "Rory is the male protagonist, hence he should be a man who the female reader can admire. However, he is not. Most of the time, he is horny or angry. Angry because he once again thinks, Sybil is distrustful or because someone threatens his clan. Then, Rory becomes a brainless asshole, purely consisting of muscles and manliness. One of the worst scenes in this book though is the scene, where he finds out, Sybil is not a Virgin anymore. Since this was something, he wanted to claim. Seriously, what a bastard! But of course it is okay, that he is no virgin anymore either. And what kind of role model is this anyways?\n",
      "But that is not the worst. In another chapter, she tells him, that the marriage contract was a fake. However she still married him, because she loves him. But he is completely out of control, raging, pressing her against the wall, spitting on the ground in front of her, leaving her alone in their bedroom, sobbing and heartbroken. For this, I wanted to beat his head into pulp so badly. Furthermore, he blames her for not being honest, however, he kept quite about having a fucking son!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, both frequently name adjectives to describe each other, which are just not true. E. g. clever. All decrictions are just that. They describe the characters. But it is not, what the reader feels. (Most of all, I feel rage.) Margaret Mallory made one of the worst mistakes, you can do in writing. She tells, but she does not show. The characters are dumb, have no mutual trust in each other just to create more drama, and frequently misunderstand each other for the same reason. This is, what the text actually tells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the Big Bad is Hector, a distant relative of Rory. He is described to be evil and full of rage against Rory. But again, that is just what they told. I did not feel it. He is lame and literally does nothing during the whole book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret Mallory furthermore has two very specific way of creating and solving a conflict. Firstly, the conflict arises but before the conflict has time to be build up proberly, only two pages later, Mallory solves the conflict, just to come up with the next one. It is like Mallory just threw up all the conflicts, that came into her mind on a sheet of paper, and tried to squeeze all of them in just one book. The second method of Mallory is to make the conflicts dull and endless. In internal dialogs, Sybil struggles to tell Rory about the fake marriage contract. Over fucking 200 pages, over and over again. Honestly, this is just very shirty story writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is so much more, I hated about the book, however, there was one good thing: One day, we glued googly eyes over Rorys face on the cover. I laughed ever time I saw it.\n",

      "Claimed By A Highlander is the second book in the trilogy, and I have to say that every time I pick up this author, I am always amazed in how much I enjoy her writing and she never disappoints, and she certainly doesn't with this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "This story sets off with our heroine, whose brothers have been declared traitors to the crown, and her life is in danger. She needs help to escape, so she can find safe haven. She is startled when a highland warrior comes to her claiming that they are betrothed due to a contract that one of her brothers set up years previous. She knows secretly that the contract is not valid, however, she is in need of this highlander's aid, so she accepts. Sybil is used to living in the city, among the courtiers and she has never been to the Highlands and she knows she will be pushed to her limits, but Sybil is more than willing to take on any challenge especially with Rory by her side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rory MacKenzie had come down to Edinburg, to try to get this marriage contract dissolved, but when he learns that Sybil is in danger and that her brothers deserted her to protect their own skins, he can't abandon her as well. So he decides to take her with him and accept the marriage contract. He knows that Sybil is a lowlander and many of his people wouldn't accept it kindly, but he senses something more about this young woman that only endears him even more.\n",
      "\n",
      "When there is a plot hatching, his brother being murdered, his sister has disappeared, and his uncle out to be the Laird of the MacKenzie clan, he knows that it is his birthright to claim Lairdship but he will have a fight on his hands especially with a lowlander for his bride. But Sybil, she may be a lowlander and spent all of her time in court, however, she is a fighter and when she realizes that she loves her husband and refuses to let him down, she fights for them both.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so IMPRESSED with this story, and man, the narrator was brilliant. It is so rare for me to fall so hard for a male narrator, but honestly, he did the accents and inflections so well...so I will definitely be looking for more audiobooks narrated by this man. This story was so intense and the historical details were so well done, although why I am surprised...because Margaret Mallory does her research so well and she really knows her time eras and the Scottish culture especially in the difference between the Highlanders and the Lowlanders in Scotland.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plot is so well detailed and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I swear, I never knew what was going to happen next and the whole \"uncle of the hero being evil\" definitely works because his uncle is pretty horrible. But what I admired most is our couple. Because they are so perfect together. Not only do they have some great chemistry, but they compliment each others' strengths and weaknesses so flawlessly. I truly was endeared by both of them. Sybil is a heroine, that may be used to certain comforts, but she takes to be a Highlander so well. You would think she was born to it, being a member of court most of her life, has taught her to be cunning and crafty and a bit creative to help with proving her husband is the right Laird for the Mackenzies. She is really the glue that holds the clan together and is so likable. She has a compassionate heart, is courageous and has a will of iron and just as stubborn as her husband. Now our hero....*swoon* can I just say that because man he is one swoon-worthy hero. I love his good heart, and how honorable he is and even though he isn't perfect, we see him work through his imperfections and learn to overcome so he can become a better man and you just have to admire that. Which I definitely do so much. :)\n",

      "The romance that develops between these two is both tender and hot!! I mean honestly, the scenes themselves aren't anything super explicit or anything, but the way that they are written just pull you in. I loved the sexual tension between these two, and you definitely see how much they care for each other in the beginning. And seeing them learn to rely on each other through the rough times ahead, really add a unique intimacy between them. And yes, they are both so stubborn and prideful, but I really appreciated that their love is what holds them together and how it makes it so they refuse to give up on each other even when lies and secrets come between them.\n",

What they never expected that a childish innocent bullying would become something so life-threatening and the neighbors and rest of the townsfolk would turn against this mother-daughter duo.\n",

      "Laura and Autumn has just moved to Bristol after the divorce. Autumn is admitted to the local public school, where she became the subject to bullying by older year boys about her looks, hair, her paintings and everything. Hearing her daughter's trauma, Laura took a step to bring up this matter to Autumn's class-teacher's notice. Unfortunately luck never played out on Autumn and Laura's favor as the teacher paid no heed to the complaints. And when one fine day, Autumn fails to return home from school, Laura gets paranoid and went outside to look for her, that is when she spotted a group of boys who have cornered her daughter and was taunting her. At the heat of the moment and as anger engulfed her, Laura took a terrible step to protect her daughter which finally left them even more terrorized and haunted till it came to the point which became life-threatening.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've always been a big fan of those kind of stories that will connect me with the story line as well as with the characters so deeply that ultimately, I'm washed over by an overwhelming feeling of pain and sympathy towards the characters. And this book falls into this category. The story is so addictive that I finished reading the book within few hours. The book is captivating and arresting from the first page to the last page that reveals an unusual kind of climax, which is justifiable. And not to mention that beautiful yet mystifying book cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author's writing style is eloquent yet the tone is dark. The author has filled the atmosphere and the mood of the story line with suspense. While reading, I had this constant feeling at the back of my mind that something terrible is bound to happen as day by day the bullying got worse with Autumn. And the air became more tensed when Laura tried to protect her daughter by taking step against bullying rather unexpectedly. The pacing of the book is super-fast as the book is thoroughly absorbing. The narrative is extremely engaging that kept me glued to the book till the very last page.\n",
      "\n",
      "The characters are very real and are well developed, highlighted with their flaws. Laura and Autumn both are the epitome of those unspoken victims of bullying. Laura is a caring mother but her on mistake made it living hell for her daughter. Autumn is meek and keeps things to herself. All through out the book, I felt simply sorry for this little girl who was bullied so much by her peers, and I almost stopped reading the book when the whole world turned against Autumn. Mainly, the characters held that psychological grip on my mind that I could not let go off even after the end of this book. The negative characters are so good and convincing with their evil and sneering demeanor, that I actually wanted to find them in real and kill them by myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author has handled and depicted the situation of bullying with sensitivity and realism. The stark reality of bullying in our society has been captured vividly by the author and bullying not only terrorizes a victim's life but it also ruins the victim's family and that the author has underlined with bold letters in her story line.\n",

      "Overall, I was left paralyzed and equally enthralled with this riveting and dark psychological thriller.\n",

      "A hard book to read for me as it deals with a sensitive topic of bullying i connected with this book from the very first page as i had been bullied in highschool it was a long 4 years for me but it made me a stronger person.\n",

      "\n",
      "So Laura goes to Ashley Grove Junior high to talk to her teacher she tells her what Autumn said & the teacher dismisses it straight away saying she is lying, when she returns home Laura hires an IT consultant to look over her computer as she is having problems with it so Aaron Jablonski turns up to fix it everything turns out fine until Laura finds out the Aaron Jablonski is Levi's father .\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Bone By Bone is both a top psychological thriller and an emotional and hard hitting look at the insidious nature of bullying - it is a bit of a page turner I read 3/4 of this in one sitting and it is scary and realistic - the realism making it more scary than if it were complete fantasy or even read as being slightly unlikely.\n",

      "Autumn is being bullied at school, her mother tries to put a stop to it and ends up making it worse after one definitive and far reaching decision made in the spur of the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nature of this novel, in that it shows the slow downward spiral of a mother and daughter whom the system lets down, is extremely topical and very haunting. As they struggle to deal with knock after knock, you will be absolutely glued to the pages, in disbelief and horror at how quickly one seemingly small incident can escalate into a targeted campaign of fear. The actions of the school, of the bully, of his Dad, of the other parents, all cleverly interwoven into the underlying sense of unease will really hit home and Sanjida Kay has a keen eye for the small details that really matter when it comes to telling a story.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the things I thought was particularly intriguing about Bone By Bone was the way it looked at many facets, the ending may be unexpected but feels absolutely right and whilst bullying is, by its very nature, a most horrific thing, there are often multiple layers at play and this novel speaks to that very well.\n",

      "First there is a well baited hook – the opening sentence begins: It wasn’t until the train went past that she saw the small body lying in the long grass by the side of the wood. From the very first sentence we are expecting the worst possible scenario. Then the element of bullying is added which plays a substantial role in the overall plot and forces the blood pressure up again and adds to the expectation of bad things to come. Further the reader is privileged to knowledge/behaviours/acts/suspicions (no spoilers here) that the protagonist doesn’t see at the time and the result – the tension is ratcheted up another notch.\n",

      "An excellent, excellent read in which journalist and veterans advocate Wallace Terry collects the oral histories of 20 black men who served in Vietnam. In doing so, he captures the voices and vital stories of an often overlooked group of soldiers who, despite sharing similar experiences of racial discrimination, represent a rich variety of geographic backgrounds, military experiences, and attitudes toward the war. The men profiled here recount often brutal truths—including some of the most unfiltered and unsettling descriptions of bodily trauma I’ve encountered in literature—and many of their accounts are not particularly happy ones (for several, returning to America after the war presented a whole new set of struggles). But scattered throughout are moments of triumph that upend expectations and insights that get at the heart of what these men have seen and experienced and endured. This book is the real deal and a must read for anyone interested in the Vietnam War.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Bloods: Black Veterans of the Vietnam War: An Oral History by Wallace Terry is one of the most powerful and moving books from the point of view of the soldiers who fought the battles day in and day out. Terry is the renowned authority on the African American soldier and experience in Vietnam. He was on the ground with the troops, interviewing them, creating the only documentary from the battlefield entitled Guess Who’s Coming Home: Black Fighting Men Recorded Live in Vietnam, released in 1972.\n",
      "\n",
      "The African American men in tell their story in their own words, the way they experienced it. Their dialects show through the written speech. Each chapter is more moving and emotional than the next, dragging the reader down into the depths of war, creating an emotional investment in each person mentioned. But the stories are not only about the battle on the front lines but the battle inside themselves, behind the lines, and back at home. Each soldier discusses their views on the Civil Rights movement that is happening while they were away and its impact on them while they are at war. The emotions are still heavy as they tell stories of black, white, Hispanic, Asian, an American soldier is a brother. Others run into different scenarios of racism behind the line and sometimes their abilities to overcome it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though was originally published in 1984, many words of the men who told their stories can still ring true today. Armchair historians, military fans, young adults, and anyone interested in a true horror story should read this oral history, but a minor amount of previous knowledge of the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement is recommended for true comprehension. These men should be honored for being willing to share with the world their experiences in such a sensitive and life-changing time period. No doubt the rapport and trust built between the men and Terry while they were in the battlefield contributed greatly to their willingness to be interviewed after their return stateside. It is through that bond of trust that the public is graced with a rich primary resource such as .\n",

      "Wallace Terry was a well-known, African-American journalist who interviewed and compiled the accounts of several African-American soldiers in the Vietnam war. These men tell it like it was on a number of topics, but most striking are the stories of how they were treated on arriving home after the war, in the midst of a strong anti-war climate, and the fact that several of them really were down on the powers that be for ending the war and handing Vietnam to the people they'd been fighting against for years. As one person noted (169): \"Why wait ten years and thousands upon thousands of lives later to just turn it over to the Communists? We could have done that at the very beginning.\" This particular sentiment is echoed throughout the book. Many discuss the racial issues both before, during and after their time in Vietnam.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author did personal interviews with 20 vets, officers and enlisted personnel, but it's never really stated whether or not the veterans were encouraged just to tell their stories or if they were being questioned specifically about their experiences. However, the stories themselves were eye-opening, and aside from me wondering about the method of interviewing, the book held my interest until I finished it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally published in 1985, and now, some forty years after the Vietnam war, it's still quite worth the time and effort to read this small book, especially for those who maybe want a different take on that conflict. I would most definitely recommend it, especially to those who are interested in the personal side of the Vietnam war and its aftermath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, very well done; at times heartbreaking, especially the reception that these men got when returning home.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "This is thesis reading, but it's so good. To read specifically about the experiences of black soldiers in Vietnam as different from that of white soldiers is necessary. Funny in some parts, and of course, touching and sad in many. This period in American history is one that has always fascinated me.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I had read this book several times in middle school and had forgotten about it until I came across a copy in a used book store. Fantastic read that pulls no punches and tells not only a fascinating story about Vietnam from the view of black veterans..but looks at how society treated blacks in the military/society at the time of the Vietnam war.\n",

      "I liked this a lot it’s a paranormal reverse harem and be aware it has triggers. Selena a baby vamp manages to escape her captivity from King Xavier. She’s been held prisoner for the last 14 months by him and he wants her for one of his mates. when she refuses this role her life is made a living hell brutality and rape is her daily existence. To add to that Selena also has a traumatic past from before she was turned.\n",
      "\n",
      "This begins just when Selena with another failed wedding attempt and condemned to death manages to break free running into the night but outside is just as dangerous for her since vampires have been discovered they are public enemy number one and staked on sight to combat this the vamps have banded together into syndicates safety in numbers. Selena falls into the path of Rock a non-human with a mysterious and tragic past an owner of a local bar he takes Selena under his wing protecting her and introducing her to others that will also assist with this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see four potentials so far for her for definite the bar owner Rock and there’s also Grayson a powerful vampire that seems to know more about her unusual origins than he’s letting on.\n",
      "As well as maybe Colton who we have briefly been introduced to here, he’s a cop with a hatred for vampires since one murdered his sister. But I’m also highly intrigued by Pike a brutal guard of Xavier’s there’s much more to him than at first seems and he was definitely trying to help her despite how it seemed I hold out hope here especially considering the cliffhanger this ended on.\n",
      "This was interesting and also very hot I’m definitely going to be picking up the next book in the series but be aware this book does have triggers.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I get that this book wants to be dark but dark at the cost of making this weird hot mess of a main character? I'm just not sure bro. With how much painful backstory she is bogged down with, it starts feeling unnatural when the whole vampy lusting is used as a blanket to avoid addressing the very obvious aftermath of being a tortured prisoner situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way the book started, I just pegged it down for being more about humping than a plot focused one. Then the assault mentions start piling up, not just as a vampire but even as a human, hell she is a kid when it starts. Now with such a heavy introduction to this character's situation what I can't grasp is her easy insta whatever with Rock. That shit moved at the pace of Flash to the extend of getting I-love-yous out, like ma'am really?! Rock can have hang-ups about sex because of his giant dick and but Selina had no hesitations? Yeah it doesn't sit well. Grayson is better but still very much lust based that keeps clashing with FMC's character story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Selina was a hollow character for all that history and just floats on these reactions that don't add up to what you expect from a just escaped prisoner. The assault factor is just too heavy for a book that's so much about humping. Then there is the barely explored world building and missed opportunities to add towards the Xavier guy or the vamp situation beyond the barebone briefs.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Likely the most important book I've read in a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "While looking for information about her own family, Siegal began to have bigger questions about The Netherlands, her adoptive country, during WWII. For example, Why did they loose a significantly higher percentage of Jews than did their neighbors?\n",
      "\n",
      "During her research, she discovered an incredible resource. Almost immediately after the war, The Netherlands government collected diaries, scrapbooks, and other firsthand accounts of their citizens' experiences during the occupation. These 2100+ written records came from all kinds of people: members of the resistance, sympathizers, people who were just trying to survive, Jews in hiding, and Jews who were deported.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this book, Siegal looks at a handful of these diaries written by very different people who lived during the Nazi occupation of The Netherlands. Historical background is interwoven with chronological diary entries that show people's reactions from different viewpoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's impossible to express how affecting this book is. Of course, it cannot answer all our questions about what happened or why people let the Holocaust occur, but it does provide insight and humanizes all sides. No matter how much you think you know about WWII, you will absolutely learn more by reading The Diary Keepers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was particularly taken by the way people reacted after the end of the war, when the few survivors of concentration camps returned and when Jews who were in hiding emerged. The interactions with their old friends and neighbors and with the world at large were not always what you might imagine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only by studying these accounts and keeping the stories alive and in people's minds will we have any chance of averting such horrors in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I often do with nonfiction, I both read and listened to this book. The audiobook is performed by a number of narrators and by the author. The narrators infused their delivery of the diary entries with emotion, fear, depression, and--yes--sometimes happiness. There were no weak performances; it was sometimes difficult to listen to because the material is so hard. I can't judge the pronunciations of the Dutch, German, Yiddish, or whatever other languages were used, but everything flowed smoothly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks so much to the publishers for review copies in various media. I bought a finished copy of the book for my personal library.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Reading through the diaries of those who were in Amsterdam during world war two was enlightening to say the least. There were so many things I didn’t know before reading this book and I’ve read quite a few historical fiction novels about World War Two. For one, I didn’t know that some Jewish families committed suicide once they heard the war was happening. I didn’t know about the protesting from the non Jewish people where they shut down factories and work places in protest of the way Jewish people were being persecuted. It warmed my heart to hear that some even wore the Jewish star in public in solidarity with Jewish people.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This book is more than just a collection of excerpts from personal diaries. It continues a conversation about compliance and complicity among civilians in an occupied territory ( one that is happening now regarding Ukraine). The diaries excerpted include Jews and gentiles; pro-Nazi and resistor. It should be on your \"must read\" list. Also full disclosure: my uncle Bill Hirzel was killed during the liberation of the Netherlands.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is a non fiction book based on the diaries of several people in the Netherlands who were Jewish and had experienced WWII. This was a tough read at times, I had no idea, for example, that three quarters of the Jewish population of the Netherlands was either killed when deported, committed suicide when they found out the Germans were coming or were betrayed by their neighbors, family or coworkers. Some also believed what the Nazis and believed that they would be returned after being sent to a work camp. We know now that was not what happened. The most famous diary from the Netherlands was Anne Frank's, her was not included in this selection, these were ordinary everyday people, a widow, a shopkeeper, a journalist, etc, their diary reflected their experiences, not always pleasant but still important to this day to be heard. The author touches on a lot of subjects, why Netherlands had such a high loss of Jewish people, why most people seemed to stand by and do nothing, and why most people wanted to forget the war and move forward with the future. All very interesting and at the same time depressing. Though I would highly recommend if you enjoy non fiction, WWII types of books. Thanks to #Netgalley and #Ecco Press for the ARC\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "In THE DIARY KEEPERS, journalist Nina Siegal presents a wide-ranging panorama of characters and events from World War II as experienced in the Netherlands, revealing horrors, heroism and a mixed view of human nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Siegal’s family emigrated from Europe, where the planned annihilation of Jews was carried out --- day by day, truckload by trainload --- over a five-year period. The Netherlands sustained a reputation as one country where Jews were protected, hidden by non-Jews, often for the duration of the Nazi occupation. Because of her family’s direct experience of those harrowing years, Siegal grew up with questions that went unanswered until she decided to tackle the subject directly, in cooperation with Amsterdam’s NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies. There she accessed the diaries written by those who lived through and observed the happenings.\n",
      "\n",
      "These diaries are presented day by day, starting in February 1941 when journalist Philip Mechanicus recorded that a group of Nazi sympathizers, along with German soldiers and local police, were prowling the streets, smashing windows in Amsterdam’s Jewish sector and beating or shooting anyone who raised an outcry against them. These incidents escalated until the Jewish quarter was closed off entirely, and people who lived there began to disappear, never to return. There were Dutch people who aided the Jewish population in a variety of ways --- hiding them in basements, storing their belongings for the day of their anticipated freedom --- while some cooperated with the invaders, either out of fear or because of a shared antisemitic viewpoint. During the years of occupation, the majority of the country’s Jews were killed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some Jews, like Siegal’s mother, managed to hide out and stay alive. But when Siegal would once refer to her mother as a “survivor,” she was chided --- that word was used only for those who had been in the camps. Such fine points of language and recollection are shimmering threads running through the diarists’ entries, combined with Siegal’s interspersed, assiduously researched commentary. Now, she notes, when so many sources --- including the world-heralded THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL --- tell so much about “Dutch resilience, resistance, and triumph against evil,” there are still those who would gloss over the less savory truth of the Holocaust in the Netherlands.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Siegal’s remarkable work relates the facts fairly and plainly, containing courageous accounting seen by those who were there. As she states, their diaries should be regarded as a “first draft of memory.” Diarist and store owner Elisabeth van Lohuizen, noting that liberation was finally at hand in May 1945, perhaps speaks for all: “Will we be free of war in the future? I hope that God will grant it. We must make every effort to make that so.”\n",

      "Review 1\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is Meriwether’s first novel and chronicles the lives of a poor black family in Harlem during the Depression in the 1930s. It is written from the point of view of Francie Coffin, the twelve year old daughter of the family. Although it is a novel there are elements of autobiography and the virago edition has an introduction by James Baldwin.\n",
      "Meriwether is still active and has received an award for social activism in 2011, this is a flavour of her speech;\n",
      "“I am a writer, and also a dedicated activist and peacenik. In New York City in my twenties I was chapter chairman of my union, marching in May Day Parades and having rotten eggs thrown at my head. In Los Angeles I was arrested in a sit-in against the racist Birch Society and sentenced to five years’ probation. In Bogalusa Louisiana I worked with the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE); back in New York I was instrumental in keeping Muhammad Ali, then world's heavyweight champion, from fighting in South Africa and breaking a cultural boycott. In Washington, D.C., I was arrested in 2002 in a protest against the disastrous policies of the World Bank and the IMF. Back in New York I was active in several forums breaking the silence about the rampant rape in the Congo and the multinational corporations and countries involved. Last year I helped set up a forum at Riverside Church on the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons.”\n",
      "It takes place over the period of about a year, 1934-1935, it is located in a particular time as the Joe Louis/Max Baer fight takes place during the novel. Francine is a very engaging narrator, which is just as well because the story is one of an unremitting struggle against poverty and injustice. Francie has the usual twelve year old concerns about family, friends and school. But there is the backdrop of little work, occasional riots and the humiliation of welfare. There are also the numbers, an illegal type of lottery and Francine’s father is a small cog in this, being a number runner. Francine also has to cope with routine sexual harassment from assorted adults; shopkeepers, men in the cinema and others. There is little choice for any of those growing up; for the boys it’s either gangs or poorly paid menial work if there was any work, for the girls prostitution, marriage and babies or laundry/cleaning work.\n",
      "It is a powerful and brilliant evocation of a time and place; portraying the ups and downs of everyday life; the characterization is also very good. Baldwin sums it up well:\n",
      "“Shit, says Francine, sitting on the stoop as the book ends, looking outward at the land of the free, and trying, with one thin bony black hand to stem the blood which is beginning to rush from a nearly mortal wound. That monosyllable resounds all over this country, all over the world: it is a judgement on this civilization rendered the more implacable by being delivered by a child. The mortal wound is not physical, the book, so far from being a melodrama, is very brilliantly understated. The wound is the wound made upon the recognition that one is regarded as a worthless human being.”\n",
      "Well worth reading.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This book, when I read it as a child sometime in the early 70's, changed my life. I didn't know, before then, that there was such a thing as a novel with a little black girl as a protagonist. I decided right then and there: I wanted to be a writer, tell my own little-girl story.\n",

      "Probably make it an end of the year favorite all over again.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Francie’s story touched my heart. I wanted her to leave 5th Avenue, away from “the struggle” but that’s really what I loved about the book so much. She was not a victim but a hero in so many ways. As a 12 year old growing up during the Great Depression, life was hard. And it sucked that Blacks were treated so poorly even when they tried to make an earnest living. Francie was just a little girl trying to navigate through the good and very bad parts of her environment. Her dad ran numbers and when that didn’t work, turned to other odd jobs. Her mother was resilient learning early on that she could not be too proud to ask for help, eventually getting herself a job and applying for relief, what we now call welfare. Her brothers were smart men dealt different cards from the very beginning- James Junior wasn’t a fan of school and wasn’t interested in college like his brother, Sterling. James Junior felt more comfortable running with the notorious gang, Ebony Earls- devastating his family. Francie wanted to keep the family together. Because she was the youngest, she was often tormented by the neighborhood kids. She accepted this punishment as a way of life and kept daydreaming about life outside of 5th Ave.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to rescue Francie from the disgusting grown men who lurked in the stairwells, on the streets and inside the grocery stores. She wasn’t safe at all and each day was a new battle. I admire her drive and precious inquiring mind. Although this book is fiction, I rooted for Francie the whole way and hope that she made it out.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Really enjoyed this coming of age story of Francie Coffin growing up in Harlem in the 1930s. Most times funny, but many times sad, this is definitely a classic. Picked it up from the library, but I'll be adding this to my personal collection.\n",

      "Claimed by the Highland Warrior is the first book in the MacKinloch Clan series and we're introduced to an amazing family and a wonderful supporting cast of friends and clan members. Taking place during the time of William Wallace, Braveheart, it's a historical adventure that could have been bogged down with the necessary world building and character introduction that takes place in most first books in a series, but I didn’t feel any of that. In fact, the story was so well told that I read it in a single day and found the secondary characters to be every bit as important and compelling as our main couple.\n",

      "On his wedding night, Bram left his young bride, Nairna, and went with his father and brothers into battle, having never even consummated the marriage. Then came the news that Bram and his brother, Callum, and their father, were killed, leaving Nairna to mourn a man she cared deeply for. Seven years later as this story opens, Bram has escaped his hellish prison and makes his way back to his wife’s family’s holdings so he can finally claim the woman he loves. Of course Nairna is overjoyed to see him alive, but neither of them are the same people they were when they first married, so she isn’t sure what to expect. Then as if that isn’t enough to contend with, when they make their way to Bram’s family at Glen Arrin, they find the keep in near ruin, the clan divided, and the Laird and his wife barely speaking, but it’s all of these things that make the story so interesting – and keeps Nairna busy!\n",
      "\n",
      "Watching Bram and Nairna deal with what we now know as PTSD – Post Traumatic Stress Disorder - was at times heartbreaking, but Nairna is such a strong, grounded woman that even though she was dealing with her own tumultuous emotions, she was able to help Bram deal with the memories and nightmares of his years of torture and captivity, while devoting herself to her new clan and her role as a wife. There are so many things to love about this story, but first and foremost were Nairna and Bram, watching as they had to first learn to trust one another and then love.\n",

      "While there were some slower moments in the story, is a romantic, passionate, and exciting beginning to the series, one which I’ll continue to follow.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "While this is not quite the swash-buckling, bodice-ripper that the title and the cover implies, it is actually quite a soulful highland romance and an enjoyable and engrossing read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bram MacKinlock left his new bride Nairna on their wedding night without consummating their marriage in a fit of jingoistic fervour to go and fight the English with his father and brothers. His father was killed and he was taken captive and held for 7 years and everyone believed him to be dead. Now he has finally escaped and returned to reclaim his bride and rejoin his family but everything has changed. Most of all him.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his absence, Nairna has remarried, lost her virginity and been once again widowed but she has never forgotten Bram and her love for him but they are both very different people now and a large part of this book is given over to these two getting to know one another again, Bram overcoming his PTSD and attempting to rebuild his clan which has fell into rack and ruin in his absence.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is rather a slow burner but it did just about enough hold my attention. The character development is well done and I found myself invested enough in these two to want them to rekindle that fire that had once burned so bright. They have a lot of near misses, passion burning and almost getting there before one of them turns away - highly frustrating! More than once I wanted to scream at them to get on with it but I did really like them both and completely understood and sympathised with their situation and felt their pain keenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one thing I can't stand in a Highland romance is a wimpy doormat of a heroine and, thankfully, Nairna is about as far removed from this as it's possible to be. She's determined to stand by her man, to help him rebuild his clan and to try and help him through his pretty obvious PTSD and staggering guilt that he carries. She's as strong as it gets and is exactly what Bram needs. He, for his part, is consumed by guilt at the continuing incarceration of his younger brother, Callum, and the death of his father - he's scarred both physically and emotionally and he's got a lot of healing to do and it was really very engaging to watch how his relationship with Nairna helped him to do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "As this is the first in a series, there's great world building going on also with a fair few MacKinloch's waiting to tell their stories to us. I'm definitely going to read through the rest of the series. Alex and his troubled marriage is up next although it's definitely the silent Callum and the feisty french Marguerite that I'm most looking forward to.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "You want to know why I liked this series? Because the people were messed up. Completely. Dude is a slave for like 7 years, escapes and the first thing he does is go find his wife. And she's not a perfect little virgin that waited for her. Nope, real life happened while she thought he was dead. I like that. I can relate to that. The guy was so messed up he just wasn't right for most of the book. Which is HOW it is SUPPOSED to be when you're tortured for that long. I can't stand these girly books that the guy/gal suffers but as soon as they get back with their honey it's like magic vagina/penis and having sex just makes it all go away.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a much more real version of life yet it was still a love story. There was still good h&h scenes that advanced the story (not just gratuitous stuff). She weaves a very compelling story with good rounded characters that have flaws.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Claimed by the Highland Warrior is my first Michelle Willingham book and it won't be my last! The first half of this book flew by and while the second half lagged a bit, I enjoyed the characters enough to definitely want to continue the series.\n",
      "\n",
      "This story opens with the hero, Bram, escaping an English prison where he had been tortured and forced into labor for seven years. He is one haunted, messed up guy, which was sad, but also made the romance compelling. Willingham dealt with trauma a lot more realistically in my opinion and the reunion between Bram and his wife (marriage never consummated) was awkward yet filled with glimmers of hope. For the first 65% of the book, I flew through the pages, reveling in the sexual tension, grittiness of the characters as they struggled to rebuild their lives and move on from their pasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the 65% mark when sex starts happening, the story slowed down a little bit. Since this is a Harlequin Historical, I shouldn't have been surprised by the repeated sex scenes, but it was a little disappointing since I felt like the sex scenes caused character development beyond this point to be stunted. It didn't completely compromise the story (hence still 4 stars), but it did keep it from being a top read. In this story, there was some interesting threads. The hero is a virgin since he was only 16 when he married, never consummated the marriage because he went on a raid the same night, and then was imprisoned for 7 years. The heroine, Nairna, actually married (and then was widowed) another man because she thought Bram had died. She had some experience with sex, but it was not pleasurable for her. Therefore, with all the darkness in the story, there was some lightness as the two characters learned new levels of intimacy together.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the story, there was some highland politics involved, but I didn't find the extra details too heavy. I'm not an expert on Scottish history during this time, so I cannot speak to its accuracy, but it read believably to me and there were several times I winced at the brutality of it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Willingham also introduced other characters, all of whom have stories in the series that I'm now interested in reading. She introduced the characters naturally and I felt like they added to the story instead of just being present as a pitch for the next book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I thought this was a nice story of recovery from PTSD, rebuilding of family ties, tough choices that are made during warfare, and healing from love. I recommend it for an easy, short read that actually has some meat on its bones--and plenty of sex scenes for those who are into that :)\n",

      "Wow. That was an epic ride through late eleventh/early twelfth century Byzantine and Middle Eastern history that covered both the reign and rule of Romanus Diogenes and the First Crusade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Holmes is an amateur historian who has done a lot of travel, research and thinking into this most interesting time period. I am (truly) amazed as he was able to impart a great deal of conflicting information in a fascinating, balanced yet nuanced way in a relatively short book.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is able to describe the politics, sociology and enmesh them in an understandable way to readers who know little of this area or time period and make it both thought-provoking and fascinating.\n",
      "He takes us into royal intrigues, alliances, betrayal and in brief broad strokes the military battles fought during this time period. Throughout the book there are timelines, maps, diagrams, pictures and a foreward of the main historical players. This added immensely to the readability and enjoyment of this most intriguing book.\n",

      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is a good, popular introduction to a much more interlinked and globalized (the \"world war\" bit is exaggerated, but I get the point) era of the Crusades than most people ever encountered in a history course or popular culture. Holmes uses new studies of the greater central Asian region to understand how actions within and by the Cumans, Seljuk turks and Arabs (not to mention mercenary Rus and Normans), in combination with internal politics and economics of the Byzantine Empire unraveled the last vestiges of Roman authority in Anatolia and opened the call for western Europeans (who, Holmes doesn't get into at any depth, had their own organizational reasons for sending their most violent and agitating far away to fight) to come wage holy war in the middle east. As usual in popular books, the footnotes and sources are in the back and minimal, so you're left guessing how Holmes interpreted the sources and what they are.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Holmes writes a vivid, intense and action-packed account of the final decades of the Eastern Roman empire: Byzantium. More fine-grained to the events than Judith Herrin's Byzantium: The Surprising Life of a Medieval Empire and with a different perspective than Tom Holland's In the Shadow of the Sword: The Battle for Global Empire and the End of the Ancient World, which focuses both on the longer view of the rise of Islam and the view from that side, the author also does an excellent job of arguing that both Big Trends and individual people shape the course of history - for example, that the First Crusade wouldn't have stood a chance if not for the fragmentation of the Seljuk Empire, but how the brilliance of certain leaders and the betrayals and political manoeuvring of others lead to certain pivotal events. He also writes with a flair for the descriptions of battle that, unlike some specifically military historians, doesn't get bogged down in the minutiae.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The Byzantine Empire was a world power during the 11th century. This book is a thorough examination of the historical facts of the empire’s decline: a military conflict with the Seljuk Turks, internal conflict, and the onslaught of the Crusades. Holmes delves into the idea that the success of the Crusades was largely due to the timing as the Byzantine Empire was in the midst of its fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The introduction of the book was fantastic: a narrative of an attack in Constantinople. The rest of the book is far more informational, though rather than being dry information like most historical nonfiction, the style is more lively and interesting. There are several sources that Holmes uses to make his assertions, and are well referenced. Some things could have been a little more examined, so it seems like the book is meant more as an introduction to the 11th century Byzantines rather than a full in depth picture of the empire. It was very well done, in my opinion, even though I’m not a big nonfiction fan. 4 stars.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I am a history aficionado. Admittedly, I haven’t read many history books in the last year or so, so I was eager to dive back in. I am glad I chose, The Byzantine World War. Anatolia, Byzantium, The Ottoman Empire, Turkey…this region is steeped in history and culture and has always fascinated me. Author Nick Homes does a superb job telling the story of the fall of Byzantium, the First Crusade and the modern origins of Turkey. His writing style, rather than dry and monotonous like many history books, is conversational and engaging. I especially appreciated the comprehensive yet succinct chronology of the Byzantine Empire and the list of rulers by year included at the end of the book.\n",

The first September rains, after such violence and hardening, are like the liberated earth’s first tears, as if for a few days this country tried its hand at tenderness. Yet at the same period the carob-trees cover all of Algeria with a scent of love. In the evening or after the rain, the whole earth, its womb moist with a seed redolent of bitter almond, rests after having given herself to the sun all summer long. And again that scent hallows the union of man and earth and awakens in us the only really virile love in this world: ephemeral and noble.’\n",

      "We are not supposed to write about the author but about the book in reviews, but when it is an autobiography and the subject of course, is the author, then writing about the author is inevitable in any review of the book. The first thing about the book is the promotion, it is disingenuous at best.\n",
      "\n",
      "The promotion of this book is about what a stellar light the author is as a founder of the Women's March - but it isn't mentioned that she (and two others) were from the Board amid accusations of anti-Semitism which was in part because of their close association with founder of the Nation of Islam,\n",
      "and who is a proud of Hitler. Farrakan was an invited speaker at their marches and events and they attended his own events. In part it was because the three women at the top, Tamika Mallory, Carmen Perez and Bob Bland were all cut from the same cloth when it came to their attitude towards Jewish people. You can look them all up. Bob Bland actually tweeted that the white supremacist New Zealand massacre was the work of American Jews. She says she was being hassled by her toddlers when she posted it. Surely you can't mention what a stellar light the author was as a founder without mentioning that she had to resign for less than stellar reasons? Or perhaps you can in marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be said she has apologised for the anti-Semitism.\n",
      "which she says was misinterpreted along with her calls for Jihad (which she says she didn't mean violently) but then she spoke alongside Rasmea Odeh at a dinner, and told the audience that she was “honored to be on this stage with Rasmea.” Rasmea Odeh was convicted for her role in 1969 for the bombing of an Israeli supermarket. Odeh lost her American citizenship over that.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the character witnesses for Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, a convict in the 1993 bombing of the WTC, was whom Linda Sarsour, at an Islamic Society of North America meeting described as her “favorite person in this room. Imam Siraj Wahhaj who has been a mentor, motivator, and encourager of mine”. (The link is to the American Islamic Forum for Democracy website on Facebook. I do not have FB so it is a webcache link).\n",
      "\n",
      "She feels that any person who supports Israel cannot be a feminist, \"Is there room for people who support the state of Israel and do not criticize it in the movement?’ There can't be in feminism,\"\"? She doesn't get to define feminism! At least one Jewish woman, an avowed feminist and a co-founder, Vanessa Wruble, was thrown out of Sarsour's movement for being an Israel-supporting feminist, although the Board denied it but refused to say why.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is I read, which you may consider biased itself, as it is written by a Jewish woman. On the other hand the author protests against Islamophobia and she is a Muslim woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a difference between being anti-Israel and anti-Semitic. There are anti-Israeli Jews, and extremely critical of Israel Jews but when the words Israeli, Zionist and Jew are used interchangeably, then it is obvious to Jews, if not all, that it is anti-Semitism. Jews are the proper judges of whether something is anti-Semitic or not, just as Blacks are the proper judges of whether something is racist or not. If it feels like you are being discriminated against or feel hatred towards you and it burns, you know it. My family is multiracial and multireligion\n",
      "So we have a lot of experience in what it feels like for us, our partners and our children when we suffer the 'slings and arrows' of other people's prejudices in words or deeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "On balance I will probably get the book, I might get it for the shop as I would like to hear other people's opinions of it that have nothing to do with my own preoccupations and preconceptions. Anti-Semitism, like misogyny strikes at my heart. Racism too, my sons are Black. I can't ignore these things and I've never found a justification for any of them that rings true with me. Prejudices are a form of conspiracy theory, facts (if they exist) are twisted to fit the agenda, research by bigots is put above peer-reviewed science and like religion, it is 'faith' that reigns the day.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "10+++ stars. A must read for those who believe in inclusion, hope and a better world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sarsour, one of the co-organizers of the Women's March, is a warrior for justice. She believes our highest responsibility is to care for one another by showing up and speaking out for the voiceless among us.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book starts with a powerful foreward by Harry Belafonte. Belafonte marched alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, JR and John Lewis during the civil rights movement. Belafonte was present and provided the inspiration for the social justice voltron, a powerful trifecta of Sarsour, Tamika Mallory, and Carmen Perez, when they created the MARCH2JUSTICE.\n",
      "\n",
      "The march was a 250 mile, nine-day event, from New York to Washington, DC. On the seventh day of the march, Freddie Gray died. He was killed in Baltimore, so the marchers changed their route in order to march on the western side of Baltimore to join other protestors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sarsour describes her memoir as a social justice manifesto. She warns that silence immobilizes us. She believes in using our voices as megaphones and states that we must never negotiate away or compromise our principles and values. She advocates for us to join together to become this nation's unshakable moral compass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her memoir is packed with poignant, heart wrenching stories, including the NYPD policing policies and practices against Muslims after 9/11. Through her efforts and the efforts of many others, NY Police Commissioner, William Bratton, in 2014 shuttered the Muslim surveillance program and indicated that the program had not generated any leads to terrorist enterprises. It was at this same point in time that Donald Trump was considering a presidential campaign run.\n",
      "\n",
      "Part One of Sarsour's book begins with this quote by Valerie Kaur, founder of the Revolutionary Love Project:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The passion to change the world flickers in you like a flame, and if you let that light go out, you will be robbing the world of your greatest gift. Your task today is not to know what the future holds; your task is to vow to protect that flame.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Highly, highly recommend! This is the best book I have read in 2023 and will most likely be the best book I read this entire year.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I have so many thoughts about this book, wow.\n",
      "\n",
      "So We Are Not Here to Be Bystanders is Linda Sarsour's memoir. She recalls her childhood in Brooklyn, the beginning of her activism, and the Women's March. It's a memoir but it's also very much about speaking up and being yourself in a world that might not accept you. It's a powerful book, engaging and well written. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to split this review into topics because I realized I'm just all over the place when it comes to this book's content. In short, to use Sarsour's style (\"Brooklyn-Palestinian-American-Muslim\"), as a liberal Israeli American-ish Zionist Jew, I don't know how to feel about this. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The heart of this book is her activism and what she's doing is so necessary and so important. Hearing about her work with Muslim immigrants or the marches that she helped organize with BLM was really empowering and interesting. The way her message comes across in her book seems so important and relevant. A lot of what I know about her comes from media talking about her so it was very cool to suddenly see how amazing her work with refugees has been.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had no idea how deep and awful the American prejudice towards Muslims was after 9/11. Sarsour describes things like FBI suddenly making people disappear, for no reason or surveillance in Muslim neighborhoods. Even if we take her work with a grain of salt, it's definitely sad to hear about and my heart hurts for every innocent person who suffered because of 9/11.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Basing myself just on this book, there was something so so problematic about the way Sarsour address the claim that she has said antisemitic things.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I see it, we all grow up with various prejudices. This world still is far from being perfect and there are so many harmful notions that we end up being taught. I think those of us that are concerned about making the world a better place should always look inside and listen to others. Our intersectional activism requires us to be ready to listen and learn. \n",
      "\n",
      "So when Jews tell Linda Sarsour that she's being antisemitic and her response is to go, \"I'm not antisemitic, I have Jewish friends\", it sounds exactly like every person who's ever said, \"I'm not racist, I have Black friends\". She doesn't pause to acknowledge that maybe Jews can tell when someone's being antisemitic or that JVP are hardly representatives of Judaism.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had read this book because I hoped to hear an explanation. She starts this book by doing a beautiful job at explaining what she meant when she spoke about jihad and yet, her acknowledgement of antisemitism is pretty much non-existent. Just as her comments about jihad were taken out of context, I had hoped to see the same for antisemitism but nope. \n",
      "\n",
      "This problem is even bigger because this is a massive problem across the Israeli-Palestinian discourse and broadly speaking, the American left. As an American, I am so here for Democrats but as an Israeli and as a Jew, it feels like there's never any type of awareness about Jews as a minority and Jewish persecution. She does so much beautiful work in uniting Americans together and it's frustrating that Jews for her only exist as a way to refute claims about antisemitism.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an Israeli, I check myself thousands of times about Islamophobia and Arab racism because I realize those things slip into our discourse and I don't want them to. I still feel like there's so much to learn. It's embarrassing and shameful that Sarsour, as a Palestinian American Muslim, does not do the same. Exactly because of her heritage, if she cares about her intersections, she should dig deep into the history of Muslim antisemitism and make sure that when she speaks up against Israel, her discourse doesn't also include antisemitism. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "I kind of hoped to see any type of comment about feminism in Muslim societies. I mean, Sarsour talks about how her upbringing was different from other people's (like her father was happy that his first born was a woman) and she takes care to point out that every religious thing she did was her choice, from an assigned marriage to the hijab. It was really nice to see, especially because that's a topic that gets so much negative attention. \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I was missing a conversation about how she feels about the sexism within the culture. Does she struggle with it? Has it always been easy for her to break out of the sexist norms and combine her feminism with her culture and religion? Does she see her experience as the majority or the minority? Her voice about this would have been really interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a minor point, her claim about how feminism needs to also speak for Palestinian women is very empty and misleading. I mean, does feminism need to speak for all women? Absolutely. That also includes Zionist women, doesn't it? I could just as easily say, \"you're not a feminist if you don't speak for Zionist women\". It's irritating because it's like she's not saying anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her claim about how you can't be a feminist and a Zionist is just ridiculous. I've gotten the impression that often people use the word Zionist because they have realized it's not politically correct to use the word Jew but ultimately, all Zionism really has ever meant is the desire for Jews to have a country. It doesn't say anything about borders or Palestinians. One state for everyone can entirely be a Zionist vision so it's just irritating that she takes the feminist cause and turns it into something that it's not. We should empower Palestinian women and Israeli women in our search for peace (and there's an actual organization that does this- Women For Peace).\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of peace, we have reached my final point.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In many ways, Linda Sarsour and I have led very similar childhoods. We both grew up speaking a Semitic language at home and English at school, we both have parents who moved to the United States in search of better opportunities, we both spent summers here in Israel-Palestine. I think Linda Sarsour and I would find we have a lot of similar childhood memories. \n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, Sarsour's parents taught her Arabic so that she would be able to communicate with relatives- mine taught me Hebrew so that I would be able to live here. My parents taught me that we would return. And now, I no longer feel comfortable hyphenating myself as an American-Israeli because I feel more Israeli while Sarsour continues to stress both of them in pretty much every speech. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think these differences are crucial. Would Sarsour come back here if she could? If tomorrow Palestine would be an independent country, would she leave her life in America and move to a country that is essentially foreign to her? \n",
      "\n",
      "In some ways, when she continues to mention her Palestinian heritage, it feels like it's just that- heritage. She mentions the importance of the right of return but would she return? When she attempts to speak for Palestinians by stressing her heritage, it's odd because her Palestinian-ness is a reflection of ethnicity rather than nationality, isn't it?\n",
      "\n",
      "When she talks about solutions, it doesn't matter to her where the border would cross or what the government would look like because it's not her life that would change radically based of this, even if she has family here. I realize this is the case for every international politics conversation and of course, you don't need to be personally impacted by a topic in order to stand up for justice but by mentioning her heritage, it comes across as if this is a matter that has severe implications for her and I just don't understand how she claim this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like to conclude by saying that I found myself watching interviews with her (dang, her Brooklyn accent is so prominent) and I was somewhat shocked by the amount of hateful and racist comments. I mean, I'd say that perhaps her activism about the conflict is misguided but between that and saying she advocates for sharia law is quite a big gap and it's awful how quickly people cross into pure hate. It shows how necessary it is that she does speak up.\n",
      "\n",
      "To sum up, is interesting. I think it could have delved deeper into certain topics, as it leaves them unanswered. I'm glad I read it because it provided insight into the American left. As a whole, if you're interested in more information about who Linda Sarsour is, this book is probably a good place to start.\n",

      "- This review is so long, what am I doing with my life\n",
      "- I loved hearing about how she organized her community and the way Basemah inspired her.\n",
      "- I feel like I'm reading way too much about Israel as a way to find context to my studies and well, this is an unexpected turn of events.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Sarsour’s book is a prime example of why history matters. It’s not just the events themselves, it’s not the date, place, or time. It’s the people that were and continue to be affected. By taking us through personal narratives, Sarsour is able to contextualize and explain the significance of a transformative period in history—one that continues to have lasting impacts. Beyond diving into the harmful effects of 9/11, Sarsour also shares insights on what it takes to organize a movement. While I wish she would have spent more time explaining the barriers she faced as an outspoken Muslim woman in a patriarchal community, she did touch upon the struggles she faced as a mother in this field, something I had never considered. I also appreciate her explaining why she chose to wear the hijab, and what it meant to be a visible Muslim. I think those conversations are important to explain the complexity of the hijab to those who may be unfamiliar with the concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a person for the people, but it’s easier for me to be reactive to injustice than it is for me to think about educating the ignorant. This book helped revive my faith, my spirit, and passion to be loud for our communities that often go unheard. While I may not agree with the significance she placed on the Women’s March (claiming it was the precursor to the political outcry after Trump’s election), learning about the organizing efforts that went behind the movement did show me how having these difficult conversations with a handful of individuals can eventually spread. She didn’t dismiss an opportunity to educate because the payout would be “too small” which is something I’ve often thought about in social justice work—focusing on systemic change because of a larger payout than focusing on changing laymen (a much more difficult, an often unwaverable task). But she showed the power of the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciate that the book focused on the political issues more than it did her individual efforts, but I do want to thank her for her resilience. And for being strong enough to realize and act upon the fact that as Muslims, our actions reflect the community, not just the individual. If she chose to express her frustrations differently, we wouldn’t have been able to progress.\n",

      "My second attempt at reading this author. It is marked Fiction/Suspense. I picked up another Randy Singer book a while ago and was disturbed by the graphic violence. However, I was assured by other readers that Singer is usually very careful to ensure his books are suitable for the Christian market....so I decided to try another. That was a mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story itself was intriguing with enough twists and turns to keep my attention. It was unpredictable--I could not have worked out the ending.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I have a lot of issues with this book\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Once again, there is a lot of graphic violence--detailed descriptions of people being executed by lethal injection and via the electric chair!? Murders at point blank range. A rape scene.....I won't continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The main character has supernatural visions that initially lead to her prosecution for a series of murders. In the latter part of the book it is confirmed that they are from God despite the character not being in any way religious. She was apparently given revelations of these graphic crimes, some of which had yet to happen, in order that she might use her knowledge for good. The visions totally terrified her and made her question her own sanity, she even considered suicide. I appreciate that this is fiction but I don't believe the God of the Bible operates like this--scaring someone out of their wits in order to see that justice is served?\n",
      "\n",
      "3. There is a scene where one character pleads guilty to murder and takes the rap for someone else. The author likens this to Jesus taking the penalty for our sin. This is a big leap--the character lied under oath, he admitted to a crime he didn't commit. The author even quotes the verse \"Greater love hath no man than this that he laid down his life for his friends,\" in connection with this character. But in actual fact, justice was not served in this instance and further sin was committed by the lie and perjury that took place.....The Bible shouldn't be used to support this kind of deception and it definitely shouldn't be compared to Jesus' sacrifice.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. There are various references to occultic and demonic versions of visions or attempts to communicate with others via the mind--telepathy, ouija boards, fortune tellers etc. Although the author makes it clear that this is not the reason his character is having the visions, there appears to be little difference in the practical outworkings. The character herself questions the source because she is not religious. It is dangerous even in fiction to blur the lines when dealing with the supernatural. The author doesn't make the consequences of dabbling in these things clear enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The main defence used in the trial is for DID--a personality disorder resulting from a traumatic event in someone's past. The author suggests that the character is then split into multiple personalities due to a rape she experienced at college. One persona commits the murders with the other seemingly completely unaware of what she is doing. Despite the final outcome and the fact it is fiction, I think it is unwise for a Christian author and lawyer to be advocating this type of defence for such a serious crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was disappointed by this book. There is nothing that distinguishes it as a Christian book apart from a few vague references to God towards the end and the seriously flawed attempt to make the comparison to Jesus' death on the cross. Randy Singer would do better to write for the secular market. He is said to be the Christian version of John Grisham, but having recently re-read a John Grisham book, I would suggest that Grisham's book was less offensive and had just as many references to God as Singer's.\n",

      "I don't recommend this book for Christian readers and I won't be attempting to read any further books by Singer.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A crazy story, with plenty of twists and turns...but, I loved it! Some readers may find this a bit edgy for Christian fiction, but, we need more media in that genre that doesn't shy away from serious issues...because the Bible definitely doesn't do that.\n",
      "Review 3\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I REALLY liked this book. Would probably give it 8.5 on a 10 star scale. I am very stingy with the last stars, since they mean that I want to re- and re-read the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was great about this book??? Its a courtroom drama / thriller with psychological undertones, which I expected by the title. The style is similar to the Patterson, Grisham, etc novels, but the thing that lets me recommend it unreservedly to my friends is the absolute lack of objectionable language. There are some PG13 situations, as this is a legal-based drama. But, I don't believe that they are sensationalized, just mentioned in the course of the plot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other reviews I read (after reading the book and deciding that I REALLY like it, lol) disparage the 'preachy' tone. I didn't catch that at all, and did not know that the author was a pastor until reading the authors' notes at the end of the book. There was certainly some religious content, and the subject of God was present. Until the final chapter, I never found it to even present an 'agenda', though, and felt that it was more like the PG13 material...simply part of the plot. Face it, in the 'Bible Belt', people integrate religion into their lives, so it's natural for their faith to be part of the plot.\n",

      "I loved this wonderful book. The characters really intrigued me and the story just kept on giving all the way through. I just couldn’t stop reading and I wanted to find out what was going to happen next. It was sad at times but, it was also happy and I’m excited to read the next one in this series. My thanks to Netgalley and the publishers for giving me the opportunity to read this book in return for an honest review.\n",

      "Brothers and Sisters of Byland Crescent by Bill Kitson is the beginning of The Cowgill Family Saga. It is a touching family saga that follows the life of Albert Cowgill who is determined to escape his humble beginnings. We follow Albert has he works his way up in a wool company, marries, and starts a family. We get to meet Albert’s colleagues, neighbors, and children. When the children grow up, they marry, and have children of their own. It is a realistic story that includes life’s ups and downs. The author captured the Great War with the battles and what the people involved endured (soldiers and nurses for example). So many families were forever changed by their losses. The author did not shy away from difficult subjects. He also added characters that you would not normally find in a historical saga. Brothers and Sisters of Byland Crescent is an emotional novel. It was interesting to learn about the wool trade and see how it changed with the industrial revolution. The book follows the Cowgill family from 1878 through 1922. This is a story that will keep you riveted once you get into it. It is a little bit of a slow starter, but I soon found myself engrossed. I had a tough time putting it down (the dog insisted on going for his walk). I liked the author’s writing style. It made for an engaging and easy to read historical novel. Brothers and Sisters of Byland Crescent moved along at a good pace. I am eager to read the next installment in The Cowgill Family Saga. Brothers and Sisters of Byland Crescent is a dramatic saga with an ambitious Albert, the helpful Hannah, a bustling business, a fine family, a waging war, a smarmy snake in the grass, and a startling surprise.\n",

      "I was looking for a family saga and this didn’t disappoint. Love that it is set in Yorkshire - brings to life the world at the turn of the century and during the First World War focussing on family and family business as the core. If you like this, you will be pleased it is the first of a trilogy.\n",

      "I do love a family saga and this is one of the best!\n",
      "Right from the very beginning, I felt at home with the Cowgill family. This first novel sets the scene for their background, ambitions and place in the world. While it is set before and during the first world war, such details are only covered as in how they affect the family. Having read Bill Kitson's novels previously, I knew this would be well written but it was more that that; it was one of 'those' novels - you know the type - where there is always something happening where you just HAVE to find out what happens next and end up reading far longer than you intended! Unusually for me, I couldn't leave this family alone and went on to read the second and third books in quick succession. A truly wonderful family saga and one with plenty going on to keep you fixed and entertained. I couldn't fault this, therefore five stars is the only way to go. Definitely recommended.\n",

      "\n",
      "CLAIMED BY A HIGHLANDER by Margaret Mallory has it all,murder, intrigue, and sweeping tale and handsome, rugged men in kilts. What else can I say to convince you that this second book in the DOUGLAS LEGACY is a must read, just as the first one is? Ms. Mallory's carefully crafted tale is one to keep you on the edge of your seats until the final word. i highly recommend this wonderful book!\n",

      "To be honest, I did not expect this book to be good. But I also did not expected it to be as bad, as it was eventually. It is probably the worst book I have ever read.\n",
      "\n",
      "A friend of my bought this book, since we thought, it would be funny to read cheesy romance.\n",
      "And it was. In the beginning. Then, reading became a never ending sequence of clichés, repetition and unnecessary drama.\n",
      "A short summary: Rory, a good looking, strong and manly highland warrior, wins Sybil, an educated sexy lowland beauty, while gambling. Unfortunately, she does not know about it. A few years later, he visits her for the first time to annulate the engagement. However, since Sybil has some political trouble with the queen, and since all her brothers happen to be assholes, she decides to follow Rory. During their journey, both develop feelings for each other. Surely, this sounds cheesy, but it could have been okay, if the author Margaret Mallory would be capable of good writing. Which she is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, the protagonists are completely inauthentic and overloaded with clichés. Margaret Mallory wanted Sybil to be emancipated and sometimes, she is. But most of the time, she is just a woman who has to be saved. Again and again. While she is screaming to be saved by Rory.\n",
      "Rory is the male protagonist, hence he should be a man who the female reader can admire. However, he is not. Most of the time, he is horny or angry. Angry because he once again thinks, Sybil is distrustful or because someone threatens his clan. Then, Rory becomes a brainless asshole, purely consisting of muscles and manliness. One of the worst scenes in this book though is the scene, where he finds out, Sybil is not a Virgin anymore. Since this was something, he wanted to claim. Seriously, what a bastard! But of course it is okay, that he is no virgin anymore either. And what kind of role model is this anyways?\n",
      "But that is not the worst. In another chapter, she tells him, that the marriage contract was a fake. However she still married him, because she loves him. But he is completely out of control, raging, pressing her against the wall, spitting on the ground in front of her, leaving her alone in their bedroom, sobbing and heartbroken. For this, I wanted to beat his head into pulp so badly. Furthermore, he blames her for not being honest, however, he kept quite about having a fucking son!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, both frequently name adjectives to describe each other, which are just not true. E. g. clever. All decrictions are just that. They describe the characters. But it is not, what the reader feels. (Most of all, I feel rage.) Margaret Mallory made one of the worst mistakes, you can do in writing. She tells, but she does not show. The characters are dumb, have no mutual trust in each other just to create more drama, and frequently misunderstand each other for the same reason. This is, what the text actually tells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the Big Bad is Hector, a distant relative of Rory. He is described to be evil and full of rage against Rory. But again, that is just what they told. I did not feel it. He is lame and literally does nothing during the whole book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret Mallory furthermore has two very specific way of creating and solving a conflict. Firstly, the conflict arises but before the conflict has time to be build up proberly, only two pages later, Mallory solves the conflict, just to come up with the next one. It is like Mallory just threw up all the conflicts, that came into her mind on a sheet of paper, and tried to squeeze all of them in just one book. The second method of Mallory is to make the conflicts dull and endless. In internal dialogs, Sybil struggles to tell Rory about the fake marriage contract. Over fucking 200 pages, over and over again. Honestly, this is just very shirty story writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is so much more, I hated about the book, however, there was one good thing: One day, we glued googly eyes over Rorys face on the cover. I laughed ever time I saw it.\n",

      "\n",
      "This story sets off with our heroine, whose brothers have been declared traitors to the crown, and her life is in danger. She needs help to escape, so she can find safe haven. She is startled when a highland warrior comes to her claiming that they are betrothed due to a contract that one of her brothers set up years previous. She knows secretly that the contract is not valid, however, she is in need of this highlander's aid, so she accepts. Sybil is used to living in the city, among the courtiers and she has never been to the Highlands and she knows she will be pushed to her limits, but Sybil is more than willing to take on any challenge especially with Rory by her side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rory MacKenzie had come down to Edinburg, to try to get this marriage contract dissolved, but when he learns that Sybil is in danger and that her brothers deserted her to protect their own skins, he can't abandon her as well. So he decides to take her with him and accept the marriage contract. He knows that Sybil is a lowlander and many of his people wouldn't accept it kindly, but he senses something more about this young woman that only endears him even more.\n",
      "\n",
      "When there is a plot hatching, his brother being murdered, his sister has disappeared, and his uncle out to be the Laird of the MacKenzie clan, he knows that it is his birthright to claim Lairdship but he will have a fight on his hands especially with a lowlander for his bride. But Sybil, she may be a lowlander and spent all of her time in court, however, she is a fighter and when she realizes that she loves her husband and refuses to let him down, she fights for them both.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so IMPRESSED with this story, and man, the narrator was brilliant. It is so rare for me to fall so hard for a male narrator, but honestly, he did the accents and inflections so well...so I will definitely be looking for more audiobooks narrated by this man. This story was so intense and the historical details were so well done, although why I am surprised...because Margaret Mallory does her research so well and she really knows her time eras and the Scottish culture especially in the difference between the Highlanders and the Lowlanders in Scotland.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plot is so well detailed and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I swear, I never knew what was going to happen next and the whole \"uncle of the hero being evil\" definitely works because his uncle is pretty horrible. But what I admired most is our couple. Because they are so perfect together. Not only do they have some great chemistry, but they compliment each others' strengths and weaknesses so flawlessly. I truly was endeared by both of them. Sybil is a heroine, that may be used to certain comforts, but she takes to be a Highlander so well. You would think she was born to it, being a member of court most of her life, has taught her to be cunning and crafty and a bit creative to help with proving her husband is the right Laird for the Mackenzies. She is really the glue that holds the clan together and is so likable. She has a compassionate heart, is courageous and has a will of iron and just as stubborn as her husband. Now our hero....*swoon* can I just say that because man he is one swoon-worthy hero. I love his good heart, and how honorable he is and even though he isn't perfect, we see him work through his imperfections and learn to overcome so he can become a better man and you just have to admire that. Which I definitely do so much. :)\n",

I mean honestly, the scenes themselves aren't anything super explicit or anything, but the way that they are written just pull you in. I loved the sexual tension between these two, and you definitely see how much they care for each other in the beginning. And seeing them learn to rely on each other through the rough times ahead, really add a unique intimacy between them. And yes, they are both so stubborn and prideful, but I really appreciated that their love is what holds them together and how it makes it so they refuse to give up on each other even when lies and secrets come between them.\n",

      "Let's face it: phones, TikTok, Zoom meetings, hybrid working, you name it--it's all technology that's here to stay. It's unrealistic to think that people are really going to put their devices down in the office, in the classroom or at dinner. I struggle with this. We're all up against extreme odds in getting people to REALLY be present and pay attention to us, and at the same time, it's just so easy to be distracted by your own technology. I appreciate that Jeanine Turner points out that it's not an either/or proposition. She puts forward a number of ways we can optimize how, when, and where we communicate to optimize meaningful exchanges. It's all about choice and bringing intentionality to HOW we communicate with others. It's fluid: it can flex and change throughout the course of conversation. There might be times when you need to demand attention (entitled presence), although that often doesn't work so well, but sometimes it can, if it's for short durations. There are times when you have to calibrate how much you are interacting in a given moment (budgeted presence). And there are times when you can bring the other person actively into choosing how to communicate (invitational presence), among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are whole people bringing our whole selves to work, and play. It's important to be aware of how and when we communicate, especially because we are mostly mediated by technology at this point. This book gives excellent real-world examples in the home and at work that everyone can relate to, and has helped me to be a lot more thoughtful when I interact with, well, everyone!\n",

      "El capítulo del presupuesto de la presencia, donde uno divide su atención para estar en varias reuniones a la vez o conversaciones a la vez, es escalofriante si te pones a pensar... significa que nuestra capacidad como seres humanos para mantenernos concentrados, dando full presencia a otra persona en frente de nosotros está directamente proporcional al grado de interesante / entretenido / necesario / urgente.\n",

      "This is a fantastic book, with critical relevance for all facets of life. Turner’s call to understand and choose intentionally our social presence is a necessary and constant task, which (I think) most people don’t fully grasp. I appreciated how Turner doesn’t engage in ranking the types of presence or casting some in a negative light; each of the four types of social presence has a place in our daily life, but bringing awareness to them and learning to actively manage — or better, choose — social presence is a skill needed by each of us, daily.\n",

      "To solve a problem, you must understand the problem first. This book does a decent job of defining problems in communication due to technology.

      "Why do we cry? How come love hurts? And what's a happiness researcher doing writing about sadness, anyway? Well, it turns out the two aren’t mutually exclusive. After eight years of investigating into happiness, Helen discovered a startling fact: most of us are terrified of being sad. So phobic, in fact, that we jeopardise our chances of truly living at all. This needs to change, because we need our sadness: it’s a message. It can tell us what’s wrong and what to do about it. Researchers have found that allowing for temporary sadness, counter-intuitively, makes us happier. And trying to avoid sadness – even to the extent many of us do on a daily basis – is detrimental to our mental health. So the time has come to get better at having difficult conversations. How To Be Sad is part memoir, part manifesto for change in how we express our emotions, good and bad. Exploring why we get sad; what makes us sad; how sadness can be a force for good; the truth about crying; why some of us get sadder than others; what we can do when we’re sad; and what we definitely shouldn’t do. Including the history of sadness, how other cultures handle theirs, the differences between sadness and depression, addiction, grief, heartbreak, burnout and everything in between.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russell interweaves personal testimony with the latest research on sadness from psychologists, psychiatrists, geneticists, neuroscientists and historians as well as the experiences of writers, comics, athletes and change-makers from both sides of the Atlantic. How To Be Sad includes interviews with former medic Adam Kay, Joshua Becker (Becoming Minimalist), Meik Wiking (The Happiness Research Institute), Ella Mills (Deliciously Ella), Jeremy Vine (BBC), journalists Matt Rudd (The Sunday Times) and John Crace (The Guardian), polar explorer Ben Saunders, Yomi Adegoke (The Black Girls Bible), comedian Robin Ince, Julia Samuel MBE (Grief Works) and Mungi Ngomane (Everyday Ubuntu). This is a fascinating, insightful and accessible read brimming with anecdotal evidence and cases to back up the author's claims. It explores how sadness is a vital part of life and discussion about this was much more thought-provoking than I had initially imagined it would be. It's an intriguing and well written book compiled by one of the most prominent scientists in her field and is published at a time when many are facing more sadness than they have ever felt before. How To Be Sad is a guide for anyone who has ever been sad. A book about how we can all get happier by learning to be sad, better. \n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Russell has an appealingly self-deprecating style and breezily highlights statistics alongside personal anecdotes. Here she faces sources of sadness in her life head-on: her younger sister’s death from SIDS and the silence that surrounded that loss; her parents’ divorce and her sense of being abandoned by her father; struggles with eating disorders and alcohol and exercise addiction; and relationship trials, from changing herself to please boyfriends to undergoing IVF with her husband, T (aka “Legoman”), and adjusting to life as a mother of three.\n",
      "\n",
      "As in her other self-help work, she interviews lots of experts and people who have gone through similar things to understand why we’re sad and what to do about it. I particularly appreciated chapters on “arrival fallacy” and “summit syndrome,” both of which refer to a feeling of letdown after we achieve what we think will make us happy, whether that be parenthood or the South Pole. Better to have intrinsic goals than external ones, Russell learns.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also considers cultural differences in how we approach sadness: for instance, Russians relish sadness and teach their children to do the same, whereas the English, especially men, are expected to bury their feelings. Russell notes a waning of the rituals that could help us cope with loss, and a rise in unhealthy coping mechanisms. Like Susan Cain does in , she also covers sad music (vs. one of her interviewees prescribing Jack Johnson as a mood equalizer). There are lots of laughs to be had, but the epilogue can’t fail to bring a tear to the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "A reread, though I only skimmed the first time around – my tiny points of criticism would be that the book is a tad long – the print in the paperback is really rather small – and retreads some of the same ground as (e.g., how exercise and culture can contribute to a sense of wellbeing). I read that just last year, after enjoying with my book club. She’s a reliable nonfiction author; I’d liken her to a funnier Gretchen Rubin.\n",

      "[Original review, based on a skim in July 2021: Russell has a fun, informal style. This would make a fine follow-up to . The premise is that we shouldn’t have to apologize for being sad, but can learn some techniques for alleviating depression. The book is about half memoir and the other half interviews/research/general information. Russell has had many causes of sadness in her life: her younger sister died of SIDS and her parents split; she’s suffered from eating disorders and infertility; she’s had bad break-ups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually she had three children (two of them twins via IVF), but, to her surprise, this didn’t mean that she had “arrived” and would never be unhappy again. For her postnatal depression she was offered drugs or therapy, still the go-to solutions. But, she found, other things could help, too: a good diet, exercise outdoors (especially cold-water swimming), being part of a buddy system, and helping others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other topics she covers include perfectionism, bullying, Victorian mourning culture, and happiness by country – a topic she’s written a whole book about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two bits that stood out for me: When she interviewed Henry Hitchings, he told her he thinks Brits are intolerant of sadness and expect people not to show their pain; people from other countries were more sympathetic when his mother died. I also noted that one-third of U.S. presidents lost a father when young.]\n",

      "In this perfect Instagrammable life that we are supposed to be leading, there is no space for boredom or sadness. These things do not fit in the busy lives of influencers and celebrities and they expect us to follow their lead. Not only are we not allowed to be sad now, but people are scared of this emotion and seem to want to do every to protect themselves and their loved ones from experiencing it. Only the visible outpouring of grief for celebrities that we have never met seems to be acceptable forms of emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But being sad is just a normal emotion it shouldn’t be something that we push to one side in the hope that it will go away and we can carry on as before. In this book, Russell thinks that we should fully embrace it, learn what is happening to us when we are sad and the best ways of getting through it and out the other side. She has had plenty of time to be sad in her life, details of which she expands on in the book. Sometimes her sadness leads onto moments of depression and other illnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are lots of things out there to help us when we are suffering from moments of sadness the music to choose, the places to go, apps that can help when you are at your lowest ebb and the buddy system so you can have a person to lean on as and when you need it. There is even a recommendation for reading fiction when sad, and if you can’t bring yourself to pick up a book then an audiobook can have the same effect. Getting out of the home can be a big help too, either for a walk or if feeling particularly brave cold water swimming.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought that was a really well-considered and researched book that Russell has written about the subject of sadness. I feel that she is spot on with her conclusion that the pursuit of happiness and the perfect ‘Instagram’ life is causing so many problems, especially when people have those times in their lives that don’t conform to their expectations. Even though she has written this book to help you, it doesn’t feel like a self-help book. She is not preachy but guides with humour her experiences about how to be sad and how to get through it in a positive way. The advice is sensible and more importantly achievable and she details how that will help us to appreciate the happier times much more. Well worth reading. 4.5 stars.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I really enjoyed this book and its exploration of sadness. I felt like Russell was holding my hand and saying “absolutely nothing is wrong with you and your sadness is fine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t feel the blurb fully encompasses what to expect from this novel, as it is a part memoir as well as part exploration of the emotion sadness. She speaks to a range of researchers, people with lived experience and shares her own life story with us. These three components make for a digestible, comforting and informative read. Russell talks about what to do when you’re feeling sad, how to talk about being sad and sitting with yourself when being sad. Overall, she really advocates for simply accepting sadness will be a part of life and you do not need to battle it constantly, or constantly strive for happiness. And with the use of researchers, science, and her story I think she achieves her goal. This is a good self-help book for dealing with general ups and downs in life and I think the messages here are useful for everyone. There is a jam-packed reference section as well as a resource section that allows readers to go beyond her book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed the way Russell approached this, as well as her writing style and also appreciate that she speaks about seeking professional help for the other challenges in her life (that go beyond just being sad). She embraces the distinction between mental health conditions and plain sadness, urging readers to discover what’s right for them but working through their sadness. A book I’ll re-read and I can certainly say I’m a fan of this author!\n",

      "So, I love books about books. And in this one Pulitzer prize-winning critic Michael Dirda provides glimpses of and comments on his own commonplace book. This eclectic collection contains delightful thoughts, lists, and book recommendations. I can’t do better than Dirda’s own words, so here are my favorite passages:\n",
      "\n",
      "On discussing books with philistines:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quote a verse from the Bible or a line from William Wordsworth, mention the date of a battle or a character out of Charles Dickens, and expect to be regarded with a mixture of awe and suspicion. Erudition makes people feel uneasy; at worst it can seem vaguely undemocratic. Better to talk about last night’s episode of the latest sitcom, something we can all enjoy equally.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On guest room libraries:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now the essential quality of a proper guest-room book is that it must avoid all the normal requirements of a ‘good read.’ Nothing too demanding or white-knuckled suspenseful. Ideally, items should be familiar, cozy, browsable, above all soothing . . . .”\n",
      "\n",
      "On pride and prejudice:\n",
      "\n",
      "“One of the reasons we should read widely is to avoid falling into the more obvious rifts of prejudice and paranoia. . . . Books, by their very nature and variety, help us grow in empathy for others, in tolerance and awareness. But they should increase our skepticism as well as our humanity, for all good readers know how easy it is to misread. What counts is to stay receptive and open, to reserve judgment and try to foresee consequences, to avoid the facile conclusion and be ready to change one’s mind. No matter how sure you may be of a course of action, no matter how committed to any belief, remember Oliver Cromwell’s plaintive entreaty: ‘I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "On rereading:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once we know the plot and its surprises, we can appreciate a book’s artistry without the usual confusion and sap flow of emotion, content to follow the action with tenderness and interest, all passion spent. Rather than surrender to the story or the characters - as a good first reader ought - we can now look at how the book works, and instead of swooning over it like a besotted lover begin to appreciate its intricacy and craftmanship. Surprisingly, such dissection doesn’t murder the experience. Just the opposite: Only then does a work of art fully live.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Read it. Slowly, savoringly. Or devour it. But, by all means, mark your favorite passages and read it again.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I loved this book. It's a fusion between Dirda's commonplace book and one of those \"Booklust\" type of books. I own Booklust, but am very impatient with it. I have a hard time getting past one of the very first lists of books, where all of the authors are named \"Alice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm supposed to read a bunch of books whose sole connection is that they were written by an Alice? I just don't get that. In fact, it pisses me off. I've got at least 200 unread books on my shelf all clamoring for my attention; I don't need cutesy ploys to get me to read books.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I digress. Dirda's lists of books make me yearn to drop everything and read every book mentioned because his lists are well thought out. The books he suggests are all connected in real and intelligent ways, not artificial and stupid ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not just a book of lists and quotes from books, though. He has essays mixed in, too, and not hollow \"why reading is good\" essays (another sort of thing that pisses me off because I'm not an elementary-school reluctant reader). They're essays about life and morals and being a thinking human being.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a short little book but I loved every minute of it, enough so that I ordered my own copy immediately.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "3.8 🌟\n",
      "After a few pages in, I thought this was more like a commonplace book, full of quotes from other books. Immediately, I felt detached because reading a single quote by itself could lead one to misunderstand what it really means. However, the more I read, the more I like the way the author put down his perspectives. There are 10 different topics discussed in this book. By page 8, book recommendations are getting out of hand.\n",
      "It also made me realized that what I'm looking in reading is stories; good stories and new knowledge. Yes, I couldn't care less if the author of a certain book wins an award or not, a certain book is popular or not. If I find the story is good, it's good, doesn't matter what language, what kind of literature or where it comes from. It also made me think\n",
      "of those who read only the list-of-book-that-should-be-read books without having the desire to browse in a library and finding hidden gems.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Read, then no one can resist revisiting the book again and again. A wonderful source of inspiration by Michael Dirda who’s not only succeeded in compiling a huge list of great authors together with their great quotes in one small book but also in showing the readers how the power of the written words could make your life more interesting and more richer by understanding the wit and wisdom from it. Big book doesn’t have to be big, no? There are also some tips and advice on how to encourage kids to read more, advice on marriage, love, life etc etc.. Nothing beats advice from an old timer!\n",

      "\n",
      "Claimed by the Highland Warrior is the first book in the MacKinloch Clan series and we're introduced to an amazing family and a wonderful supporting cast of friends and clan members. Taking place during the time of William Wallace, Braveheart, it's a historical adventure that could have been bogged down with the necessary world building and character introduction that takes place in most first books in a series, but I didn’t feel any of that. In fact, the story was so well told that I read it in a single day and found the secondary characters to be every bit as important and compelling as our main couple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Goodreads blurb –\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On his wedding night, Bram left his young bride, Nairna, and went with his father and brothers into battle, having never even consummated the marriage. Then came the news that Bram and his brother, Callum, and their father, were killed, leaving Nairna to mourn a man she cared deeply for. Seven years later as this story opens, Bram has escaped his hellish prison and makes his way back to his wife’s family’s holdings so he can finally claim the woman he loves. Of course Nairna is overjoyed to see him alive, but neither of them are the same people they were when they first married, so she isn’t sure what to expect. Then as if that isn’t enough to contend with, when they make their way to Bram’s family at Glen Arrin, they find the keep in near ruin, the clan divided, and the Laird and his wife barely speaking, but it’s all of these things that make the story so interesting – and keeps Nairna busy!\n",
      "\n",
      "Watching Bram and Nairna deal with what we now know as PTSD – Post Traumatic Stress Disorder - was at times heartbreaking, but Nairna is such a strong, grounded woman that even though she was dealing with her own tumultuous emotions, she was able to help Bram deal with the memories and nightmares of his years of torture and captivity, while devoting herself to her new clan and her role as a wife. There are so many things to love about this story, but first and foremost were Nairna and Bram, watching as they had to first learn to trust one another and then love.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there were some slower moments in the story, is a romantic, passionate, and exciting beginning to the series, one which I’ll continue to follow.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "While this is not quite the swash-buckling, bodice-ripper that the title and the cover implies, it is actually quite a soulful highland romance and an enjoyable and engrossing read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bram MacKinlock left his new bride Nairna on their wedding night without consummating their marriage in a fit of jingoistic fervour to go and fight the English with his father and brothers. His father was killed and he was taken captive and held for 7 years and everyone believed him to be dead. Now he has finally escaped and returned to reclaim his bride and rejoin his family but everything has changed. Most of all him.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his absence, Nairna has remarried, lost her virginity and been once again widowed but she has never forgotten Bram and her love for him but they are both very different people now and a large part of this book is given over to these two getting to know one another again, Bram overcoming his PTSD and attempting to rebuild his clan which has fell into rack and ruin in his absence.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is rather a slow burner but it did just about enough hold my attention. The character development is well done and I found myself invested enough in these two to want them to rekindle that fire that had once burned so bright. They have a lot of near misses, passion burning and almost getting there before one of them turns away - highly frustrating! More than once I wanted to scream at them to get on with it but I did really like them both and completely understood and sympathised with their situation and felt their pain keenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one thing I can't stand in a Highland romance is a wimpy doormat of a heroine and, thankfully, Nairna is about as far removed from this as it's possible to be. She's determined to stand by her man, to help him rebuild his clan and to try and help him through his pretty obvious PTSD and staggering guilt that he carries. She's as strong as it gets and is exactly what Bram needs. He, for his part, is consumed by guilt at the continuing incarceration of his younger brother, Callum, and the death of his father - he's scarred both physically and emotionally and he's got a lot of healing to do and it was really very engaging to watch how his relationship with Nairna helped him to do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "As this is the first in a series, there's great world building going on also with a fair few MacKinloch's waiting to tell their stories to us. I'm definitely going to read through the rest of the series. Alex and his troubled marriage is up next although it's definitely the silent Callum and the feisty french Marguerite that I'm most looking forward to.\n",

      "You want to know why I liked this series? Because the people were messed up. Completely. Dude is a slave for like 7 years, escapes and the first thing he does is go find his wife. And she's not a perfect little virgin that waited for her. Nope, real life happened while she thought he was dead. I like that. I can relate to that. The guy was so messed up he just wasn't right for most of the book. Which is HOW it is SUPPOSED to be when you're tortured for that long. I can't stand these girly books that the guy/gal suffers but as soon as they get back with their honey it's like magic vagina/penis and having sex just makes it all go away.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a much more real version of life yet it was still a love story. There was still good h&h scenes that advanced the story (not just gratuitous stuff). She weaves a very compelling story with good rounded characters that have flaws.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Claimed by the Highland Warrior is my first Michelle Willingham book and it won't be my last! The first half of this book flew by and while the second half lagged a bit, I enjoyed the characters enough to definitely want to continue the series.\n",
      "\n",
      "This story opens with the hero, Bram, escaping an English prison where he had been tortured and forced into labor for seven years. He is one haunted, messed up guy, which was sad, but also made the romance compelling. Willingham dealt with trauma a lot more realistically in my opinion and the reunion between Bram and his wife (marriage never consummated) was awkward yet filled with glimmers of hope. For the first 65% of the book, I flew through the pages, reveling in the sexual tension, grittiness of the characters as they struggled to rebuild their lives and move on from their pasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the 65% mark when sex starts happening, the story slowed down a little bit. Since this is a Harlequin Historical, I shouldn't have been surprised by the repeated sex scenes, but it was a little disappointing since I felt like the sex scenes caused character development beyond this point to be stunted. It didn't completely compromise the story (hence still 4 stars), but it did keep it from being a top read. In this story, there was some interesting threads. The hero is a virgin since he was only 16 when he married, never consummated the marriage because he went on a raid the same night, and then was imprisoned for 7 years. The heroine, Nairna, actually married (and then was widowed) another man because she thought Bram had died. She had some experience with sex, but it was not pleasurable for her. Therefore, with all the darkness in the story, there was some lightness as the two characters learned new levels of intimacy together.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the story, there was some highland politics involved, but I didn't find the extra details too heavy. I'm not an expert on Scottish history during this time, so I cannot speak to its accuracy, but it read believably to me and there were several times I winced at the brutality of it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Willingham also introduced other characters, all of whom have stories in the series that I'm now interested in reading. She introduced the characters naturally and I felt like they added to the story instead of just being present as a pitch for the next book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I thought this was a nice story of recovery from PTSD, rebuilding of family ties, tough choices that are made during warfare, and healing from love. I recommend it for an easy, short read that actually has some meat on its bones--and plenty of sex scenes for those who are into that :)\n",

Betsy Devonshire, owner of needlecraft shop Crewel World, is asked by her roofing contractor to look into a 5 year old unsolved double murder of which he had been accused but not convicted due to lack of evidence, but of which he claims his innocence. A nice addition to the series. I did find the talk about ghosts a bit strange but am getting to know the characters a bit more. Betsy is getting more accepted by the townspeople and her reputation at solving crimes is increasing. A nice mystery but overshadowed a bit by needlecraft information.\n",

      "Here is a book that makes you start looking for the release date of book #2. Riley is a fun character who is relatable and easy to connect with. I wasn't even trying to figure out the mystery of the story; instead, it was more enjoyable to read along and get lost in the smart and witty writing. Such an impressive debut. Ready to see Riley return!\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "What a fun, quirky, mystery! This was exactly what I needed to comfort me during these uncertain times. Riley is a library assistant who has a fascination with obituaries. When Riley's best friend, Jordan, dies her parents ask her to write the obituary. The one snag is that Riley thinks there's something fishy surrounding the circumstances of Jordan's death. In addition to playing detective, Riley has been dumped by her high school sweetheart and decides to give online dating a try. Hilarity ensues! I can't wait to give this to all my girlfriends for their beach vacations\n",

      "I normally don't read \"mystery-lite\"-type books, but after hearing the author speak I decided to give this one a try. I'm glad I did. It was a great weekend read--would be perfect on a beach or a plane (well assuming your seat mates didn't mind hearing the occasional burst of laughter). I laughed a lot. And I enjoyed the mystery, which reminded me a bit of something out of Murder She Wrote in terms of the amount of actual danger our heroine is in. I also loved all the library humor. Go figure! This read will appeal to fans of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels and Elaine Viets' dead-end-job series.\n",

      "I picked up an early release copy of this book, and it was such a fun ride! Riley is the 20-something protagonist in whom we can all recall a bit of ourselves: young, newly single, and ambivalent about her future. When she decides to reconnect with an old best friend, only to learn that she died the day before, Riley goes on a mission to uncover the truth of what really happened.\n",
      "Full of laughs, quirky characters, suspense, and a little love triangle (and who doesn't love a good love triangle!?), this was a truly entertaining page turner that picks up momentum with each chapter. Not a book to be missed!\n",

      "Jill Orr's first novel \"The Good Byline\" was a great read. The book flowed from beginning to end. The only negative I have (and it's a very small one) is that I got tired of the obituary history. The book was quick read.\n",
      "I'm hoping Ms. Orr continues the series because I can't wait to see what kind of trouble Riley and Holman get into and I'm also rooting for Riley to get together with Ajay.\n",

      "The third and final volume of Norwich's trilogy on the Byzantine civilization carries the empire through the Crusades, the rise of the Ottoman threat, and the disintegration - through internal miscalculation and external apathy - of the culture that kept Greek and Roman influence alive throughout the Dark Ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Standing as a bulwark against the ravaging hordes of the East, she provided safe passage for resentful religious armies intent on \"liberating\" Jerusalem, came frequently to the negotiating table in an attempt to heal her rift with the Latin papacy, and succumbed to the role of your basic marketing hockey puck through centuries of ruthless full-body checks between the shipping magnates of Venice and Genoa.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the sad years, rife with ineffectual leadership and short-term solutions, sacrifice and loss. Norwich catalogues it all, and honors this titanic kingdom in full as it fades forever from view.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Sometimes history reads like a tragedy, and the story of the final centuries of the Byzantine Empire is one of those times. Yet there is a certain beauty in tragedy, and that’s present too, perhaps best exemplified when Emperor Constantine XI removes his imperial regalia and charges into a hoard of enemy Turks as the city of Constantinople falls, the emperor never to be found and the city never to be redeemed.\n",
      "\n",
      "John Julius Norwich does his own sum-up best: “The Roman Empire of the East was founded by Constantine the Great on Monday, 11 May 330; it came to an end on Tuesday, 29 May 1453. . . . Byzantium may not have lived up to its highest ideals—what does?—but it certainly did not deserve the reputation which, thanks largely to Edward Gibbon, it acquired in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century in England: that of an Empire constituting, ‘without a single exception, the most thoroughly base and despicable form that civilization has yet assumed.’ So grotesque view ignores the fact that the Byzantines were a deeply religious society in which illiteracy—at least among the middle and upper classes—was virtually unknown, and in which one Emperor after another was renowned for his scholarship. . . . It ignores, too, the immeasurable cultural debt that the Western world owes to a civilization which alone preserved much of the heritage of Greek and Latin antiquity, during these dark centuries when the lights of learning in the West were almost extinguished. . . . Robert Byron maintained that the greatness of Byzantium lay in what he described as ‘the Triple Fusion:’ that of a Roman body, a Greek mind, and an oriental, mystical soul.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed Norwich’s writing style and appreciated his distinction between facts, suppositions, theories, and legends. Well worth reading for anyone who enjoys history.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This, the final volume of a three book series, brings to end a rivetting and excellent history of the Byzantium Empire. I cannot add anything to the other reviews and comments on this series other than to say if your enjoy reading about history you should love these accounts of this Empire and its times. I found my first volume in a second hand bookshop without knowing anything about its author or the subject matter. It was a great read and I could not wait to buy the following two volumes. I only wish I had read these books before I visited Istanbul in 1990. I loved them, they are excellent histories, the author does a great job in bringing the characters and times to live. Read the series and lose yourself in the history. Great books!\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The final volume in Norwich's history of Byzantium is a satisfying but perhaps too brief look at the last centuries and the fall of this once great empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book starts with the brilliant reign of Alexios Komnenos, followed by the many crusades, the gradual disintegration of the empire, the turkish onslaught and ends with the last of the Palaiologian emperors. There are about 400 years of history in just as many pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ending feels a bit too rushed and would have liked to get more information about the fall of the last Byzantine remnants in Morea and Trebizond. Instead, after the fall of Constantinople the author just mentions the brief dates that these places were conquered and not much else. The enclave of Theodoro in Crimea is not even mentioned even though it was only conquered in 1475 by the Ottomans making it the last outpost of the empire to fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all this three book series has been a satisfying summary of the Byzantine Empire. Norwish is a fantastic and engaging storyteller and he manages to pack hundreds of years of history, events and characters into a streamlined story.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is the final volume of a fabulous series on Byzantium. I read them many years ago when they were first published, and I still remember how eagerly I awaited each volume. The names and number of characters are mind-boggling, but Norwich does such an outstanding job with their presentation that the reader just wants more.\n",

      "I really enjoyed this story, it was a lil something different. I couldn't give it 5 stars because of the poor editing that caused me to have to re-read sentences or fill in words that should have been there. Also there were some parts that were just unrealistic i.e. going in on the connect. Even if ya dad's name rang bells and that's some of where you get your respect from, he's not here anymore. Setting a building on fire to kill someone isn't smart. Killing them then setting the bodies on fire is a better approach. Help might come before they die from smoke inhalation, then what??? I loved the fact that Tyree took that responsibility on no questions asked since he knew he took her virginity. Hated that they used nicknames the whole time. Just my personal peeve. Didn't take away from the story at all. Loved how organically their love grew. Again, great story. Characters could've been a lil more developed. If this is a first time author, you have great potential. Please don't be offended by my comments. They are only intended to help you grow as a storyteller. Blessings.\n",

      "Although the story was good there were a lot of short sentences. I felt the story was rushed as if the author was trying to complete this book. The first few chapters I thought I would just closed the book because as I was reading it I thought it read like a child's book. About the characters, Ro was a college stupid and Tyree owned his own car dealership and both ended up having a one night stand leaving Roxanne pregnant. She was hormonal, depressed, greedy, making irrational mistakes, rude, smart mouth, and feisty. Tyree was straight up rude in the beginning, but became a man about his business. He was supportive, didn't take shit from anyone, he would murder you if you came for his family (Ro & baby).\n",
      "\n",
      "Janiya who was Tyree's girlfriend was stupid. She was 7 years older than Ree and immature. I think she got what she deserve in the end for targeting a pregnant woman. Roxanne's mom should be a shame putting her child out with no where to go,\n",

I didn't believe the fact that his brother in college just gave up his info on how to reach him to a girl he didn't know. She could have been anyone trying to get at him clearly as Jaynae did further in the story. I loved the fact that he was a real man even though he was a thug, he owned up to the fact it was his baby. I found it very hard to believe him being in the streets and not taking precautions with her safety knowing someone was after him. Overall a good read but so many important facts were left out. Her mother making the phone call worried about her then turns around and dismiss her and her unborn again was leaving me hanging.\n",

I didn’t like how childish she would act he left you in the house ok you was sleeping. I also wasn’t sure about tyree character I understand your a business man and a respected “thug” but he carried yourself more like a wannabe thug at some points. It was a good book just needed a little more details.\n",

      "I found the writing too simple, stilted, and amateurish for my taste; it felt like a grade school paper. None of the characters grabbed my attention; our main character, Agatha, goes on about how her magic goes wrong and she has no control over the ‘bigger’ spells, then proceeds to ‘teach’ the FBI agents a lesson by using magic against them as easily as flipping a finger at a gnat and stating they had better treat a witch better than they did. Her familiar, a micro-unicorn she spelled years ago, is obnoxious rather than funny. Not to mention the cover art has nothing to do with the story (a full grown woman and a unicorn-Agatha was quite young when she spelled the unicorn). If I get a free next book I may read it to see if the writing improved, but I certainly won’t go out of my way to find other books by this author.\n",

      "This could have been a fun story but the writing lets it down. The first half is entirely backstory told by two women conversing as a child spies upon them. Then the child gets taken by the hand and told more backstory. I was wondering if anything was ever going to happen forwards. Since nobody is in any danger, we don't really care about the outcomes of all the gossip. So the young lady who is, we now understand, a witch with a small familiar, is asked to join the FBI because 'since the witches and supernaturals came out of the closet' there is a demand for their skills. In a good way, we hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two points struck me; the Nazi Party would have put vampires to use, especially those described here, who would have certainly come forward to the evils of the day. Saying vampires only came out of hiding after the war makes no sense. And if this young witch has the unstoppable powers she demonstrates, the FBI are not the ones who would want to control her. Some of the concepts are certainly interesting.\n",

      "Even though I’m an Orthodox Jew, I have a deep connection to Dorothy Day’s Catholic Worker movement. I volunteered at one of her “hospitality centers” a/k/a homeless shelters when I was in high school, and it was there that I was given the name of the man who would eventually become my first rabbi, Reb Shlomo Carlebach. I was also offered the chance to live there as a volunteer, but I did the conventional thing and went to college instead. What a mistake! I might have lived the life of spirituality and service I’d been searching for right away. Instead, I didn’t follow up with Reb Shlomo for another three years, and I never gave the Catholic Worker itself a second thought until very recently. Dorothy Day has been getting more notice lately. She was the subject of one chapter in ’ , and the Pope mentioned her in his address to Congress in 2015. Only then did I realize that the offer I’d received back then was part of a greater historic tradition of service. I’ve been both flattered and curious ever since. But to add something beyond my own personal interest, many say that the Pope’s public mention of her is an indication that she’s under consideration for canonization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of all that, I went into this biography expecting to read about a saint, but this book is anything but hagiographic. The author is Dorothy Day’s granddaughter, and she doesn’t shy away from showing her grandmother’s feet of clay. Dorothy’s own daughter, the author’s mother, had a rather harsh life as a result of her mother’s conversion. As a child, she had to share her with the many needy people who came through the Catholic Worker. Then she followed the Catholic prescriptions of marrying young and having lots of kids. She also followed the back-to-the-land prescriptions of Peter Maurin, the movement’s co-founder. While farming may seem romantic to urbanites like Dorothy and me, it’s much harder to actually live it, and this book shows how poorly the farms fared over the years. I wouldn’t have thought it possible, but I ended up admiring Tamar (the daughter) much more than Dorothy. It was my impression that Dorothy admired her more, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I read this book, I identified with Dorothy Day because had a bohemian youth and became religious, and I hoped the book would teach me how to incorporate left-wing values into religious practice. But what I discovered from the book was a different parallel to my life: the pitfalls of religious child-rearing. There’s nobody more gung-ho than a convert or , but in attempting to give over our values to our kids, we often end up causing them to resent those very same values. And yet, both Tamar and Kate (the author) love Dorothy and the Catholic Worker. So I can only conclude that religion is a complex matter. It appeals to the best side of us, but often, we and the others around us don’t measure up. What’s to be done about it? Be like Peter Maurin. Show your fellows forgiveness and patience. Everybody has a , even saints.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Dorothy Day is an interesting historical figure, the woman that founded The Catholic Worker, which was initially a combined newspaper, homeless shelter, and soup kitchen. I once subscribed to The Catholic Worker, and since it cost one penny per issue, you couldn’t beat the price. I saw this biography available and snapped it up from Net Galley; thanks go to them and Scribner, who provided me with a DRC in exchange for an honest review. This title was published in late January and is now available for purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always had a difficult time getting a handle on what The Catholic Worker stood for. The name suggests radicalism, and indeed, Day was red-baited during the McCarthy era. Day was a Catholic convert and a strong believer in sharing everything that she had with those that had nothing. She worked tirelessly and selflessly, and despite often living an impoverished existence somehow made it into her eighties before she died, an iconic crusader who became prominent when almost no women did so independently—though she was no feminist, and believed that wives should submit to husbands. Since her demise, speculation has arisen as to whether she might be canonized.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was that huge crash? Was it a marble statue being knocked the hell off its pedestal? Hennessy takes on the life and deeds of her famous grandmother with both frankness and affection. In the end, I came away liking Day a good deal less than I had when I knew little about her. Her tireless effort on behalf of the poor included anything and everything her very young daughter had in this world, and at one point she remarked that she felt unable to ask others to embrace a life of poverty if her child wasn’t also a part of that. It was a different time, one with no Children’s Protective Service to come swooping down and note that the child was sleeping in an unheated building in the midst of frigid winter; that there was no running water, since the building was a squat; that the only food that day was a single bowl of thin soup and perhaps a little hard bread donated from the day-old stores of local bakeries; that even small, personal treasures and clothing given the child by other relatives and friends would either be stolen by homeless denizens or even given away by her mother, a woman with the maternal instincts of an alley cat. Day did a lot of good for a lot of people, and no one can say she did it for her own material well being, but she more or less ruined her daughter’s life, and even when grown, Tamar’s painful social anxiety and panic attacks derailed her efforts to build a normal life for herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, the immense contribution that Day made at a time when the only homeless shelters were ones with a lot of rules and sometimes religious requirements cannot be overlooked. She is said to have had a commanding presence, endless energy (and the mood swings that accompany such energy in some people), and a mesmerizing speaking voice. Day’s physician also treated the great Cesar Chavez, and reflected that their personalities were a lot alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "I confess I was frustrated in reading this memoir, because I really just wanted the ideas behind the Catholic Worker laid out for me along with the organizational structure. Was the whole thing just whatever Day said it was at the moment, or was there democratic decision making? I never really found out, although I gained a sense that the chaotic events shown in the memoir reflected an unarticulated organizational chaos as well. This is a thing that sometimes happens with religious organizations; the material underpinnings are tossed up in the air for supernatural intervention, and the next thing they know, there’s an ugly letter from the IRS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only about half of this memoir was actually about Day; my sense was that the author did a lot of genealogical research and then decided to publish the result. The first twenty percent of the book is not only about Day’s various romantic entanglements; a significant portion of the text is mini-biographies of those men, and frankly, I wasn’t interested in them. I wanted to know about Day. Later I would be frustrated when long passages would be devoted to other relatives and their lives. Inclusion of daughter Tamar was essential, because Dorothy and Tamar were very close all their lives and shared a lot, and so in some ways to write about one was to tell about the other. But I didn’t need to know about Day’s in-laws, her many and several grandchildren, and so on. I just wanted to cut to the chase, but given the nature of the topic, also didn’t want to read Day’s own writing, which has a religious bias that doesn’t interest me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those with a keen interest in Dorothy Day and the Catholic Worker may want to read this, because not many books are available that discuss her life and work. On the other hand, I don’t advise paying full cover price. Get it free or at a deep discount, unless you are possessed of insatiable curiosity and deep pockets.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is an insider biography of Dorothy Day, a relational memoir of the mother-daughter relationship between the activist Day and her only living child, Tamar. Kate Hennessey, Day’s youngest granddaughter, explores the legacy of Day, not as the 20th century prophet, the social activist, the prolific writer who gave life to numerous communities of radical Gospel hospitality, simplicity and prayer, but as the single mother of a daughter who she never understood and often left feeling neglected, betrayed and diminished. Day is one of my personal heroes. I often wondered about her daughter, growing up in the shadow of such a formidable, uncompromising figure, in the midst of the chaos of the nascent Catholic Worker. This book gave me a very different picture of Day: flawed, domineering, able to be sensitive to the needs of broken strangers but dismissive of the needs of her own child, yet loved and loving despite that. This was a 4 star read for me because I was very interested in the central figures. Without that extreme interest, I think this would be a 3 star read.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A dreary book. The writing is dry and often stilted. Stories come across like a soda gone flat -- I can imagine they would have been more interesting had the writing been better.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author is, perhaps, too close to her subject to give a good account. To my taste, she spends waaaay too much time discussing her mother (Day's daughter) and father, not to mention her own life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciate getting a perspective of Day that is human, not hagiographical, but I have rarely read a more tedious book.\n",
      "Review 5\n",

      "This book is for you if… paranormal fantasy is something you can get behind, it's not for everyone. You will be rewarded with a well-rounded plot and a decent romance, experienced by the typical ya heroine that discovers she's destined for superhuman miracles. TW: sexual assault.\n",
      "\n",
      "⤐ Overall.\n",
      "Chosen by Grace, the first novel in the Divine Fate paranormal series by Alicia Rades, managed to exceed my expectations although I can't say what they were. Albeit too short for my liking, I still enjoyed the audiobook a lot. The narrator, didn't really agree with me at first. There was an airy, guttural quality to her voice I first needed to got used to but came to like in the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty much from minute one on I was enamoured with the story and the characters, they were diverse, fun to get to know and relatable. Whereas other authors of that genre tend to go for the cocky arse hero, I'm glad to see Alicia managed to create a multifaceted love interest that was not perfect but still hella cute. She chose to paint a male hero that was decent and kind throughout most of the book, who displayed errors most of us can quite well identify with.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writing style is somewhat unobtrusive. I'm sure adding more colour to it would greatly contribute to the story-telling and the way the reader receives this story. Put together with the above, Alicia made for a well-structured plot that offered small twists. There's a lot of potential I hope to discover being made use of in the sequels.\n",

      "It's really hard to write this review, because I honestly can't pinpoint what it is I loved about it. For all purposes, this book is a generic angels vs. demons in a chosen one scenario, but somehow, Alicia Rades just did it better. Maybe it's the broody boy with the dark past who DOESN'T hold back pulling the Edward Cullen \" you must stay away from me \" nonsense; Marek was open and kind. Maybe it's that no one tried to hide facts from Ryn, the MC, about things that involved her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked Ryn well enough. She wasn't super original as a character or anything, but she actually listened when people said \" don't do that, it's dangerous.\" We all know that MC that can't help but attempt to save the day even though she's useless (ugh). She also doesn't cave on her morals no matter what anyone says, which I can respect. Let's also talk about the fact that one of her parents is actually alive, hooray!

      "1.5 stars.\n",
      "I wanted to like this but it felt like reading an early draft. It was like the skeleton of a story. The author had put ideas she wanted to explore, but none of it was developed. We had mother and daughter who had growing issues and resentment they didn’t talk about, we had the heroine who has yet to form real bonds of friendship, and we had a potential love story.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we look at this story as a finished product, it doesn’t rate highly with me. The setting wasn’t fleshed out and given character, and I didn’t feel like I was pulled into into any of the scenes (my five senses weren’t engaged) because of the lack of description.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story felt erratic and choppy. One minute the teenagers are being serious about life threatening attacks, the next the best friend is pulling the heroine to the side to say she should get with the teenage guy who saved her life. (This is the same scene where the heroine's safety is being addressed.) the majority of the beginning was one long infodump educating the heroine about her supernatural heritage and legacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also had some cheesy dialogue with the hero vs demon exchanges. I did like some of the friendly banter between the characters, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the pacing was atrocious. The author jumped from one major catastrophe to the next with little down time, zooming through the scene as fast as possible. She doesn’t take the time to really delve deep within each scene to build suspense and tension, to let us feel like we the reader have our necks on the line too. I never felt my emotions being wrenched. I want to feel my own heart beat when the heroine's heart flutters around the hero. It didn’t happen. I wanted to feel sadness at the broken mother-daughter bond. Instead, all I felt was frustration with the writing and the lack of exploration.\n",
      "\n",
      "It felt more like I was reading visual directions and guidelines for a movie. Unfortunately for the author, books don’t have the advantages of pauses, music scores, actor's expressions, camera angle, and atmospheric lighting to set the mood and play on the reader's emotions. Instead, all this must be accomplished using words alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why I stated that this felt like an incomplete draft. It’s missing details, descriptions, character exploration, stronger voice, and many words before this book is complete. I didn’t even feel any chemistry between the characters, especially the romantic interest. Good plot, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d advise the author to go back to her story and revise it. It’s not ready yet. I suggest reading highly rated contemporary fiction and thrillers to look at examples on how to draw out emotion and suspense. The author focuses too much on the supernatural aspect to hold up the novel, which doesn’t work.\n",

      "Ryn and her mother just moved to a new town, the most recent in a long string of places they have bounced around to. Ryn is excited to attempt to stay in one place, especially since she made a new friend. But one night while at a party, something crazy happens- Ryn hands glow and the imaginary shadows she has tried to ignore her whole life are real. Ryn has no idea what is going on but now she is part of a world she never knew existed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am such a sucker for Angel books, there was a point where I read any and all I could get my hands on but I feel like at a certain point they all started blending together and being too much of the same. I have since taken a break from a certain celestial obsession but when I came across Chosen by Grace my interest was peaked and I was swayed by the gorgeous cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am happy to report that Alicia was able to create a new variation on the Angel genre. There was still the ultimate conflict between good and evil but the religious connotations were removed and instead the Davina are offspring from the Divinities, powerful godlike creatures who started the world. The Aedes are similar to demons but have different kinds of powers and relationship dynamics with humans, still full of evil intent but slightly justified in my opinion. I won't say too much more about the world in case of spoiling the surprises, but I thought the way the magic or essence rather manifested was interesting as well as the tie in to the name of the book was just about perfect and unpredictable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only was there magic, a war between good and evil, a vendetta, a great friend dynamic, regular high school drama, mystery and secrets, but there was also a dash of romance. I am almost always a fan of romance sprinkled in my stories and this was no different. I did happen to see it as soon as the love interest was introduced but I still enjoyed their relationship build as well as the fact it was not super angsty or a love triangle. Keep in mind that this was pretty pg when it came to romance, maybe more pg-13 when dealing with the violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is just the start of what looks like an epic series. The initial conflict was resolved within these pages, but that is a hint of the war that is to come. There was no cliff hanger ending which I appreciated, but the adventure is not even a little bit over. This was a fast and fun YA paranormal read perfect for a lazy afternoon.\n",

      "The purpose of Newport’s How to Be a High School Superstar is to change the student’s perspective on high school life and college admissions. Newport gives you useful advice concerning what college admissions are impressed by and enlightens the reader regarding certain myths about college requirements. He tells the readers steps to enjoying your high school years while getting accepted into your preferred college. For example, Newport says, “(1) Pack your schedule with free time. (2) Use this time to explore. (3) Master one serious interest. Don’t waste time on unrelated activities. (4) Pursue accomplishments that are hard to explain, not hard to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The theme of this novel is quality over quantity. Newport reveals that doing a cluster of unrelated activities that you are not passionate about does not impress colleges and will not benefit you overall. He believes stressed students with no free time will not be rewarded for their demanding schedule. He advises readers to do find what they are passionate about and focus on that particular interest. For college admissions, the quality of their work in doing what they enjoy will far outweigh the quantity of multiple half-hearted activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author’s style of writing is an exposition. It is an exposition because he is establishing facts about a topic to bring clarity to his idea. An example of this style of writing is when Newport tells the story of a girl named Kara. She has a meeting with her guidance counselor, who tells her that her grades (B’s) aren’t good enough to get into Stanford. Then he tells us, “Kara did get in. In fact, Kara go into twenty of the twenty-one schools she applied to, including MIT, Caltech, Columbia, Cornell, Berkeley, John Hopkins, and, of course, Stanford—proving, to the surprise of her counselor, that those schools do occasionally accept students with B’s.” This style of writing is effective because using specific examples and facts help the readers become convinced by any idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed this nonfiction book because it informed me on how to get into your preferred college, which I believe will affect my entire life. I admired how the book had examples of students who succeeded using this technique. I would not change anything about this novel. How to Be a High School Superstar is unlike anything I have ever read because it introduced an idea that I never considered.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I agree with the central thesis of the book: High school students are over-involved in uninteresting activities at which they are merely good, and thus they need to choose one or two genuine, innovative pursuits to bolster their college admissions chances. However, the road to the kind of achievement Newport promotes isn't available to most students for various reasons (socioeconomic status, personality preferences, etc.). Essentially, by following the map he lays out, talented, intelligent, and hardworking students will be able to keep being talented, intelligent and hardworking students, but at Yale instead of UConn. Obviously, there's a market for that kind of advice, and Newport has done well by himself to make use of it. Unfortunately, I don't think this is a work that has much usefulness for the majority of high school students.\n",

      "This is one of those books where you might roll your eyes at the title and walk away. I wouldn't have been interested- I mean, we get enough of this stuff with day-to-day life around here- but someone recommended it to my husband, who recommended it to me. It was actually a refreshing take on college admissions. The author's point is that straight-A, athletically successful, volunteering, high SAT-scoring, student body presidents- or that type of student- are now a dime a dozen- and rather boring to college admissions officers. However, students who eschew keeping up such a grind, but rather find their own interests and excel at them, will stand out to college admissions committees. The author explains how students can free up time by dropping activities that don't mean much to them or to admissions officers, and gain time for pursuits that are interesting to them and also to colleges. My one fault with the book is that it still is focused on how to get into traditional top-notch schools, and doesn't acknowledge that getting into those schools is not every student's goal. I guess the assumption is that if you can get into top tier schools, you can get in anywhere.\n",

      "“Getting into a good college doesn’t have to be a reward for extreme sacrifice; it can be, instead, a side effect of the much grander goal of building a meaningful and engaging life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How to be a High School Superstar\" by Cal Newport proposes an unorthodox method to securing a spot in your dream college. According to popular belief, to stand out in college applications, one must immerse themselves in a wide range of extracurricular activities and an abundance of difficult courses. Contrary to this, the book showcases a different, more laid-back approach in achieving the same goal: the relaxed superstar approach. This lesser-known method features lots of free time, less stress, and higher odds of getting accepted into your dream school. It proposes the ideology that doing is the foundation for becoming impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book provides specific steps and methods on how exactly this can be achieved. With the help of thorough research and plenty of interviews, the message aimed to be delivered by Newport comes across quite smoothly. The instructions and steps given are easy-to-follow and are written clearly. What I also really liked about the book was that it gave study methods that are much more efficient and less taxing than the usual techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "As seen in the quote I derived from the book itself, its teachings are not only applicable in a high school student's life. These strategies can also help one yield benefits richer than getting into their dream school.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this in mind, I definitely look forward to applying these concepts, theories, and techniques presented in the book to my life. I believe that taking these to heart and internalizing them will truly yield exceptional results. I believe that the techniques given in this book are not only applicable to high school students; this may also be an insightful read to those applying for jobs or are in college.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I highly recommend this book for high school students, especially those who are currently or planning to drown themselves in difficult courses and an overabundance of extracurricular activities in order to higher their odds of a better future. You might learn a thing or two from this book.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "This was an awesome book! I think it's encouraging to high school students and it is engaging enough for a high school student such as myself to read without losing interest. Below are the main points of the novel, summarized to the best of my abilities:\n",
      "\n",
      "Part 1: The Law of Underscheduling\n",
      "- Relaxed superstars basically do less, but seem to do more.\n",
      "- Instead of pursuing many activities that you are not actually interested in (resumé padding; breadth without depth; call it what you will), and taking the most challenging and impressive-sounding courses, free up your schedule.\n",
      "- This means that you might have to *gasp* quit classes and activities that don't really matter to you.\n",
      "- Make time to explore your interests and develop a genuine, deep interest ( passion!) - become an interesting person.\n",
      "- Try to achieve an ideal student workday and set a specific time every day to stop working. By separating your work time and your free time, you'll be more focused and effective when you work, and you'll get more out of the time you spend exploring your interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "- The Superstar Effect: Little differences in ability lead to huge differences in benefit. The best way I can explain this is the Olympics. Even if you are beaten by a millisecond, a silver in the Olympics reaps way fewer benefits than gold.\n",
      "- In other words, being good is usually not enough to create impressiveness. You have to be the best.\n",
      "- Also, it doesn't matter how difficult the activity actually is, as long as you are the best at it in the admissions pool.\n",
      "- The Superstar Effect only takes effect if there is 'proof' that you are an expert/master/the best at the activity, such as press coverage or glowing recommendations.\n",
      "- Once you accomplish something, you can achieve complementary accomplishments with little additional effort. If you have a solid foundation in leadership, as one of the book's examples did, you'll continue to achieve things related to leadership with little effort on your part.\n",
      "- If you have identified one thing to focus on, you need to become good at it. You can do this by learning how to be good at it (reach out to experts but also study failures), completely immersing yourself in the activity, and reaching the point where you are skilled enough that good opportunities will come your way (opportunities that won't require an excessive time commitment).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "- People are impressed by things that they cannot imagine themselves doing - so the goal is not to do something difficult, but to do something that is hard to explain.\n",
      "- Innovators don't try to be innovative. They don't have a Eureka! moment where they suddenly dedicate their high school careers to one grand project.\n",
      "- Innovators join closed communities (communities that people recognize, but do not understand the inner workings of) and pay their dues. In other words, they become positively recognized within the community first.\n",
      "- Innovators don't start out with the biggest idea. They start with small, doable projects and work their way up to an 'impressive' project.\n",
      "- Basically, people who succeed take the opportunities they get and work hard, which leads to more opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hopefully the summary is informative to those of you who are unsure if the book would be helpful. I have definitely left out some good points made in the book, so if these main points pique your interest, I would recommend checking out!\n",

      "Leena is about to graduate high school...an exciting time for most girls, but Leena lives in Ridyah, Saudi Arabia, where women live lives dominated by and segregated from men. With her political activist father in jail, her mother struggling to keep them fed, and her best friend recklessly breaking all the rules, Leena has enough on her plate thinking about now instead of a future comprised of either fleeing the country to freedom, going to university on a scholarship, or getting married to a man she doesn't love. Then half-American Daria arrives, and turns Leena's world upside down.\n",

      "Leena is filled with anger—at society, at missing opportunities, at the unfairness and ridiculousness of everything. This isn't about covering up and wearing a veil, or even really being segregated and modest around men. It's about choice and freedom. The ability to choose simple things for oneself, to make decisions and go places without being chaperoned by a male relative. To learn to drive—and to travel without a guardian. To have your cell phone untracked and its camera left intact. To not have to walk the balance between staying fashionable for your friends (all women) while projecting modesty to avoid being sold out to the police. To not have to worry about being shaved or stoned for immodesty.\n",

      "A fascinating first person story about the life of a teenage girl in Saudi Arabia.\n",
      "Librarian: Yes, I'll recommend It for purchase. In the school library community we talk a lot about the importance of providing students with books that allow them to spend time inside the thoughts and experiences of someone from another culture, To that end we see lots of books about minority communities and about people living in countries in Europe or Asia. However, outside of a handful of memoirs, the Middle East is rarely represented. This book hopefully signals a change to all that. It provides a beautiful, and heartfelt look at the lives of teenage girls growing up In Saudi Arabia. Absolutely worth picking up.\n",
      "Reader: Set in Saudi Arabia in 2011 (right after the Arab spring) Driving by Starlight explores what it is to be a teenage girl growing up in a world where every action is a crime. The world is terrible. And yet it's beautiful at the same time. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a look into a world that most of us can (thankfully) only imagine.\n",

      "For those unfamiliar with the series, the books are first-person narratives told in Jane Austen’s voice, recounting a series of adventures never before disclosed to the public as the quiet spinster encounters murders, spies, and other dark mysteries, all of which supposedly take place during the gaps in her surviving correspondence. The earliest books in the series were a bit too modern-romance for me, but over the years I have developed a deep respect for Stephanie Barron’s skill and taste. It seems to me that she has had the wisdom to base her writing not on Jane Austen’s style in the novels but on the looser, more intimate and casual language used in her letters. I definitely “hear” Jane Austen the person in the words and attitudes of these novels.\n",
      "\n",
      "The books in the series could theoretically be read as stand-alones, but one’s understanding of the character and the storylines would definitely be enhanced by reading the entire series in order, even if the earliest books require a bit of patience.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book opens on personal tragedy, one of many endured by Jane Austen and her family over the years. Her favorite brother Henry summons her to London to be present as his beloved wife, the wild and irrepressible Eliza, loses her life to breast cancer. Henry is bereft and Jane, who loved her sister-in-law dearly, sad and exhausted, and between them they agree to spend a few weeks recuperating at the seaside. Jane is all for the quiet pleasures of Lyme out of season, but Henry opts for Brighton.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the way there, they find themselves in the midst of an abduction and rescue a young girl from her abuser, who turns out to be none other than the notorious George Gordon, Lord Byron, the popular poet! They snatch the girl from the teeth of His Wickedness, much to his rage, and restore her to her equally irate and ungrateful father, who lives in Brighton.\n",
      "\n",
      "This chance encounter sets the story rolling, as the father and daughter and the troubled lord, along with the Prince Regent and his associates at his summer home, the Marine Pavilion, all come to figure into the mystery that ensues. The tale is heavily populated with some of the most notoriously ill-conducted members of the aristocracy, all brought to outrageous life, and Henry and Jane have their hands full coping with the multiple scandals.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have read biographies of many of the people involved, and their portrayals here seem quite true to life to me even though the specific events are products of the author’s imagination. Even the level-headed Jane has her head turned a bit by the dark allure of Lord Byron, especially after he troubles himself to flatter her. The portrayal of the period’s manners also impresses me with its accuracy. I found only one small error, and it was of the most trivial: most of England at this time drank green tea, and Jane would not probably not have been served China Black at an inn.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all its drama and crazy twists, I found this lively tale of murder and wickedness quite believable, and enjoyed the ride immensely.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Stephanie Barron’s cozy mystery series features real-life author Jane Austen as a fiery champion of justice, and Barron makes the stories totally believable. In this, the 10th in this series, Jane repairs to Brighton with her grieving brother Henry after the lingering death of Henry’s wife, the gay Eliza. At that time, Brighton was the fashionable watering hole favored by the corpulent, immoral Prince of Wales, eventually to become King George IV, and patronized by everyone who was anyone. And that includes the handsome, mesmerizing George Gordon, Lord Byron, and a bevy of his female admirers.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there, a 15-year-old girl with whom Jane was barely acquainted is murdered, and friends of Jane prevail upon her to look into the matter. As always, Barron includes lots of historical tidbits without slowing down the action. Newcomers will have no problem following the novel, and longtime fans will find their loyalty rewarded.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "One thinks of Jane Austen as a retiring spinster who writes secretly, prefers her privacy and enjoys quiet walks in the Hampshire countryside. Instead, she has applied her intuitive skills of astute observation and deductive reasoning to solve crime in Stephanie Barron’s Austen inspired mystery series. It is an ingenious paradox that would make even Gilbert and Sullivan green with envy. The perfect pairing of the unlikely with the obvious that happens occasionally in great fiction by authors clever enough to pick up on the connection and run with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "marks Stephanie Barron’s tenth novel in the best-selling series. For fourteen years, and to much acclaim, she has channeled our Jane beyond her quiet family circle into sleuthing adventures with lords, ladies and murderers. Cleverly crafted, this historical detective series incorporates actual events from Jane Austen’s life with historical facts from her time all woven together into mysteries that of course, only our brilliant Jane can solve.\n",

      "this was a total impulse \"purchase\" at the library. seconds away from checkout, this wee paperback called to me from the new releases. it seemed a perfect blend of all things i like: jane austen, murder mysteries, and oversexed romantic poets. how could it miss?!?\n",
      "\n",
      "it missed, most obviously, by slavishly developing the historical elements rather than the characters. in fact, by page 50, if she had dropped the words \"jaconet\" or \"salad days\" or \"publickly\" one more time, i was tempted to put the book down. we get it; it's regency. women wear muslin! men wear pantaloons! focus on making jane more dimensional instead of fixating on setting or dress, please,and you'll have yourself a better series.\n",
      "\n",
      "and, yes, i \"get\" that barron is trying to follow the style of austen's novels, and talking about who's who and what they're all wearing is part and parcel of that. but when i picked up this book, i had hoped that it would be a clear deviation from the factual. think: jane austen as a regency nancy drew! unless jane encountered many a dead body in her day, i don't think it should be that hard to do. but going back and forth between adhering staunchly to the historical fact and then dallying in the fantasy is confusing and clunky.\n",

      "i dare say i do not much care for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "the mystery here is fairly blah. the victim is pretty easy to pick out of the early line-up of folks, the murderer even more so, and byron is a deliciously skeevy drunkard. everyone else is sort of interchangeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "the reason jane austen's novels are so popular isn't because they defy predictability or because they solely revolve around character development. austen wrote with a quick wit and a deft hand, and those two traits are difficult to emulate by anyone at any time. when austen wrote about style and fashion, it was to make a comment on her own society. when she added a character, it was to provide a clear service to the text. barron's attempts at mimicry fall painfully short and remind me of fan fiction.\n",

      "I felt so blessed to be able to have been gifted this ARC from the publisher on this one here, I was so thrilled to see that Sparks decided to continue the series, and I didn’t know if she would or not, as there has been a long length of time since the last one in the series “The Siren and the Deep Blue Sea” What we get with this one though, is a continuation of the series that features the children of the couples in the first five books of the Embraced series. I was really fascinated by this one here though, and I adored the cover of this one here too. This was quite an interesting story though, and even though I didn’t quite love it like some of the previous books, it was still a solid story. And it features some fun tropes such as “road trip adventure” and “unrequited love” which are two of my favorites. I don’t get a chance to read road trip adventures too often, but I was in love with the way that this one was written and seeing this romance blossom.\n",

      "Summary\n",
      "Princess Eviana has always felt like the black sheep where her gift is concerned. She is the daughter of Luciana and Leo, but her gift is dangerous and many fear what she would do with it. Even her family has kept her shielded and locked away. But now she is of age to marry and is now able to venture out in the world, Then enters our hero, Quentin, who is valuable but he is also low born and has loved Eviana for years but has stayed in the shadows, yearning for a woman he can never have. But when he reaches out to protect her and reveals the true intents of her suitors at a ball, secrets of the royal family are revealed but becomes a turning point for Eviana to be herself and find the freedom to fly her wings from her overprotective family. When there are suspicious deaths happening and the princess is almost taken captive, Eviana and Quentin begin a journey together in discovering the true intent of the villain, and they discover their enemy wishes to destroy all fo the embraced. That the peace that has been cultivated for years, could be lost. But will Quentin’s secret be revealed in trying to protect her here? Will his love be revealed and when it does will Eviana fight for the man who deserves a HEA just as she does?\n",
      "\n",
      "What I Loved\n",
      "There were so many things to this story that I was all the way in for. I was so stunned by the way that this author wrote this unrequited love. I absolutely adore unrequited love and it was done so well here. And I really respected that Sparks didn’t drag it all the way out. Eviana learns of it and even though there is this forbidden love, with their class difference, Eviana becomes such a fighter for the relationship. She knows what they have together is powerful and worth fighting for. Seeing Eviana go about attempting to court Quentin, was beyond adorable. I understood where Quentin was coming from though. I understand why he didn’t feel he was worthy of her, but Eviana doesn’t see it that way. Quentin has protected her for years and sees who she really is when her own family doesn’t see the power and passion she is capable of and what a leader she is. Quentin understands Eviana and only wants her to break free and show what she is capable of and doesn’t stand in her way when it matters to her. The plot of the story was well done and we do get a POV from the villain so that was really interesting. I was intrigued by the way this story was built and what was hinted at for future books. The romance between Quentin and Eviana was beautiful, and so many sweet and sexy moments were built. The chemistry was well done, but it is more slowly built due to the forbidden nature of the relationship and Quentin being so resistant to them being together. But seeing their HEA and how they achieve it …well it was just BEAUTIFUL IN EVERY WAY!\n",
      "\n",
      "What I Struggled With\n",
      "I will say that the pacing is the only real aspect to this story that could have been improved upon. It’s what kept it from a five-star read for me, it just didn’t quite engage me quite as much as I was expecting considering the last book in the series completely I couldn’t put down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall View\n",
      "When A Princess Proposes was a magnificent read, that combines themes that are built within this fantastical world that Sparks has grown so beautifully. It’s a story of adventure, hidden love, and embracing one’s self!\n",

      "Princess Eviana has been sheltered and overprotected since she gained her powers, which are kept hidden. Isolated and raised to fear her power, Eviana longs for freedom. Quentin is an Embraced spy who has the ability to shift into an eagle. He has loved Princess Eviana for years but is not of noble birth and feels unworthy. Can he keep his feelings in check when he and Eviana, along with two others, travel and work together to find out who is targeting their kind?\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved Eviana and Quentin. They are such layered and interesting characters, and I found both of their stories compelling. Though their lives were very different, they share many of the same feelings about their circumstances. However, their personalities are very different, and there are definite grumpy/sunshine vibes between the two. Eviana is so optimistic, extroverted, and expressive. Quentin is quiet, brooding, and solitary. They seem like opposites, but for some reason, they work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The romance between Aviana and Quentin is slow-building, high angst, and filled with chemistry. The banter between this pair is fabulous. They have so many great conversations, some funny and teasing, and others serious, intimate, and vulnerable, and their love story is fantastic. Of course, their budding relationship is not without its obstacles, both internal and external, especially when it comes to Quentin’s doubt and feelings of unworthiness. I like that Aviana takes charge and fights for what she wants and shows Quentin just how worthy he is. There is another romance in the story that is equally lovely, though it is more of a friends-to-lovers story. The way one finds out about the other’s feelings is super swoon-worthy, and the professions of his feelings throughout the story are fantastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also really liked the secondary characters, especially Lady Olana. She has an amazing gift and is feared by many. Like the protagonists, Olana lives a solitary and lonely life, and I so wanted her to find happiness. The story also includes many of the primary characters from other Embraced books, and I really enjoyed learning what happened to these couples. Since twenty years passed between the last book and this one, you really get to see how their relationships have grown and changed, and they are all wonderful additions to this story.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s another fascinating character, and I don’t want to go into too much detail and spoil anything, but the moral greyness of this person is perfection. I love characters with redemption arcs, and his road to redemption is brave and honorable. I have a feeling we’re going to see a lot more of this Enchanted as the series continues. The character goes through so much in the story, and his realizations and lessons learned are very powerful. I think this character and his arc highlights the nefarious manipulations and abuse of the villains. His story also shows how effective some are at brainwashing and using propaganda for their own personal gain and desire for power.\n",
      "\n",
      "The majority of the story finds Eviana, Quentin, Olana, and one other on an amazing journey where they learn more about themselves, each other, their world, and their enemies. They uncover treacherous plots and are thrust into increasingly dangerous and deadly situations. The suspense and intrigue slowly build to a nail-biting climax, and no one is safe. It’s an exciting romance with magic, action, intrigue, dragons, shifter, unique powers, and an epic romance, and it entertained me from beginning to end. I loved the characters and the romances and can’t wait to read the next book in the series. Thanks so much to Kensington Books, NetGalley, and the author for a copy of the book in exchange for my honest review.\n",

      "I really enjoyed this story, it was a lil something different. I couldn't give it 5 stars because of the poor editing that caused me to have to re-read sentences or fill in words that should have been there. Also there were some parts that were just unrealistic i.e. going in on the connect. Even if ya dad's name rang bells and that's some of where you get your respect from, he's not here anymore. Setting a building on fire to kill someone isn't smart. Killing them then setting the bodies on fire is a better approach. Help might come before they die from smoke inhalation, then what??? I loved the fact that Tyree took that responsibility on no questions asked since he knew he took her virginity. Hated that they used nicknames the whole time. Just my personal peeve. Didn't take away from the story at all. Loved how organically their love grew. Again, great story. Characters could've been a lil more developed. If this is a first time author, you have great potential. Please don't be offended by my comments. They are only intended to help you grow as a storyteller. Blessings.\n",

      "Although the story was good there were a lot of short sentences. I felt the story was rushed as if the author was trying to complete this book. The first few chapters I thought I would just closed the book because as I was reading it I thought it read like a child's book. About the characters, Ro was a college stupid and Tyree owned his own car dealership and both ended up having a one night stand leaving Roxanne pregnant. She was hormonal, depressed, greedy, making irrational mistakes, rude, smart mouth, and feisty. Tyree was straight up rude in the beginning, but became a man about his business. He was supportive, didn't take shit from anyone, he would murder you if you came for his family (Ro & baby).\n",
      "\n",
      "Janiya who was Tyree's girlfriend was stupid. She was 7 years older than Ree and immature. I think she got what she deserve in the end for targeting a pregnant woman. Roxanne's mom should be a shame putting her child out with no where to go,\n",

I didn't believe the fact that his brother in college just gave up his info on how to reach him to a girl he didn't know. She could have been anyone trying to get at him clearly as Jaynae did further in the story. I loved the fact that he was a real man even though he was a thug, he owned up to the fact it was his baby. I found it very hard to believe him being in the streets and not taking precautions with her safety knowing someone was after him. Overall a good read but so many important facts were left out. Her mother making the phone call worried about her then turns around and dismiss her and her unborn again was leaving me hanging.\n",

That was my mane issue like she was doing stupid stuff all because he cheated 1 time ok you could’ve just moved on. Her mom was very extra you either wanna be in her life or don’t. I didn’t like how childish she would act he left you in the house ok you was sleeping. I also wasn’t sure about tyree character I understand your a business man and a respected “thug” but he carried yourself more like a wannabe thug at some points. It was a good book just needed a little more details.\n",

      "This is a series to remember. The kind that will never leave my keeper shelves and will be reread over and over again.\n",
      "IT HAD TO BE YOU is the spectacular conclusion to a thrilling series. Bella and the Rossi clan have thoroughly wormed themselves into my heart and Bella’s hunky cowboy is her perfect match. Bella’s warmth and genuine personality gives all young women (and the young at heart) that a fairy tale love is so very possible.\n",
      "Not one but two weddings are being planned in this fun loving book and the trials are far from over. I love the light hearted spin a normally stressful situation would have. Bella has the remarkable ability to draw the reader in and make them a character right along with her. Nothing sappy about what she does, only a pure and lovable romance.\n",
      "I will miss joining in on the fun and am sorry to see the series come to an end, which in my opinion is the mark of a truly wonderful book- or in this case books. But I take comfort knowing that Bella is only a page turn away, in three of my favorite books of all time, WEDDINGS BY BELLA!!\n",

      "Bella and the rest of the Rossi clan return for a third outing of wedding-fueled hilarity in It Had to Be You, the final novel in Janice Thompson’s “Weddings by Bella” series. Bella’s beloved Aunt Rosa and Uncle Laz have finally foregone constant feuding in favor of marriage, and tasked Bella with planning an elaborate forties-themed wedding, complete with live swing music. Several long-distance members of the Rossi family descend on the household for the celebration, complicating the wedding preparations with their own personal drama and opinions. When a former mob boss is added to the mix who disapproves of the bride-to-be, Bella’s best friend disappears, and interest in Club Wed explodes, Bella wonders if plans for her own dream wedding to her cowboy fiancé D.J. will be lost in the drama and busyness of everyone else’s lives. In order to make her own happily ever after come true, Bella has one final lesson to learn about trust and control in order to step fearlessly into her future, full of faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "With It Had to Be You, Thompson brings Bella’s story full circle. There have been times when Bella’s character has been a bit frustrating, since she never seems to move past the insecurities that plague her perception of herself and her abilities. But she’s seen both personal and professional success on the wedding front, since Club Wed brought D.J. into her life and his support has been integral to both the business’s success and Bella’s growing confidence as a wedding planner. When it comes time to realize her own bridal dreams, Bella finally learns a valuable lesson – that receiving can be as much of a gift as giving, and true freedom can be found in relinquishing control to a God one can trust to guide your steps. But more than Bella’s story, this is a trilogy about family, and all of the ups, downs, drama and love that comes with the territory of belonging to a group of unique and varied personalities. The Rossis are truly the Italian version of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, with all of the family love and drama grounded by a rock-solid Christian faith. While this installment feels a bit preachier than volumes one and two, fans of the series will not want to miss a third helping of Thompson’s trademark warmth and humor.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is as breezy and fast-paced a read as the first two novels in the “Bella” series. It’s critical to read the series in order, since the events of each subsequent book follow closely on its predecessor. One of my favorite elements of this story is how the family’s love of pop standards takes center stage thanks to the theme of Rosa and Laz’s wedding. I loved reading about the planning involved in bringing my favorite time period to life for two characters who’ve been so much fun to read about throughout the series. Speaking of Rosa and Laz, I really appreciate how Thompson doesn’t limit love and marriage to the younger characters alone. In Bella’s life, people of all ages, sizes, and backgrounds fall in love left and right in this series, just one of the reasons that make this trilogy such a joy to read. A large part of the series’ appeal is the characters’ appreciation of classic song – and like the classics of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, the Rossi family virtues of unconditional love, forgiveness, and support endure and make you want to spend time with Bella and her whacky family. It Had to Be You is a satisfying conclusion to the frothy fun and heart of the “Weddings by Bella” series. Once you start reading, you won't want to stop - and I can promise you'll be craving Italian food. :)\n",

      "This was the fifth book I've read by this author, and I loved it every bit as much as all the others! It was so great to finally read the next installment in Bella and D.J.'s story! I knew what to expect from a Janice Thompson book, a fun story with quirky characters, that will have me rolling on the floor laughing while at the same time inspiring me and bringing me into a closer and deeper relationship with The Lord! And this one definitely did not disappoint on any of those counts! Overall, I loved this book and highly recommend it as well as the rest of the series, this is definitely a series that is best read in order.\n",

      "ironically, this book really stressed me out. there was so much, \"okay, you are a parent & your life is just so hectic between laundry & work & getting your kids to soccer & helping with homework & making time to connect with your partner...\". obviously some of these things are not relevant to me because my baby is just a baby & therefore not yet playing soccer or doing homework. but i was like, \"whoa, is this what's on the horizon for me? i thought i was doing okay-ish with this mom thing, but maybe it just snowballs as the kid gets older & eventually i'll be totally overwhelmed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "it's worth noting that this book is pretty irrelevant to people who only have babies. it's definitely for parents of older kids...elementary school age, as far as i can tell. which is fine. kids are in elementary school for a lot longer than they are babies, & in my experience, parenting a baby is really just a long process of attending to basic needs & there's not much to simplify/minimalize there.\n",
      "\n",
      "this book was docked points for the incredibly played \"put your oxygen mask on first\" metaphor. people who write about parenting: STOP IT WITH THE OXYGEN MASK. they also use the phrase \"inner bus driver\" a lot, which grated on my nerves. i think i must have been spacing out when they explained what they even meant by that. obviously they mean \"follow your instincts\" or whatever, but it was such an incomprehensible turn of phrase given that a bus driver has a proscribed route to follow & doesn't get to follow his/her instincts even if there's a different route that s/he thinks might be faster/more scenic/whatever.\n",
      "\n",
      "but probably my biggest complaint is that a lot of their tips for simplifying & minimalizing sound like they are a fuck of a lot of work. setting up apps (i still don't know how to use apps...i'm one thousand years old), spreadsheets, filing systems, color-coded folders or basket systems, etc etc etc...i was exhausted just reading these suggestions. maybe i'm an incompetent adult. it's kind of like this book was about how to be the best type A perfectionist at the game of being minimalist! i mean, obviously a person could just pick & choose the tips that are most relevant or resonant to them. there's no rule that you have to do everything the authors suggest. but it was still overwhelming.\n",

      "When I sat down to start reading this book I told my husband, \"I'm not sure why I'm going to read this. I already do the bare minimum.

      "I don't want to be rude, but this book really should be called No-brainer Parenting and Common Sense Life Management. I am by no means an expert on parenting (hello - that's why I read parenting books), and I'm sorry to say that 98% of the 'wisdom' shared by the authors was either something I already knew (by common sense or by virtue of being an adult) or had already read on a blog or magazine article.\n",

And because of that, I had high expectations. I needed pretty much everything to hit the mark especially since of the three ARC reads prior to it, I only finished 1. I was desperate for a homerun. Of all the different dynamics within the mafia world, the \"paid to carry his heir\" thing wasn't one I'd yet to experience. I wasn't too sure how it would work out without being a little cringey. I was completely blown away with just how well it did work. I loved so many aspects of Nicole's writing & this story that it would take forever to list them.

Little does he know that Camille is desperate for the money, with a chronically ill mother & a drug & gambling addict little brother. Its just a business transaction, no romance & no reason for her to know what he does.

Because there is more than one person outside their mansion walls wanting to claim the throne, & its going to take both the King & his Queen to fight their enemies. This does end in a HEA.

      "A slightly bizarre and beautifully written story. I read André Alexis’ work for his prose, and this book had so many lovely passages in it.\n",
      "While on the surface a story about a man, Alfred Homer, agreeing to accompany family friend Professor Booth while he hunts for information about an Ontario poet John Skennen, it’s also about the odd people and places they meet on their eight-day driving trip, and how the time profoundly transforms Alfred.\n",
      "Though nothing obviously terrible happens during their travels (except for a dog attacking Alfred) I found the story became darker and darker each new place they stopped at. Each town seemed a little odder, whether due to its rituals or its people, transforming the towns into something either strange or savage, all described in lovely prose.\n",
      "(I liked how Alexis also brought one of his own books, , into this story, even having Alfred and Booth meet the model for that book’s main character, who complained about that book’s effect on his life.)\n",
      "I don’t always understand exactly what Alexis is exploring in his novels, but I love his use of language, and how his stories skirt the line between fiction and the fantastic, of which this book was a good example.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A woman I used to know once told me a story about going to Mexico for the first time, never having studied Spanish, but suddenly discovering that she understood the language. She then became fluent in one week.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel as if I'm in a similar story reading this book, my second by André Alexis. I've never had an affinity for mythology or poetry, I'm not Canadian and am unfamiliar with the political or cultural idiosyncrasies, but I found myself mesmerized, understanding references beyond what I remember reading. And even if I missed the root source of some of the material, I had no problem understanding it like a language I've privately spoken forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The novel starts like a realistic story: a young man, a botanist, agrees to accompany a professor on an odyssey to research the life of a poet. But very quickly this becomes a modern-day myth with references to ancient ones (the botanist's name is Alfie Homer), and the sandwiching of Greek mythology with a modern story, plus the general zaniness, sometimes makes this hilarious. Other times, it was like finding a map to my life and psyche, and therefore it became an ocean of something I sank deep into, staying as open as I could to absorb whatever wisdom and life acceptance might be there for me in my idiosyncratic life in New York City. Over and over, I had moments when I suddenly felt clear, as if I'd awakened from a dream. And I think this might be the experience of any reader who is on a lifelong quest—call it spiritual, self-awareness, or whatever you like—to understand what we're doing here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writing is understatedly wonderful; you have to notice—it never shouts, \"Look at literary me!\" So that gives a regular reader (one not well-versed in mythology) a connection. I'm sure I could (and may) read this book many times and keep understanding it differently. But for this first reading what penetrated most was our human inability to ever really see things without projections of our own. And how if our projections are somehow shattered by the reality of the person we are projecting onto, we lose interest; or if we are the object of somebody's projections, the kiss of death can be insisting that we are not who they see. [\"I'd hate to have my image of him (the poet the professor is researching) destroyed by facts, (132)\" says the professor at the prospect of actually meeting the man whose life he is chasing.] Or, if we willingly shatter our own projections, there is the possibility of something privately numinous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing this ridiculous quest as the norm was oddly a relief. While reading, I often felt myself surrendering the fight for perfection—perfect knowing, being perfectly known—and it always is a relief to stop trying to do something that is futile . . . and instead allow the shattering, sometimes lonely, unknowing to direct us. (And if you choose this third option, this book is very good company.)\n",

      "“Having experienced what I did, it seemed to me that religion - its language, biblical advice, sacred ritual, and so on - was insignificant to the universe. I now felt that the universe is and that one is and that sermons, prayers, and vows were all an outdated way of pointing to the depths you could not reach.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In Days by Moonlight, readers are treated to the story of an unusual road trip abound southern Ontario, as told from the perspective of the book’s easy-going main character, Alfred Homer. The narrator makes several references to the trip as a journey into the underworld, and as you get into the meat of the novel, it becomes clear that this underworld is one of Canadian identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexis touches on religion, economics, racism, and even Canadian sexuality in a way that is mostly comical and satirical, but also endearing on occasion. It’s difficult to classify into a particular genre, but it is definitely a critique of Canadian identity that I won’t soon forget. I adore Alexis’ writing style and I look forward to reading more of his books.\n",

      "Thank you to NetGalley and Coach House Books for the ARC. I thought it was great!\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Beneath these small impressions, there was something deeper. I could feel the flow of that particularly Canadian thing: passion brought on by outrage. Outrage seeped into the Wolf and Pendulum and permeated the place: an outrage that turned, at times, to aggression, an aggression that few of those in the pub would have permitted themselves unless prompted by their sense of political imbalance – the fate of the poor, distant committees dictating to those who lived in Nobleton. In the Wolf and Pendulum, I recognized what you could call a “Canadian instinct” or, if you were being unkind, a Canadian addiction: moral reproach.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I do think that stands on its own as an unsettling and intriguing piece of fiction that does more than most books to explore and expose the Canadian psyche, it's more important to consider it as part of André Alexis' “quincunx” project: a series of five novels, revolving around similar themes, that will ultimately interconnect like the pips on a die showing a five. Once again, I'll let Alexis explain the project that came to him as he attempted, and repeatedly failed, to rewrite Pier Paolo Passolini's :\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So far in the project, is the, er, pastoral, is the apologue, is the quest narrative, is the ghost story, and they've already begun to intersect in interesting ways: some dogs from appeared in , and characters from go to Barrow (the setting of ), and not only has one of the characters read , but they meet the priest that that book's main character was based on and he disputes his portrayal. In each of these books, Alexis makes statements in an afterword that I have found helpful for understanding his intent, and for this book, he lists the great travel novels that he found inspirational (from Dante's to ) and writes, “ is not a work of realism. It’s not a work that uses the imagination to show the real, but one that uses the real to show the imagination.” And that's truly the essence of this book, right there. So what's it about?\n",
      "\n",
      "Alfred Homer is a young Botanist who has recently experienced a twin set of griefs and is invited by an old friend of his father's to accompany him on a brief road trip across Southern Ontario. This Professor Bruno intends to follow the trail of an obscure poet about whom he is writing a book, and knowing that there are some interesting horticultural specimens to be observed along the way, Homer agrees to be driver and companion on the quest. Because they are both travelling and interviewing people who knew the poet, this narrative is a mixture of the pair witnessing strange events – a community of Black people who don't speak during daylight hours, a visit to the Museum of Canadian Sexuality – and listening to fantastical stories – about witches, demons, and ghostly visitations. Much of what is witnessed is satirical in nature – in a way that does reveal essential truths about what it is to be Canadian – and the majority of the conversations are about art and truth and metaphysical belief – in a way that does reveal essential truths about what it is to be human. There's a packed into this small volume, and for the first time, I'm really getting a sense for the quincunx.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a personal note: I enjoyed that this book travelled to places that I'm familiar with. In particular, I have never seen Stouffville – a tiny rural community where I lived for seven years as a child – in a novel before, and while I'd agree with Homer's assessment that it's “like any number of towns in the area”, I had to wonder why only residents spoke like yokels, “I don't think youse are going to get much out of Gram. She hasn't been herself lately, eh?” (But as Alexis says in the afterword that these towns are “exaggeratedly, or (even) perversely portrayed”, I'm not actually taking offense. At least I'm not from .)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to need to read all four of these books again before the fifth comes out; this feels like a truly remarkable project; truly .\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Alfred Homer's just trying to put his past behind him. He's lost both his parents to a car accident and his lover has just left him. So he joins his parent's friend, Professor Morgan Bruno, on the hunt for information on poet John Skennen that will take them both across Southern Ontario.\n",
      "\n",
      "And while the small towns of Schomberg, Feversham, New Tecumseth and Coulson's Hill are all actual locations in Ontario, what awaits the pair in the book is another thing altogether. They encounter towns peopled by blacks that speak only in sign language, annual house burning lotteries, ridiculous Indigenous parades, witches, werewolves and the Museum of Canadian Sexuality.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's all a deep metaphor! It sound exhausting and self-important when I put it like that, but Days by Moonlight proves to be a dreamy odyssey propelled by Alexis' lyrical writing that glides effortlessly from one story to the next. It avoids feeling didactic and self-important in favour of a bucolic, certainly skewed but confidently Canadian road trip. All that's missing is a Timmy's double-double for the ride and roadside poutine stops.\n",

      "Ahhh, reading in the bath.\n",

      "Everyone has their favorite kinks. As some of you may know (those that pay attention to the nonsense I blurt out of my face), I am drawn to some specific kinks in the BDSM realm, namely domestic discipline, daddy kink, chastity, and humiliation kink. I actually cringe reading about flogging or whipping, and tying someone up does nothing for me. I get why some people love certain things, but a lot of those things are not for me and I don't love reading about them.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you analyze it further, all of my kinks are in the power control category. I just like it when someone has control over else that has nothing to do with pain or restraints. With domestic disciple, the idea that someone else is in charge and is keeping you in line feels just so... freeing, in a way. Now, in real life I don't think I could handle that, but I TOTALLY get the desire and it is very easy for me to get into a DD character's headspace.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found both main characters to be really, really interesting. The beginning was a little hard to read. Anyone could recognize the signs of an abusive relationship between Scott and Aiden, but I liked how the author made it a slow progression, like a real abusive relationship, so that we saw why Aiden was sucked in. I wanted to save him soooo badly, but it set the stage nicely for Aiden and Keaton's relationship. Keaton was a great guy. He was patient, loving, and gentle, and he took his role as a partner and DD top very seriously. I liked how he let things sort of evolve between him and Aiden and didn't push him too quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did have some minor complaints. For one, Aiden was almost unbearably bratty at times, and I thought that he acted too immature at certain parts of the story. Also, I didn't get the weird personality shifts in Scott. I didn't find him acceptable in any way, and I wasn't sure if the author was trying to set up a future book with him as the MC so she decided redeem him a bit. It was odd.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this book is a very quick, lovely read about the journey to a DD relationship. All DD fans should try this one.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is an unusal BDSM-themed book. Keaton is into domestic discipline, not BDSM. Keaton is looking for a nurturing relationship of equals, supported by corporal and other punishments. This was an interesting twist on a familiar genre, and I enjoyed it. I didn't find it hot in the least, but I did find the emotionally caring aspect of Keaton and Aiden's relationship very sweet and calming.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was taken a bit aback when I started the book, because I assumed the sample I read (when Aiden is living with Keaton) was the beginning, and that the author was not going to spell out the abusive BDSM relationship that Aiden had with Scott prior to Keaton. I liked this idea as an approach; picking up from the aftermath and letting the reader piece it all together. However the sample is actually from half way through the book, so I did in fact have to sit through the abusive relationship first. This made me sad, because it wasn't BDSM, it was a horrible, abusive and damaging power imbalance. I wanted to give Aiden a hug and take him far far away.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is also unusual in being the first book I ever read (m/m genre or otherwise) where an enema is administered to actually treat constipation. It's definitely the first m/m romance I ever read that even mentions constipation.\n",
      "\n",
      "One down point is that it wasn't very long: I read fast, but I was done in just on two hours. For $6.99 that was a little disappointing. I would have liked more about Aiden and Keaton's relationship: it was a bit too much telling and not enough showing.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, for a change from the more usual BDSM-theme I recommend it.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Maybe Domestic Discipline just isn’t my thing because this didn’t work for me. The relationship between Keaton and Aiden was odd. Keaton is more like a parent to Aiden than his lover or Dom. He had Aiden writing lines, gave him time out and he just sucked all the fun and kink out of spanking. I didn’t like either MC. Keaton was boring and Aiden acted like a five year old most of the time. They did have their sweet moments but it wasn’t enough to convince me that this relationship really has a future.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I've gotta go up to 4.5 stars on this one - it truly was that good.\n",
      "What a fantastic story! The characters were amazing and the pacing was perfect. over 300 pages and they just flew by - really highly recommend this book.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This book was a bit Jekyll and Hyde for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found the first half of it almost unbearable to read and came pretty close to DNF'ing it but was too curious to see how Aiden was going to get himself out of the hell he was in to stop reading. I guess this was just too hardcore for me, the barrage of degredation and humilation just felt endless and hopeless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aiden's reason for finally leaving Scott just felt inauthentic and forced, just as his reasons for staying. Those few times that Scott was shown to be a sympathetic character just didn't work for me and felt like an artificial attempt to give him layers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I picked up this book for the domestic discipline storyline. I've read other books with that subject matter and have really enjoyed them. While I did enjoy the second half of the book better with Keaton it still had problems for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aiden just felt too much like a completely different character to me, for him to go from extreme pain slut to brat was just confusing. The whole brat concept does work for me but I had a hard time relating that to what I knew of Aiden from the first half of the book. Keaton didn't come as a strong top either and he almost seemed to be playing the role as much as Aiden did in his earlier club roles. Knowing kind of what he wanted but ultimately not strong enough to make me believe things will work out with the two of them in the end. Sometimes the relationship worked for me and other times Aiden pulled the strings too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "This just didn't end up being a book that I enjoyed. There were concepts and moments that I liked but ultimately the extreme D/s of the first half and the tentative domestic discipline of the second just felt too at odds with each other to make for a cohesive whole.\n",

      "Honestly, the book cover is horrendous. But I enjoyed the story very much. The theme is alpha control over his omega that runs away, blah, blah, blah; the plot doesn't get boring because we enjoy it that much. The alpha is a general and he acts like one to his lover. I believe the setting is in a post apocalypse, fantastical, dystopian society that reversed to a medieval era. The story is mostly about her alpha and the omega that tries to save her people by challenging him.\n",

      "That’s a big No-No.\n",
      "Usually an alpha would reprimand her at some point, but Zeus doesn’t appear to be that dominant, and matter of fact he lets her get away with way to much dictation. It only seems to kick much much much later near the end of the book.\n",

And I enjoyed the mystery, which reminded me a bit of something out of Murder She Wrote in terms of the amount of actual danger our heroine is in. I also loved all the library humor. Go figure! This read will appeal to fans of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels and Elaine Viets' dead-end-job series.\n",

      "I have read a few books on mindfulness and meditation, and typically find them educational and constructive in helping me develop my own practice. This book not so much. It was a short read, however not engaging in the least, and the story of living as a Samurai, which I thought would be so interesting, was definitely not.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last 6 or so summary pages are the highlight of the book and the only real value I got out of it. I feel very cynical about this book, as others said it was great, but for me it was far from it. Wish I had $16.98 back.\n",

      "I hate to give a book one star. It's like a failure on my part. Somewhere, someone exists who needs this book. There is a good article on meditation hidden in this book. A decent article on meditation. Hidden. So well hidden in passages about the elite samurai. Not the ordinary, plebian samurai. Hidden in the pseudo science, hidden in the actual science used to make questionable claims that lead us to conclusions that don't really make any sense. Just don't.\n",

      "I have been practicing traditional forms of meditation like chanting the mantra, focusing on breath etc. However, after coming across TEM I realized that I can meditate with my eyes wide open, 24 hours a day (During work as well) with wide range of benefits. The book is very well written and is easy to understand. Most importantly the techniques in each chapter followed by practice exercises impressed me a lot.\n",

      "My life has transformed significantly after practicing this meditation. The first and very important realization I had is to realize that I am not my body, I am not even my mind. I am pure consciousness or awareness using this body and mind to perceive this world. This meditation is helping me to be absolutely aware of present moment irrespective of situation I am in. Because of this awareness, I am able to understand/perceive concepts better and in depth during my work. Because of this awareness, I am able to solve problems better in my work and suggest better ideas in team meetings. My productivity has increased a lot in my work. I am able to respond with my ture heart during difficult times with difficult people (Instead of reacting in a bad way)\n",

      "After practicing this, I was able to merge with oneness (Universal consciousness) , I am feeling less stressed during my work.

I honestly believe that I am really lucky to come across this mediation in my life.\n",

      "I liked the author’s unique take on meditation and his presentation of this new way of looking at meditation outside the usual concentration methods. His focus on the five senses, and ultimately using 'spherical' body awareness as the final step in meditation, really has some positive points and actually works (in calming the mind and offering a new perspective to live from). He also includes some very useful information on general lifestyle supporting tips, such as diet, environment, etc. The book as a whole was about the right length. I really liked the appendix and explanations at the end of the book. Worth a read/listen for anyone interested in different meditation techniques and perspectives.\n",

      "\n",
      "This book revolutionized how I think about meditation. I used to think it was something that needed ideal conditions to truly master (e.g., quiet room, sitting down), but now I see that this was a limited mindset as to the true capabilities that meditation offers us. The fact that meditation can be practiced in virtually any setting and time, including while reading, was an eye-opener for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have read other books on meditation, but this one was by far the most practical handbook for actually applying meditation in one’s life. The steps are very helpful as a guide to get you started, but you can also transform what the book offers into your own unique meditative experience. All the tools are included to help you do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt that Richard Haight was my personal trainer with his personable writing style – it was a highly enjoyable read. Also, there was much more depth as to discussing different forms of meditation that I had never heard of in other books or in online articles. I certainly did feel that I was learning “secret” techniques from an expert, and I was glad the author chose to reveal them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am someone who has read about 400 books, and this is one of the most enlightening books I have read. Many books will scratch at the surface of what the true problem is with many of us anxious, overworked, overstressed humans. For many of us, perhaps a root cause is simply that we exercise one type of being and awareness 99% of the time, and ignore another side to ourselves entirely. That other side is what this book will help with – feeling more in tuned with nature, more aware, more at ease and relaxed, ready to handle anything without the stress. Our minds need a break from the rigid, high-stressed and focused states that we tend to be in all day – meditation is one path to accomplish this.\n",
      "\n",
      "There usually is not one panacea to living a good life, and so I appreciated that the author touched on some other aspects of living a good life, such as healthy eating and paying attention to our emotional states. This is quite a holistic book to helping promote your wellbeing and to overcome the problems of your life.\n",

      "I read these poems via Serial Reader, which actually turned out to be a good way to make sure I really paid attention. Sometimes, if I try to read a book of poetry at a single sitting, I find that they start to just blur past me. This way, I had more concentration for each individual poem, which helped me appreciate them more. Emily Dickinson isn’t my favourite poet, and I really wanted to give her work a chance.\n",

      "I did enjoy some of these poems, but for me the regularity of the poems is a downside. I do enjoy highly structured poetry at times — I love villanelles, for example! — but with a simple form and those constant rhyming couplets, it felt almost trite to me. Possibly because Dickinson’s poetry is quoted a lot, but even the ones I didn’t know at all… I don’t know, simple a/b/a/b rhyme schemes really bore me. Alas.\n",

      "As a half human, half vampire and the only daughter of the Romanian Carpathian Fortress, Kaitlyn Sherrad has lived a very sheltered life. Now at twenty one, she has finished college and convinced her parents to let her stay in America and try to make her own way in Nevada. Late one night Kaitlyn meets Zack Ravenscroft, a local casino owner, who immediately sweeps her off her feet. Little do they both know they have more in common then they think and their similarities just might make their romance forbidden.\n",
      "As a six hundred year old vampire Zack Ravenscroft never thought he would find a woman to spend his life and as one of The Order, vampires who are made not born, his relationship with Kaitlyn is forbidden and her father is hell bent on keeping them apart. Zack must now fight for his relationship not only against the woman that he loves family but against an old enemy who has come back for revenge and has chosen Kaitlyn as their target. Zack and Kaitlyn must now prove to everyone that they deserve love and happiness together and they will do anything or fight anyone to attain it.\n",
      "Bound by Blood is the second book in Amanda Ashley’s Bound Series and it picks up twenty one years after Bound by Night leaves off which is the story of Kaitlyn’s mother and father, Elena and Drake. This book was much better then the first in the series, which I previously reviewed, but I found it to be very boring and uneventful. I think that to really understand what is going on in this story you would need to read the first book or else you will be very confused as the two books have very interwoven plot lines.\n",
      "I had a few problems with this book but I think the thing that bothers me the most is how fast Kaitlyn and Zack meet and fall in love. There is no big anticipation at all with their relationship and after the first hundred pages they are in love, going to get married and the book moves on to the person who is trying to get revenge on Kaitlyn’s family. I disliked the Romeo and Juliet parallel a lot and found that the forbidden romance between the two to be an opening for Kaitlyn to whine and complain a lot.\n",
      "Kaitlyn reminded me very much of her mother from the first book and this is not a compliment. I found her to be very spoiled, boring, a goody-goody, highly annoying and lacking any sort of backbone. I very much dislike weak female leads and Kaitlyn is the poster child for weak female leads. The only woman who had any sort of guts was portrayed as the villain while the meek, crawl into a corner and wait for the men to save them woman are the heroins. At one point a male character told a female that if she didn’t do what he said he would “Lock her in her room.” I’m sorry what? These two are supposed to be in love for years and are married and he’s going to lock her in her room like a child? These are just not the sort of characters that I like reading about. The male characters are okay but nothing special.\n",
      "I found most of this book to be very bad and I found myself rolling my eyes a lot. I think the action is very good but the romance is lacking and so are the characters. I was very excited to read this series and highly disappointed. Plain and simple, as far as paranormal romances go this isn’t a very good one and I can’t recommend it as a fan of the genre.\n",

      "Kaitlyn Sherrad, the daughter of Drake and Elena came to the states for college. But she loved California and decided she wanted to stay for a few more years until she had to return home to look for a mate. She settles near Lake Tahoe, and finds herself enjoying a home of her own and despite all that has been extended to her, Kaitlyn is bored out of her mind. So she goes to a Casino in the area, and finds herself drawn to Zack Ravenscroft, the owner. Zack, is a vampire and loves the night and is having a fun time interacting with others at his casino especially the women. Zack finds Kaitlyn irrisistable and wants to know more of her. He is not sure why he feels so connected to her, but he is eager to find out what they can become. But there is a threat to Kaitlyn's life, and her father interferes right when Zack and Kaitlyn start to fall in love with one another. Zack is forced to prove himself to the father because in Drake's eyes Zack is his mortal enemy, but Zack isn't afraid of Drake but is willing to do whatever it takes to make Kaitlyn his, even if that means humbling himself before a vampire younger than he is. The enemy is out for revenge and will do anything to destroy the Sherrad family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zack Ravenscroft, was turned into a vampire. He is considered one of the \"others\". Zack is a honorable man. He was turned against his will, and was left on his own as a newly turned vampire 600 years previous. Zack has experience and despite his vast years of living, has only turned one vampire himself. Zack has come to accept who he is and goes out of his way to help others when he can. Zack is a hero I came to admire so highly, and boy is he tough as nails but can be as soft as a cuddly bear at times. Zack is charismatic and entertaining and knows how to flirt his way through any situation. There were so many aspects of his character I loved, but what I admired the most is the way he treats Kaitlyn and the way he treats her father with respect but stands his own ground without pushing too many buttons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kaitlyn Sherrad has been protected and loved by everyone that has ever known her. Kaitlyn couldn't harm a ant, and she accepts everyone for who they are. Kaitlyn is close to her parents, but also wants to pave her own life in her own time but she also understands her duties, as being her father's only heir and child. Kaitlyn was a heroine I liked from the beginning. She is kind and open, and doesn't have a mean bone in her body. But she has a spine of steel and when it truly matters, she stands for what she thinks is right no matter the consequences. This is what I loved most about this heroine, was her ability to take charge and stand by the man she loves despite how much she loves her parents. She sees what needs to be done and does it. She gets impatient at times, and can be impulsive but I found her character charming and fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the second book to this duo series, and what a ball of fun I had with this one. I loved it even more than the first one and I was pretty anxious to read it. Probably because I didn't know what to expect with it, but Amanda Ashley has surpassed herself in writing this one. I just couldn't get enough, and I was so sad to see it end mostly due to the fact that I loved Zack and Kaitlyn together and seeing all the secondary characters that were in the first book and I loved the way they all come together in the end. This is a story about the test of true love . These two hit it off pretty quickly at the beginning, and spend every waking moment together once they fully connect. But right when their relationship is going great (it obviously can't stay that way right??) the father and uncle grab Kaitlyn and take her away when they learn that there is a threat against her life, a very serious one. This threat is connected to the first book. In the first book, Kaitlyn's grandfather was called upon to fight for his territory that he held for over a thousand years and was betrayed and killed by his own son. Drake (Kaitlyn's father) was his father second and was forced to kill his own brother. The mother of the brother killed is out for revenge and boy this woman is bat shit crazy. I mean mentally, she is insane with the need for vengeance and will do anything to get it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can understand Drake's need to protect his only child, a daughter he has cherished. But Drake goes a bit overboard with his protectiveness. Kaitlynn is a bit naive for a couple of moments, because in reality she wasn't told the whole truth and doesn't fully realize the danger she is in. But Kaitlyn is furious when she is taken away from the man she loves. But she knows that she is about to be put in a terrible position, but dang does she hold her own with her father. Now this is where Zack steps in. He follows her to Europe and lets just say that Drake and Zack are at odds with one another. This is a changing point in the story and is very vital to what follows. Drake is out of his mind with his actions, and I will admit I really had problems with him for the first time since reading the first book in this duo series. He is out of line in the actions he takes against Zack. It takes Elena and Kaitlyn, working together to convince him that he may lose his daughter if he isn't careful in his treatment of Zack. What I found the most endearing, was seeing the way Zack and Kaitln fight for one another and what loyalty they have for each other...it just about broke my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was so fun about this story was the romance that blossoms between the two,. Now this isn't your typical vampire romance where sex happens quickly. In fact its the exact opposite and I LOVED that. It was so refreshing to see a hero that isn't out for just sex all the time. He finds something real with Kaitlyn and he wants to prove how special she is to him. Kaitlyn was so amusing in the ways she goes out to seduce Zack and only gets some good hot kisses in return. And boy is she hilarious when she is sexually frustrated. hehe I really respected how Zack treats Kaitlyn. You can tell he really wants to make love to her, but he wants to wait until its the right time and not \"down the hall\" from her father. He wants full commitment from Kaitlyn before he sleeps with her. I know its not the \"modern\" idea or concept, but its so rare to find a hero like this and I adored every moment. But even though they don't fully go all the way, they do explore and build up the tension quite well. I also liked how Amanda Ashley makes sure all the ends are tied, and by the ending you see a solid close to a fantastic duo series. We have many factors involved in the story, but they all fit perfectly with each other and loved the blend of paranormal, suspense, mystery and passion.\n",

      "I am getting hooked on this narrator. She has such a likable voice, and really makes the story come alive for the listener. From the beginning I liked her, but now after two books I am LOVING her.\n",

      "Zackery Ravenscroft is a made vampire. Sired over 600 years earlier, Zack is a successful casino and hotel owner in Las Vegas. Money and women are no object, but finding the mysterious Kaitlyn Sherrad in the once empty cabin, peaks his curiousity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kaitlyn’s family of vampires has long been at war with the ‘Others’-the made vampires. Liking them to vermin, the made vampires are stereotyped and discriminated to the point of death. And Kaitlyn knows her relationship with Zack will never be accepted by her family especially her father and his kin. But when a threat against his daughter by his extended family moves Drake to bring Kaitlyn home to Romania, Zack takes it upon himself to search for the woman who has stolen his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nadiya is one of Drake’s father’s wives. Following the death of her husband and one of her son’s, Nadiya seeks revenge. And the only course of action is to take from Drake what he took from her-a child. Targeting Kaitlyn is easy, but gaining access is harder. Several failed attempts resulting in the death of more of her sons, Nadiya finds a common foe in Lucien. Lucien has always wanted control of the Carpathian coven and it was a risk he was slightly reluctant to take. Knowing he would have to stand up to Drake, Lucien accepts Drake’s challenge, but soon realizes that he is involved in something far more dangerous than a Coven coup.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Zack and Kaitlyn’s relationship progresses, Drake’s unease about the made vampire tempers. Zack’s love for Kaitlyn is obvious, but made-vampires have always been the enemy-the Others-and not accepted by Drake’s kind. When Zack and Kaitlyn announce their engagement, it is Elena who will remind her husband, that he too fell in love with an ‘outsider’-a human.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nadiya’s continued attempts to exact revenge against her husband’s family, places Kaitlyn, and the others on constant alert. But a phone call from Vegas telling him his casino and hotel have been destroyed in a deliberate fire, finds Zack back in the USA trying to discover who was responsible for the destruction. Suspecting it was one of Nadiya’s sons, Drake and Zack must take extra precautions while preparing for the wedding. And knowing that Nadiya will never stop until Kaitlyn is dead, nothing would surprise Zack leading up to their wedding day. And in the end, there will be a newly-made vampire that will have to be accepted –because love does conquer all.\n",
      "BOUND BY BLOOD is a romantic tale between a vampire and his mate. The attraction is instant but I had concerns that these characters were not able to identify each other as vampires. With their heightened senses, I would have thought that identification would have been immediate as was the attraction, but in the end, it didn’t matter. The writing is simple and the plot was easy to follow. The relationship and story progress without the use of foul language or graphic sex. I am looking forward to the next story-perhaps Uncle Stefan has found love-afterall.\n",

In the past all Amanda's old vampires have been very well written and mature, but something is very off about Zach. And the way he suddenly picks up calling her darlin' like he's southern or something I found quite odd.\n",

This may be a good story, I'll never know because the aforementioned word is used once every 5 minutes or so. Editors, please encourage your authors to eliminate unnecessary words. You don't need to refer to a vampire's powers as preternatural. It's understood. Vampires are powerful and paranormal. we already know this.\n",

      "The purpose of Newport’s How to Be a High School Superstar is to change the student’s perspective on high school life and college admissions. Newport gives you useful advice concerning what college admissions are impressed by and enlightens the reader regarding certain myths about college requirements. He tells the readers steps to enjoying your high school years while getting accepted into your preferred college. For example, Newport says, “(1) Pack your schedule with free time. (2) Use this time to explore. (3) Master one serious interest. Don’t waste time on unrelated activities. (4) Pursue accomplishments that are hard to explain, not hard to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The theme of this novel is quality over quantity. Newport reveals that doing a cluster of unrelated activities that you are not passionate about does not impress colleges and will not benefit you overall. He believes stressed students with no free time will not be rewarded for their demanding schedule. He advises readers to do find what they are passionate about and focus on that particular interest. For college admissions, the quality of their work in doing what they enjoy will far outweigh the quantity of multiple half-hearted activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author’s style of writing is an exposition. It is an exposition because he is establishing facts about a topic to bring clarity to his idea. An example of this style of writing is when Newport tells the story of a girl named Kara. She has a meeting with her guidance counselor, who tells her that her grades (B’s) aren’t good enough to get into Stanford. Then he tells us, “Kara did get in. In fact, Kara go into twenty of the twenty-one schools she applied to, including MIT, Caltech, Columbia, Cornell, Berkeley, John Hopkins, and, of course, Stanford—proving, to the surprise of her counselor, that those schools do occasionally accept students with B’s.” This style of writing is effective because using specific examples and facts help the readers become convinced by any idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed this nonfiction book because it informed me on how to get into your preferred college, which I believe will affect my entire life. I admired how the book had examples of students who succeeded using this technique. I would not change anything about this novel. How to Be a High School Superstar is unlike anything I have ever read because it introduced an idea that I never considered.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I agree with the central thesis of the book: High school students are over-involved in uninteresting activities at which they are merely good, and thus they need to choose one or two genuine, innovative pursuits to bolster their college admissions chances. However, the road to the kind of achievement Newport promotes isn't available to most students for various reasons (socioeconomic status, personality preferences, etc.). Essentially, by following the map he lays out, talented, intelligent, and hardworking students will be able to keep being talented, intelligent and hardworking students, but at Yale instead of UConn. Obviously, there's a market for that kind of advice, and Newport has done well by himself to make use of it. Unfortunately, I don't think this is a work that has much usefulness for the majority of high school students.\n",

      "This is one of those books where you might roll your eyes at the title and walk away. I wouldn't have been interested- I mean, we get enough of this stuff with day-to-day life around here- but someone recommended it to my husband, who recommended it to me. It was actually a refreshing take on college admissions. The author's point is that straight-A, athletically successful, volunteering, high SAT-scoring, student body presidents- or that type of student- are now a dime a dozen- and rather boring to college admissions officers. However, students who eschew keeping up such a grind, but rather find their own interests and excel at them, will stand out to college admissions committees. The author explains how students can free up time by dropping activities that don't mean much to them or to admissions officers, and gain time for pursuits that are interesting to them and also to colleges. My one fault with the book is that it still is focused on how to get into traditional top-notch schools, and doesn't acknowledge that getting into those schools is not every student's goal. I guess the assumption is that if you can get into top tier schools, you can get in anywhere.\n",

      "“Getting into a good college doesn’t have to be a reward for extreme sacrifice; it can be, instead, a side effect of the much grander goal of building a meaningful and engaging life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How to be a High School Superstar\" by Cal Newport proposes an unorthodox method to securing a spot in your dream college. According to popular belief, to stand out in college applications, one must immerse themselves in a wide range of extracurricular activities and an abundance of difficult courses. Contrary to this, the book showcases a different, more laid-back approach in achieving the same goal: the relaxed superstar approach. This lesser-known method features lots of free time, less stress, and higher odds of getting accepted into your dream school. It proposes the ideology that doing is the foundation for becoming impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book provides specific steps and methods on how exactly this can be achieved. With the help of thorough research and plenty of interviews, the message aimed to be delivered by Newport comes across quite smoothly. The instructions and steps given are easy-to-follow and are written clearly. What I also really liked about the book was that it gave study methods that are much more efficient and less taxing than the usual techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "As seen in the quote I derived from the book itself, its teachings are not only applicable in a high school student's life. These strategies can also help one yield benefits richer than getting into their dream school.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this in mind, I definitely look forward to applying these concepts, theories, and techniques presented in the book to my life. I believe that taking these to heart and internalizing them will truly yield exceptional results. I believe that the techniques given in this book are not only applicable to high school students; this may also be an insightful read to those applying for jobs or are in college.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, I highly recommend this book for high school students, especially those who are currently or planning to drown themselves in difficult courses and an overabundance of extracurricular activities in order to higher their odds of a better future. You might learn a thing or two from this book.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "This was an awesome book! I think it's encouraging to high school students and it is engaging enough for a high school student such as myself to read without losing interest. Below are the main points of the novel, summarized to the best of my abilities:\n",
      "\n",
      "Part 1: The Law of Underscheduling\n",
      "- Relaxed superstars basically do less, but seem to do more.\n",
      "- Instead of pursuing many activities that you are not actually interested in (resumé padding; breadth without depth; call it what you will), and taking the most challenging and impressive-sounding courses, free up your schedule.\n",
      "- This means that you might have to *gasp* quit classes and activities that don't really matter to you.\n",
      "- Make time to explore your interests and develop a genuine, deep interest ( passion!) - become an interesting person.\n",
      "- Try to achieve an ideal student workday and set a specific time every day to stop working. By separating your work time and your free time, you'll be more focused and effective when you work, and you'll get more out of the time you spend exploring your interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "- The Superstar Effect: Little differences in ability lead to huge differences in benefit. The best way I can explain this is the Olympics. Even if you are beaten by a millisecond, a silver in the Olympics reaps way fewer benefits than gold.\n",
      "- In other words, being good is usually not enough to create impressiveness. You have to be the best.\n",
      "- Also, it doesn't matter how difficult the activity actually is, as long as you are the best at it in the admissions pool.\n",
      "- The Superstar Effect only takes effect if there is 'proof' that you are an expert/master/the best at the activity, such as press coverage or glowing recommendations.\n",
      "- Once you accomplish something, you can achieve complementary accomplishments with little additional effort. If you have a solid foundation in leadership, as one of the book's examples did, you'll continue to achieve things related to leadership with little effort on your part.\n",
      "- If you have identified one thing to focus on, you need to become good at it. You can do this by learning how to be good at it (reach out to experts but also study failures), completely immersing yourself in the activity, and reaching the point where you are skilled enough that good opportunities will come your way (opportunities that won't require an excessive time commitment).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "- People are impressed by things that they cannot imagine themselves doing - so the goal is not to do something difficult, but to do something that is hard to explain.\n",
      "- Innovators don't try to be innovative. They don't have a Eureka! moment where they suddenly dedicate their high school careers to one grand project.\n",
      "- Innovators join closed communities (communities that people recognize, but do not understand the inner workings of) and pay their dues. In other words, they become positively recognized within the community first.\n",
      "- Innovators don't start out with the biggest idea. They start with small, doable projects and work their way up to an 'impressive' project.\n",
      "- Basically, people who succeed take the opportunities they get and work hard, which leads to more opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hopefully the summary is informative to those of you who are unsure if the book would be helpful. I have definitely left out some good points made in the book, so if these main points pique your interest, I would recommend checking out!\n",

      "Cade “Alamo” Burnett is a defender for the Chicago Rebels, a professional hockey team. The Rebels had been in a slump for years but this year, with their three new owners, they are slowly rising in the ranks. Cade was raised in Texas by a father who believed that Texas was football, beer and pretty southern girls. Only that’s not Cade at all. Cade is gay. He’s known he was all his life. But he keeps it a secret. Only one person knows the truth and that’s his best friend, Violet. He can’t bear to inflict the truth on his Dad knowing the pain it will cause him. And of course there’s the hockey culture. How would they react? So, he keeps his true self a secret. Then one day the new general manager walked in and Cade couldn’t breathe. Standing in front of the team was the object of every one of Cade’s teenage fantasies, Dante Moretti.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Dante has gone from being a player to now a member of management. It’s his dream come true so he can’t let anything ruin that. That includes letting anyone know that he is crushing on one of the players, the players that he is in charge of. And when he finds out that the same player is also gay, it doesn’t take long for these two to find their way to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, I loved Dante and Cade. And let me tell you, this book is ice cubes on your neck hot! But it’s also about finding the strength to let the world know who you really are. It’s about the team members you surround yourself with every day who have your back. It’s about accepting someone, no matter what. I love this team. I read the first book in this series but somehow missed book two. I definitely need to go back and read that one. I am just in love, though, with this little book. And book three will be out soon, Hooked On You, which is Violet’s story. This is a fantastic series. I hope you’ll give it a try!\n",

Now we get all the deets - UNDONE BY YOU runs parallel to .\n",

      "I've always had a thing for the sharp, a little sardonic and reserved Dante Morretti, the first out and proud gay GM of a hockey team. When he runs into happy-go-lucky D-man of his team, Cade \"Alamo\" Burnett, at an exclusive gay club he can't believe his eyes. While Dante is still calculating the PR nightmare of an NHL player being outed as gay, Cade starts a game of seduction and Dante stands no chance in hell to resist him. As his boss, though, Dante can't, won't let his attraction get out of control.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved Cade from the first moment I met him. He is a light-hearted, laid-back Texan guy, always a joke on his lips to lighten the mood and cheer up the team. Of course, it isn't until UNDONE BY YOU that you realize that he, too, comes with baggage. He is firmly in the closet for multiple reasons and none of them have to do with cowardice. One, there is his dad, who is proud of him but being from Texas he has a rather old-fashioned opinion about what a family must look like. Two, there is still the misconception that only because you're gay you can't be masculine and thus don't belong on a testosterone-fueled hockey team that also has all sorts of homophobic characters. It's like fighting wind mills. But Cade isn't just adorable, endearing, funny and playful, he is also bold and brave and it's the combination that has Dante's hormones raging. I adore him and his connection with Violet. Their friendship is so incredibly special.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dante doesn't want to think of Cade as a potential relationship. Too many obstacles stand in their way. For one there is the fact that he is Cade's boss. Then there is the age gap. And third he promised himself never to bind himself to somebody who was still closeted. He'd given up too much to let himself be second best in somebody else's life. In his experience coming out comes with sacrifices, however, the freedom of it beats the hiding and secrecy by a long shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dante was everything I expected him to be and more. He was protective of Cade, always had an open ear for him and ready with advice if asked. He also made me a little angry but there was also understanding for where he was coming from. Dante turned out to be the enigma I thought him to be. He was a contradiction of reserved, cool, collected and warm, kind, wise and vulnerable. - yes, it sounds weird and I applaud Kate Meader to transfer that through her words.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quote below is significant - and it shows what's wrong with society. It's taken from the conversation Dante has with Cade's father.\n",

      "Figures that this novella is my favorite in the series so far. I wish Ms. Meader would have written a full length novel about Cade and Dante, the material would have been there. But, we still have one more story coming up in this series and I can't wait to see more of these two. UNDONE BY YOU is a wonderful addition to the Chicago Rebels series and has it all - it's sexy and sweet, two wonderful leads and full of banter. I have no idea how Kate Meader comes up with this stuff but her brand of humor totally aligns with mine.\n",

      "Dante is the GM of the Chicago Rebels hockey team. He's also ridiculously good looking, mostly grumpy and openly gay. When he runs into one of his star defenseman in a gay club, he's stunned. When the man he thought to be straight as an arrow and having a fling with one of the Chase sisters clearly propositions him, he's equally shocked and tempted. Cade is super sexy, easy going, funny, and super off limits. But as determined as Dante is to resist Cade, Cade is just as determined to seduce him. Thus begins the most delicious game of cat and mouse and back and forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dante is hesitant to get involved with a closeted hockey player. He's had his heart broken in the past and he's not looking to put it all on the line again. He's put in blood, sweet and tears into his career, as well. It takes a lot for an openly gay man in the league to get the respect he deserves and Dante earned it the hard way. How can he put all of that at risk for a man that threatens everything, including his sanity. A relationship with a player is frowned upon. The fact that no one knows Cade is gay doesn't help matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cade was absolute perfection. He knows what he wants and he goes after it with a singleminded intent. He doesn't shy away from a challenge and he's not afraid to push all of Dante's buttons. I loved his easy going nature. I especially loved the way these two alpha males balanced each other out with their completely different personalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Full of witty banter, incredible chemistry, and endearing characters, Undone By You totally owned my heart. I loved the connection between Dante and Cade. I loved the slow burn of their developing relationship. I especially loved the way that Cade handled his coming out and Dante and the rest of the team supported him. I loved all the interactions with the secondary characters. I just seriously loved this book and this story.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cade’s natural affability and light hearted personality has served him well in the past. His relationship with his father bounced back when Cade chose hockey over football, despite the fact his father continues to be a venerable college football coach. While choosing hockey over football was a big obstacle to overcome, admitting to his father he prefers men over women could be a deal breaker, and that’s a risk Cade isn’t ready to take. Still, That doesn’t stop him from lusting after his hot as hell boss.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a former player and present GM for a professional hockey team, Dante Moretti has made hockey the most important part of his life. He knew coming out would make his dream of becoming a general manager that much more difficult, but the Chase sisters and the Chicago Rebels have finally made that dream a reality. His attraction to Cade Burnett, his best defenseman, is a distraction he doesn’t need. Still, when an encounter between the two at an exclusive club leads to the promise of some seriously hot naked time, Dante can’t say no.\n",

      "\n",
      "As much as I enjoyed the hot as shit lust between Cade and Dante, their underlying vulnerabilities are what made this story for me. At twenty three and still firmly in the closet, Cade managed to be both strong and floundering at the same time and he owned all of it. No over the top, compensating for anything, professional athlete here. He accepted himself but still wasn’t sure how to introduce that part of himself to the ones he cared about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dante. Always in control of things, Dante. I loved how the man who thought he had it all figured out could still be brought to is knees, both literally and figuratively, by the sweetness that is Cade.\n",

      "I’ve enjoyed the previous two books in this series but this one holds a special place in my heart. Dante and Cade were everything I’d hoped they’d be and that’s saying something considering I’ve been looking forward to this one for awhile.\n",

      "Nate Braden has been in love with his best friend, Rick’s, sister for years. But he never made his move because at first she was too young and then he was enlisted in the military so he didn’t want to tell her how he felt before he returned, too afraid he wouldn’t return from war. But his dream of finally telling Jewel the truth died the day Rick was killed during a routine mission he had ordered. But Nate had promised Rick that he would take care of his family and that is what Nate intends to die now that he’s finally returned from war. But telling Jewel about his feelings is not an option anymore, the guilt he lives with won’t allow it.\n",

      "\n",
      "While this had a higher angst, it did not consume the story. Both Nate and Jewel had issues to deal with that related to her brother’s death so I was expecting it to be pretty heavy. It was actually pretty well balanced with the relationship drama, family issues and working through Rick’s death.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm being too hard on this book, but Jewel was unbearable & Nate's only flaw was misplaced guilt, so he was kind of boring. But final straw for me was that the conflict could have been solved on page 2 if everyone involved had acted liked adults & HAD AN HONEST CONVERSATION.\n",

      "It’s short, lovely and romantic and sweet and quiet…\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, the characters were beautifully flawed. Sometimes, when people want to do something positive and have this really big fear for something, they tend to go extremes which will show the opposite result – the negative counterpart of what one intended to. Jewel was selfless (which is admirable) but extremely overprotective. I love how her character grew towards the end. Nate, on the other hand, is really caring, in general and is the perfect match for her. Okay, there was one part he should’ve came clean earlier but really, a person who pushes you to be the best you can be is all you can ever need in life. He is a great friend and heavily-burdened because of that. In the end, he changed for the better, and I love that the most about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the family aspect of this book which was well-executed and the romance was great too. I had to soak up every word to really get the feelings but it was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the plot went on a good pace. Nothing in particular felt rushed, hurried, or too slow. Also, this is well-written. Although short, this book managed to tell a wonderful growth between everything, mainly Jewel. She evolved from who she was in a lot of aspects – family-wise, self-wise, and romantically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Healed by Love, in overall, is a wonderful read. I would emphasize on the character growth and family aspect. Really, you cannot decide for one person or three. Remember that no matter what you think, people change, people grow, and there would be a time that you need to back up a little. Love stays if it’s true and if anything is meant to be, it’ll happen. Things happen for a reason, whether we like it or not. Also, people leave to make space for others. Life is too big to stay with the same circle. One just has to let go of the loss and remember that there are a lot of ways you can still keep this person with you. Also, don’t be scared to change. Life changes which means you also have to. This is a beautiful read about love – love for family, friends, and romance. It’s really short so I suggest you go pick this up and read it on your free time. Especially if you’re a sucker for romance with a little history.\n",

      "Just discovered this author and I am completely captivated by her imagination and in this case her manner of opening up the conversation pertaining to two important topics being discussed and acted upon. Although serious and disturbing, the author cleverly and humorously introduces gossip, as secondary conversation as well as a serious last scene that is funny, chaotic and shocking. Well done Liane Moriarty. Looking forward to more.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I only discovered Liane Moriarty earlier this year when I first read 'What Alice Forgot' - and loved it! Since then I have gradually worked my way through her writings so far and 'Big Little Lies' DID NOT disappoint! What an easy top rating of five stars this was to give!\n",
      "\n",
      "Liane tackles some meaty subjects; domestic violence, bullying, lies, alcohol and even murder - and uses the everyday world of the school playground's cliquey parents at the centre of her plot. Her use of the playground cliques creates some very interesting parallels between the world of children and that of the adults, their parents, leading to some reflective questioning. As we grow up do we ever really move away from the issues that dominate the childhood world, or do they just mature into something bigger? Is ALL our children's behaviour learned from their parents (the age old debate on the influences of nature or nurture)?\n",
      "\n",
      "'Big Little Lies' is an addictive read, the author cleverly adding to the tension with section headings gradually leading to the main event, the Trivia Night. For example, 'Six months before the trivia night,' Five months before the trivia night,' until finally, 'The trivia night' near the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author's observations of human nature and her understanding of peoples' strengths and weaknesses are real, sensitive, empathetic and unfailingly sharp, and her writing is full of affection for the characters she has created. Little tableau 'interviews' provide snapshots of different perspectives which adds a nice little touch of intimacy between reader and story.\n",

I stayed up late reading it and then went to bed and couldnt sleep as I mulled over the plot twists and possible outcomes, it just ticked all the boxes...original, full of aha and ohh moments, compelling, beautiful writing style and a darn good tale.\n",

      "The plot revolves around 3 mums thrown together who forge a friendship of sorts against the odds.\n",

      "There were some very heavy social issues tackled along the way such as domestic violence, bullying and the dangers of the internet. All were handled in a realistic manner.\n",

      "As soon as I received my copy, I started going through my home room by room. But then it became so interesting, that I sat down to really take a closer look and read it, to truly understand all of the aspects of what she is teaching. I got so excited redoing the first room, prosperity, and abundance, of course, first! An unexpected check arrived in the mail that very day. I am well aware that the check would have been there if I had not made changes, but I thought it was a fascinating and super fun coincidence.\n",

      "I then started on other areas of the house by making quick fixes for each room as I read along the book. I am having so much fun as I read, getting up to make a change with what’s already in my home that I am looking forward to making more detailed changes next. Plus using the Feng Shui cures from Taoism and shamanic techniques from around the world as well. I will treasure this book for years to come. I know it will be my go-to whenever I need to freshen up different areas of my life.\n",

      "Daredevil by Frank Miller & Klaus Janson volume 1 contains Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #27-#28, and Daredevil #158-#161 and #163-#172.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a lot of his life before this volume, Daredevil was strictly a b-lister, a poor man's Spider-Man. In this volume, even before Frank Miller takes the writing reins as well as the art, begins the shift toward something more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite a bit of what would later wind up on the Netflix show is introduced or refined here. Ben Urich deduces Daredevil's identity. Bullseye firmly establishes himself as Daredevil's arch-nemesis. Elektra is introduced. And probably the most impactful, the Kingpin and Daredevil lock horns for the first time. People forget that The Kingpin was a Spider-Man villain for a decade before he entered Daredevil's life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spider-Man tales are Frank Miller's first experience with Daredevil, helping a blind Spider-Man take on the Masked Marauder. They aren't really linked to the rest of the tales other than featuring Daredevil. The Daredevil issues feature Black Widow, Daredevil's current girlfriend Heather Glenn, Bullseye, The Gladiator, the Mauler, Doctor Octopus, Bullseye, Elektra, and the Kingpin. That glosses over a lot of stuff, like Daredevil trying to stop a rampaging Hulk and winding up in the hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Roger MacKenzie at the helm, Daredevil was battling street level villains. Once Frank Miller takes the reins, the crime element increases exponentially and Daredevil gets caught in the Kingpin's orbit. Frank Miller's art is still in its embryonic phase, not yet where he would end up on Dark Knight Returns a few years later, but still a couple notches above a lot of the artists of the time period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daredevil by Frank Miller & Klaus Janson volume 1 is the beginning of Daredevil's metamorphosis from second-rate poor man's Spider-man to what he would later become in Miller's hands. Four out of five stars.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This collection, bringing together Peter Parker, Spectacular Spiderman 27-28, and Daredevil 158-161 and 163-172 really brings back memories.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a nerdy kid back then and paid 40 or 50 cents for these issues off the rack. Over the years I’ve kept most of my collection, but traded and / or sold some over the years and if I could go back to my 12-year-old self I would say, besides slipping little Lyn a list of the Super Bowl and World Series winners for the next 40 years, “KEEP the FRANK MILLER D&D issues”!\n",
      "\n",
      "It’ll take me $$$ to get back some of the issues I once had and paid a few bucks for back then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, great to read these stories again and it’s wild to think that this run turned the DD title around and brought him up from the B-listers to the mainstream Marvel sellers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miller and Jansen collaborated to make this an incredible noir-crime story. Daredevil’s ongoing feud with Bullseye and Kingpin, with Elektra making it all the more cool, is one of the great story arcs in all of comics.\n",
      "\n",
      "And speaking of Bullseye, I still think he’s one of the premier Marvel villains, a chaotic evil operator on the scale of Joker. Like Molecule Man, the only reason he’s not more epic in scale is his serious mental illness.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Marvel, Miller and all comics fans.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Frank Miller's Daredevil is one of the main contributing factors to the creation of the Dark Age of Comics which, hyperbole aside, was an attempt to bottle the lightning created by Miller and Alan Moore across multiple series. Frank Miller, however, took a character who was always just shy of a second-rate Spiderman and turned him into a character who has had a movie as well as television series with multiple spin offs. As a comic book historian as well, it also generated a much more successful franchise by imitation with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles being originally designed as a \"homage\" with the weirdness turned way up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, the first volume of this collection is a complete and utter disaster. This isn't because of Frank Miller but because of the fact, clearly, someone thought they should try and get three volumes out of \"Frank Miller's Daredevil\" when there really were only two volumes of the series possible. In order to pad the length of the volume, they've included many issues where Frank Miller is the ARTIST rather than writer. No shade thrown on Marv Wolfman, Bill Mantlo, or Roger McKenzie but that's not what people came here to read. It's misleading at best and false advertising at worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, only roughly four issues at the end of the volume are actually \"Frank Miller's Daredevil\" and you can tell they're the product of an entirely different sort of mind than the other authors. Marv Wolfman may be one of my favorite authors for his Teen Titans work but his Daredevil reads like Nightwing and I can't really tell who was written like who given the dates. Frank Miller's Daredevil is a darker and edgier interpretation of the character from the get-go and all the better for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really, the first two-thirds of the book work as a kind of interesting \"before and after.\" The first comic in the volume is a team-up with a blinded Spiderman against the Maggia where a genetic costumed evil-doer is planning to take over New York City unless the duo manage to defeat him. There's also a fight against a mentally ill man called the Gladiator\n",
      "and some surprisingly decent Bullseye stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is, notably, the time period where Matt Murdock is dating the Black Widow and there's a somewhat mystifying decision where Daredevil dumps her for an uninteresting socialite named Heather. Then again, it would be decades before people finally gave Natasha Romanova the respect she deserved. Nowadays, it just looks like Matt really is blind, deaf, and dumb for ending that relationship. Still, the worst issues are at the start of the book and feel like Spiderman comics with none of the Parker angst to get you through the punching garishly dressed villains. Matt doesn't have Peter's humor either.\n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned, the last quarter of the comic is where Frank Miller's Daredevil begins and has some classic issues of the kind we actually want to see. These include the introduction of Elektra Natchios, which still holds up today, and the return of the Kingpin after his \"retirement\" in the pages of Spiderman. Matt is shown as a flawed hero in these volumes as he's too free with his powers in public as a legal student plus prioritizes getting the Kingpin's files over saving his wife. Matt is unsympathetic and an absolute moralist, which makes him a character who can screw up royally.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I don't feel like I can recommend this volume for these four issues despite the fact they're really good and important to the understanding of Daredevil. The other issues, particularly the Bullseye ones, aren't bad, though. Actually, a couple of them are but that's because it's clear they didn't have any idea where they were going with Matt. Hopefully, the real Frank Miller's Daredevil will be on display in volume 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "5/10\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I think that Daredevil is the first impaired superhero. There were other characters who had vision problems but they were restored in one way or another. Daredevil is the first superhero that while blind continues to be active, able and effective. He rises above his imperilment and learns to live with it and compensate. Actually, not just compensate but turn it into an advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the exception of Batman, Daredevil is one of the loneliest superheroes. It isn’t just that he hides his identity from all his friends. It’s his nature. He is quiet and distant, borderline antisocial; he feels more comfortable observing rather than participating. He is also very collected and the least humorous superhero. The least talkative too. Whenever he engages in battle he is always calm, focused, ruthless, imaginative, clever, and almost never engages into pointless bragging.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is also one of the 'darkest', grimmest superheroes, sometimes he looks positively tortured. Sometimes he sets off in a self-destructive path. He is so single-minded in his pursue and so proud that he will not retreat not even when that would be the logical choice, not even when he risks losing far more important thing in life. He has a harsh nature and ends up pushing everyone away, even though he hates his loneliness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daredevil is street-smart, he is comfortable in shady places and he uses the appropriate language. Yet, at the same time he is educated, accomplished and respected as a lawyer. He is one of the most well dressed, poised end eloquent superheroes. Sometimes he comes across a bit snobbish and sometimes he is just charming.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoyed the parts where we got to see a bit more that Daredevil kicking villains' ass. I enjoyed his comradery with spider-man and \"Exposé\" was my favorite story!\n",
      "\n",
      "What really bothered me was the lack of decent female characters. Whenever a female entered the scene she was either a vapid, flimsy socialite or an extremely sensuous figure whose only purpose was to please the hero or follow him around. I was annoyed. Also if women have to walk around in those gigantic breast, why aren't their male counterparts equally unrealistically portrait?\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "If you know anything about Daredevil, you know that he really came into his own as a character when Frank Miller took over writing the series.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've read every issue of Daredevil leading up to this volume, and everything that makes him work as a character was already in place before Miller started penciling the series. There were good issues and bad issues before Miller got involved, but the formula was getting stale. Basically, there would always be a soap-opera subplot going on with blind lawyer Matt Murdock (Daredevil's alter ego), or with one of his romantic partners, or with his best friend and law partner Franklin \"Foggy\" Nelson. This subplot would string along for several issues, but each individual issue would be dominated by a colorful super-villain. Daredevil would do battle with this villain and crack wise like Spider-Man. That was about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first half of this volume only showcases Miller's work as an artist. Roger McKenzie was still writing the series. Miller's first issue as both artist and writer is #168, and with that issue he ret-conned Elektra (the deadly Greek female assassin who is out to avenge her father's death) into Matt Murdock's life. Over the course of the next several issues, Miller created a dense criminal underworld with the Kingpin at its head and the vicious, psychopathic Bullseye as his most dangerous lieutenant. These issues are a joy to read. Plots and subplots are woven together seamlessly, and they have a great sense of griminess and nastiness, which suits the early 1980s NYC setting perfectly.\n",

      "All the youthful feelings of adoration and longing were conveyed so well.\n",
      "The hope that Evie continues to secretly hold on to that Gray will truly see her and choose her continues into adulthood.\n",
      "As adults they both are back in their hometown and there’s a shift between the two that turns into an affair with a time-limit.\n",
      "I felt for Evie, it’s such an easy thing to understand even as I was cursing her naïveté for believing she could handle just sex with the only person she’s had strong feelings for.\n",
      "Gray is closed off and behaves in a way that had me as enthralled and frustrated as poor Evie. He gives her and the reader emotional whiplash. He’s hot and cold. He lets her in a little just to slam the proverbial door on her.\n",
      "I loved the way it kept me off balance, wondering how he really feels. I was on the emotional ride with Evie. I HAD to know how this would play out.\n",
      "There’s passion and incredible chemistry between the two. There are moments of emotional connection that I loved.\n",
      "I loved the little moments when Gray made me feel butterflies. I loved the peeks into his feelings, I began to really adore him and get an idea of why he behaved the way he did and what was holding him back.\n",

      "- Evie as a character had more good moments but still was infuriating a lot of the time.\n",
      "- there were some cute moments…\n",
      "\n",
      "Things I think could use some work/things I personally did not enjoy:\n",
      "- Gray as a character was very flat to me. Having this be a dual POV could have made it better. We are constantly in Evie’s head and she’s guessing a lot about him\n",
      "- Evie constantly guessing and not speaking as to what is on her mind was frustrating\n",
      "- Their “we have problems, we fight about the problems, then we fuck the problems away, and then the problems are actually not gone” form of communication was annoying. Their miscommunication, well lack of communication really.\n",
      "- They didn’t seem to have any chemistry outside of physical/sexual. BECAUSE THEY DONT TALK. A lot of Gray’s character depended on the fact that he’s known her for 20 years, because they barely talked when they were in person. Because of this its a hard stretch to believe he’s also been pining for her for 20 years.\n",
      "- This is not a friends with benefits situation, Evie and Gray are not friends, this is more casual acquaintances who casually fuck have zero contact outside of that.\n",
      "- I am not enjoying the use of “intact” to mean virginity. (Ex. “Does it bother you that I’m…intact?”) 🥴\n",
      "- Let alone the lowkey fetishization of the FMC being a virgin “It’s hot, knowing no other guy has been inside you.” And this was AFTER the LI freaked the fuck out and insulted her for being a virgin. And the later did a half assed apology. 🙄\n",
      "- I’m sorry the use of “foreign warmth” for his cum inside her 🤢\n",
      "- The spice…\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, you’re probably asking yourself, “if you didn’t like it why didn’t you dnf?” And I will answer that for you it was short and while I did not enjoy it per-say, I was entertained. Overall not a good or bad time, 2.5 stars rounding down for goodreads. I would read something else by this author.\n",

      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is my all-time favorite Anita Stansfield novel - and the one before it, The Gable Faces East, is a close second. They are intense stories with intricate characters. Michael Hamilton makes such a likable villain! I love the historical setting. An added bonus is that you get the complete stories that are only hinted at in the original modern-time Michael and Emily trilogy.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Ooh, I absolutely love this book. I read it a long time ago, but have read it 3 times since. It is captivating and wonderful as are all of Anita's earlier books. I really enjoy how a lot of them interconnect. I found it amusing, after reading others comments, how they too would like to be kidnapped by an Australian rogue and fall in love with him. That would be nice. *Sigh*\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is everything I hoped it would be and more. I thoroughly love a good romance novel and a period drama is even better. You know how those historical romance novels are usually pretty cheesy? Well, this one isn't! I'm not sure I would even put it in the same class as a regular historical romance. This is way out of their league! It is totally believable and you fall for the characters immediately. The setting is very desirable. Australian outback, gorgeous rich family, horse racing, and even a home for wayward boys!\n",
      "\n",
      "Emma is my favorite character. She is so strong and smart. Very down to earth. I wasn't so fond of Lacey though. I knew she was going through a lot, but after all she had been given she shouldn't have been acting like that. She really needed to get over it sooner than she did. I fell in love with Michael and Tyson. I wanted more Tyson actually.\n",

      "The plot just kept moving. There was always something new happening and I just fell in love with the surroundings. Author Anita Stansfield writes as if you ARE part of the family. I know them so well. I know where my room is, and where my horse stays, and what we'll be having for dinner. I felt a part of their life. She is a master writer!\n",

Subsequent books tell stories about them and their children and their children's lives. This 2-book set talks about Michael's ancestors. I have read these several times. :)\n",

      "BRIEF SUMMARY\n",
      "This is the third installment of the author’s series called Louisiana Liaisons; it’s about three divorced friends who decided to meet for a night together but all got detoured. Book1: Seduced by the American Millionaire , book2: Blackmailed Into Bed and book3: Bedded by the Boss. In Bedded by the Boss, Robert newly employs Renee. She leaves her job of 10 years to work for Robert because the pay is better to help with her daughter’s college fund. Robert owns a construction company and is very attracted to Renee. He finds that he is unable to work with her and needs to find away to selfishly make her leave his employ. The book contains explicit sex and language.\n",
      "\n",
      "THOUGHTS\n",
      "If you enjoyed Blackmailed into Bed, then you will really like Bedded by the Boss, it does not disappoint. I felt like I was reading a Harlequin Presents book gone wild in a good way. This read was definitely more aggressive with Robert’s strong Alpha male character, and I still loved it. Robert was very sexy, demanding, and possessive; throughout the book Robert makes jealously looks so sexy. Renee surely held her own throughout the book even though Robert made her nervous at times. It was also nice to hear Renee talk and reconnect with Jenny. This read was definitely a tension builder leading up to Robert and Renee’s intimacy. I also enjoyed their tennis match conversation on quitting and firing especially in one particular scene of the book. I personally enjoyed all 3 books and I am glad I read them. I also think James Cameron; the charmer should get his own story, which would definitely be another good read. James was a client of Robert that was also interested in Renee and drove Robert mad with jealously.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really have no dislikes of the book, I only wish that both Renee and Robert said I love you to each other a little earlier on in the read, but that’s fine I can live with that.\n",

      "**re-read** In the third installment of Louisiana Liaison Renee has worked for Robert and is upset at his advances its not because he isn't gorgeous because he is its because she will never get involved with a married man. Robert wants Renee and he wants her to quit so he can finally have her, he never has to try as hard as he has with Renee. Then one day while working Renee finds out that Robert isn't married and Robert is making life harder working for him. After days of the worst working environment Renee decides theres no point in denying that she wants Robert so they agree to sleep with one another with no relationship. But once isn't enough and soon each finds themselves wanting more but is sure the other doesn't feel the same. What can I say I loved Robert, Loved Renee and loved the side characters Robert was crazy jealous and possessive. This is another lynda Chance hit!\n",

I have read a few true crime books and have learned about some demented people.... but \"demented\" doesn't even describe these people. Despite the fact that this is a difficult story to stomach, it is a very gripping one. How the things that happened carried on for so long. How the other members of the family didn't get involved. How the women under this mans control didn't realize this guy was a wacko. None of it makes any sense. You will be blown away. It's almost to strange to believe. Your typical \"disfunctional family\" will seem like the Waltons compared to this group. Utterly indescribable. When you read the book... you will understand.\n",

      "This was like a pleasant stroll through the woods on a warm day. But I've discovered is that I need someone to trip over a few logs along the way to perk my spirits. I actually expected this to have some conflict because of what Sivan has been through, I also expected Jax to arrogant and for them to have a love/hate dynamic going on. What I actually got was a pretty straightforward plain romance. I wanted a bit of angst to keep things going and I wanted to see Sivan open up about her past.\n",

      "So I am actually going to give this one 4.5 stars. As you look through my library you can definitely tell this isn’t my typical listen. I can safely say that I loved every minute of it and it was quite unexpected. This book had a lot of heart and is going to make one helluva romantic comedy movie one day. We have a female and male lead character who do a great job coming of age and you just route for time and time again. They are both full of sass and spunk but at times are vulnerable. I loved the dual point of you and it switches back-and-forth between chapters it really gave us an in-depth look from both characters perspectives. Typically, with dual point of you I like there to be 2 different narrators but not in this case as I will explain a little later. Whether or not the author meant some seems to be absolutely hilarious or not… They definitely were I was laughing out loud many time throughout the entire book. Equal parts funny, serious and heartwarming this one has something for everyone. Now, let me get into the performance of the narrator, she was brilliant! If I could some up her performance she is a one woman show, hands-down and bravo! She did a young girls voice, and out rage female teenager, four or five different teenage males and adult voices to boot. The transition from male to female voices was very well done and I enjoyed every second of it. This was my first Book by this narrator but I will be definitely looking out for more of her work. There was even two times I counted that with the help of the production crew she made the male and female lead characters speak at the same time. It was fantastic. Now I can only speculate, but I’m pretty sure when the female lead character was crying so was the narrator that’s how good she was. Great job and you really brought the words to life this was a great overall experience for me.** A big shout out to the Audioshelf crew for providing me a copy of this book for winning a contest. This in no way affected my opinion of this book.**\n",

He's the one Jayne brother who didn't want to join the family boy band, but much to his distress, his refusal to join the band has given him a mysterious persona and a huge fan base of his own. He has a huge following of crazed fans and enthusiastic fans who have taken over his life and forced him to hide away to finish school.\n",

I really didn't see a certain event coming (sorry it's a HUGE spoiler so can't say much) and was at a complete loss what to think. I didn't personally feel this was needed for a story where the characters have already been through so much. It left several answered questions and undeveloped plot points but I appreciated how this event propelled characters into making decisions and facing past issues head on. It just left me feeling unsettled and kinda annoyed.\n",

It may be the plight of sea creatures in one book, the next book may take joblessness into consideration, and then some will take conservation of land and weave it into the plot. Never preachy is our Ms. Chapman, but you always come away from one of her books thinking about deeper issues as well as happy from her happily- ever -after's!\n",

      "(Nov) I wanted to like this book - I think I've read pretty much every book JC has written (and I think I like her non magic books better - but she left them behind a while ago I guess). But this really fell flat for me. Duncan was a great hero - gruff, hot, sexy, etc. Peg on the other hand - blah. She was a bit fanatical about \"protecting\" her \"babies\" - and it came off as obnoxious. She was also a bit too proud \"I am woman hear me roar.\" Her 8 year old spoke like a 12 year old. She is on food stamps and cuts coupons but her mom and aunt (both widows) live near by - why can't they help her w/child care - or just live w/her and help out financially? She met her husband in high school - but he died at 30, 3 years ago. She is now 28 (the way she spoke and acted, thought she was in her mid 30s at least), so she was 25 when he died - which makes him 5 years older than her - what kind of high school is that?! Biggest complaint? Every character - but mostly Peg - \"growls\" every spoken word (while growling can be sexy, personally I've never heard anyone speak in a way that I think \"wow, they are growling\"). Seriously, I'll pay someone $1 to go through this book and tell me how many times the word growl(ed) appears? Second to growl is scowl. Sounds like a bunch of angry dogs! Can't believe an editor didn't correct this, as it drove me crazy!\n",

      "\n",
      "A mysterious, newly introduced hero. A young, fiercely protective; widowed mother of four. The combined magic of Pine Creek, Midnight Bay, and Spellbound Falls Maine. The return of several beloved previous characters...all together in one novel--makes Charmed by his Love, one of the best this author has written.\n",
      "\n",
      "Janet Chapman's pen (or keyboard) must be on fire. The latest three release's can only be described as superb, and based upon the excerpt I read on the upcoming September installment; Courting Carolina....this streak is likely to continue. I have been a fan of this author for many many years, and although I love the early work--Michael MacBain (hero of book 3) being my long standing favorite male of this series--it seems Chapman only gets better with time. If I could talk to my beloved \"father\" Dar at this very moment...I would emphatically assure him that he most certainly did not make a mistake all those years ago, when he sent Greylen MacKeage forward in time...along with a few stowaways. ;-)\n",
      "\n",
      "There is not any ONE reason Ms. Chapman's work speaks so profoundly to me, but a mixture of many. This author walks that precarious line between fantasy, and contemporary literature with a beautiful, formulatic blend that is sure to please all types of readers. I do not typically tend to enjoy children characters mixed within my romances, yet this author is unrivaled in her ability to create vibrant, realistic, wonderful children--which tend to grow up into vibrant, realistic, wonderful hero's and heroine's; of their own journey--later in the storyarc.\n",
      "\n",
      "What enamores me so much to this world Janet Chapman has created amongst our own, would actually be quite surprising to any who know me. This fantasy lover...immensely enjoys the REALNESS of these books. The relationships, and yes, the intimate scenes contained within these novels themselves. It is no secret how unrealistic the steamy sex scenes in romances can be, when compared to our own intimate experiences, however, this is not the case with this author. The experience is 100% relatable, and authentic. Here is a novelist who is unafraid to breathe real life into her sex scenes, as well as showcasing flawed characters, who must earn the love of their destined mate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps I am failing in my attempt to convey what I mean...so please do not misunderstand me. Take the serious trials, and tribulations of any couple you could find in reality...sprinkle in an ancient bloodline of Alpha Highlander warriors; forced to blend in with modern society--as well as a few other \"special\" males...and I promise there is no lack of the urge to fan yourself occasionally.

      "Not only does this latest installment hold the heartpounding action, laughing out loud humor, and fast pace plotline fans expect of a Janet Chapman novel....but Duncan MacKeage is literally the fictional equivolent of my very own living, breathing husband. His never give up, never say die work ethic. The old world chivalry, amd mannerisms, the gruff exterior hiding the heart of pure gold--is so simliar to what I experience in my own marriage everyday...it is SCARY.\n",

      "I could not have enjoyed this book more, and have but one complaint. 299 pages to tell a story of this caliber, was not nearly long enough. Bravo Ms. Chapman, and I anxiously look forward to the next installment of the Spell Bound falls trilogy, and pray that it will not be the last novel located within this majestic locale.\n",

      "Fantastic book. Peg is barely making ends meet while trying to support her 4 kids. Mac sends Duncan to Peg to buy gravel from her for the road he is building to the site of the new resort. After a less than stellar first meeting, Peg and Duncan come to an agreement. Duncan doesn't understand why he is attracted to Peg, but he is. Peg is attracted to him also, but refuses to do anything about it. She feels that getting involved with him would cause his death because of a curse the women in her family are under. Duncan is asked to keep an eye on Peg and her family while Mac and Olivia are away, and that is when things really start to happen. Things start happening on her property that put her and the children in danger. Duncan also finds out that whether he wants it or not, his family's magical legacy has come to him and he must embrace it to save Peg. I loved both Peg and Duncan. Peg is determined to stand on her own and doesn't want to risk depending on a man. But she finds it very easy to depend on Duncan, who doesn't take no for an answer. Duncan is a typical man of his family. He is very protective of women and children, and has no trouble simply taking action. I loved watching him try to deal with Peg, who he called \"contrary\", since she usually did the opposite of what he felt she should do. I also loved the way he interacted with Peg's children, and loved the children themselves. Thanks to his large family, he is experienced with kids and it's obvious he quickly comes to care for them. I loved the section when Duncan took Peg up the mountain with him to claim his magic. Just like with Olivia, I thought Peg took the idea pretty well. I really loved the last part, when Peg was kidnapped and Duncan came to her rescue. There were some really great moments there that showed her strength and the love and confidence she had in Duncan. Lots of laugh out loud moments.\n",

      "\n",
      "My Fall Back Friday choice (thanks Bethany!) was first published in 1990 but apart from no tech, it has remained as fresh as it was 29 years ago. The tech is usually what dates it There are no computers and mobile phones. Micky mourns the demise of her stereo set at the hands of some bad guys and uses pay phones when she’s on the road. No GPS either and it is sorely missed when it comes to some of the scenes in this book. It is so much easier nowadays to pinpoint someone’s location.\n",

I can see it, Mickey is that hard-nosed private eye, like Kinsey. Both authors write beautifully. I was so immersed in this book, I felt like I was right there in Louisiana.\n",
      "It's funny, at first I didn't think I was going to like Mickey. She drinks too much, sleeps around, can be crappy to her friends... but as the book continues, Mickey grows on you like a fungus, and you are powerless to do anything but believe in and root for her.\n",

      "I’ve told this story umpteen times so pardon if you’ve heard it before. I stumbled onto old detective stories when I was only 10 years old. No, not the classic Sherlock Holmes or Agatha Christie volumes or even the Dashiell Hammett noir. The books I fell into were musty paperbacks from the uk, bought for a buck fifty from the local Woolworth. I’m sure I was too young for the tawdry tales of disgraced men in rumpled suits searching for their next whiskey and the willing women that seemed to always go with it. Too young to comprehend the desperation and futility of simple lives gone wrong. What I do remember is that these stories fueled my imagination in a devilish way. Even if they weren’t the best written books.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many decades later, my GR friends kept mentioning Micky Knight and describing a character that sounded remotely familiar. A private detective who drinks herself into oblivion trying to dodge familial ghosts. A lost soul who succeeds in wrangling out of every woman’s grasp who is trying to save her. A woman with a whip-smart, complex mind who plays dangerous people like somebody juggling axes and torches. Ahh, I had found my childhood books again. Only this book is incredibly well written, fast paced, and has a female detective that’ll have you simultaneously cheering for her and wanting to also thrash her irreverent self.\n",

      "I love a dark romance and this book did not disappoint! From young lovers, to loathed enemies, this book follows the relationship of Dalton and Alexandria. This book was intense and, at times, disturbing. It contains scenes of abuse and graphic violence. So, if those are triggers for you, you may want to steer clear. It is a dark romance and not a \"rainbows and unicorns\" type of read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once optimistic and determined to take on the world together, the events of one day ten years in the past changes everything forever. Now, Dalton believes that the girl he loved betrayed him in the worst way and hatred has replaced the love he once felt for Alex. He's a cold shell of the boy he used to be and he wants to punish her for ruining his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Alex returns to her hometown after ten long years to take care of her father's affairs after his recent death, she is equally scared and excited to see the man she loves. She has never understood why he abandoned her all those years ago, turning his back on her when she needed him most. She lost the love of her life that day, as well as a brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right off the bat, this story knocked me off kilter. Alex is immediately attacked and tormented upon her return to town. The supposed love of her life just stands back and let's these terrible things happen to her. It was harsh, gritty and flat-out cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the story progressed, the reason for Dalton's animosity is revealed. Like many other books with similar themes, everything hinges on a simple misunderstanding that could have easily been resolved if the characters had just talked. That aspect was a little frustrating and redundant.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Alex and Dalton did finally clear the air, I wanted to shake Alex. I love an angsty, emotional, dark story. However, one of my pet peeves is weak heroines that forgive and forget too easily. I want to see the hero have to work for it and grovel some before they are forgiven for their crimes. In this case, it just didn't happen and believe me, Dalton had plenty to make up for. Instead, more and more suffering seemed to be piled onto Alex. How much can one woman take, realistically?\n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise, I have to say that I really enjoyed everything else about this story. Aside from the glaring grammatical error in the title, the book was surprisingly free of many editing oversights. Hopefully, they'll get that title fixed, because let's face it, that's just embarrassing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The secondary characters were fantastic also. I'm really looking forward to the story of Six, who played a significant role in this book. A sneak peek into his story is provided at the end of Ten's book and it left me wanting more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, a great story! I would have changed a few things, but nothing major. I give it 3 1/2 stars, rounded up.\n",

      "When I saw the blurb for this book- the brother’s best friend- I knew I had to read it. After thinking and thinking about this story…. contemplating what I should rate it and if I even liked it, I’ve come to one conclusion. Honestly, I think this one was a little too fucked up for me. That first 15% stared off in a bad way and turned me off the story. Yes, a lot of people will love this book, I’m in the minority of it just being okay for me. I didn’t really connect with either of the two main characters and I never felt that what happened to Alex was completely justified. Even if she did what was accused. Also, I felt she forgave much too easily. I just had trouble with some of the scenes\n",
      "\n",
      "Ker’s writing is excellent. I actually really love her style and the fact that she writes difficult to read topics. As much as I wanted to love it, sadly I didn’t. HOWEVER… I WILL be reading the next book in this series. Because SIX. The character Six was my favorite character AND favorite part of this book. So yeah, I’m totally reading Six’s book! To all those who love a dark romance and don’d mind some violence and hard to read scenes, this may just be the book for you!\n",

      "This is a hard book to rate because it's a collection of short works by different writers. The stories themselves range quite a bit in quality. Some are very good, but most of them, in my opinion, were not. While I was reading it, at first, I thought it would be between 3 and 4 stars. Then, as I went on and read more of the stories, it was a solid 3. Then 2.5. Then it got worse yet. I was very disappointed overall. One good thing about this collection is that because it's a collection of so many parts, a few bad stories won't hurt the overall experience—it's a celebration of Sherlock Holmes, and certainly the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts. Here, though, there were only two stories that I really liked, two more that were nice, and a fifth that was very good but just not my cup of tea. I'm still counting it as plus, since it was so good, and since my opinions are subjective anyway. But that still only leaves five positives out of 14 stories altogether. Again, this is all just my own reaction, but it was not a good experience. I spent most of the time feeling irritated. Then I'd get to a really good one, and I'd get my hopes up again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some stuff I didn't like:\n",
      "• Paranormal. I'm okay with it as a genre, but it doesn't fit well into Sherlock Holmes. Maybe I'd feel differently if the writers had done a better job of integrating it, or if it hadn't been used in SO MANY of the tales.\n",
      "• Non-smart Sherlock Holmes. Usually this happens alongside a perfect other character who outsmarts him at every turn. I've no problem with Sherlock being outsmarted, especially if it's by an Irene Adler figure. After all, her victory was in the VERY FIRST short story of the canon. But in that story, Sherlock was smart and clever, and Irene was cleverer still. Here, I think, some of the authors wanted their own characters to triumph, so instead of writing them smarter, they just diminished Sherlock. They made him jump to conclusions (a far cry from the “Data! Data! Data! I cannot make bricks without clay!” detective of the canon). They made him mild and prone to inaction. There were also some painful scenes of Sherlock meeting an Irene-like character, and falling over himself telling her how wonderful and smart and tough she is. Didn't feel real to me.\n",
      "• Super-perfect non-Doyle characters. Whether it’s a macho tough guy or a badass warrior woman, I would have liked something more interesting than perfect perfection\n",
      "• Gratuitous violence (I know, I know, it’s about a man who solves murders, so of course, there will be murders. It just felt a little over-the-top to me.)\n",
      "• Some of them just felt pretentious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some stuff I liked:\n",
      "• The variety. Some of these are stories set in the Doyle-era, starring Doyle characters. Others are set in modern times, still with Sherlock et al. Then there are the ones that have all original characters, but whose heroes assume the roles of Holmes and Watson. And ones where the characters are normal, everyday people who also happen to be Sherlock Holmes fans. And a whimsical Sherlock-is-really-a-bug retelling. And prose. And poetry. And a graphic novel. This is a very rich collection of many different styles and forms.\n",
      "• The humor. A few stories made me laugh out loud.\n",
      "• Whimsy\n",
      "• Fun. Some of these stories had such a nice sense of fun, and they really felt like a celebration of Doyle.\n",
      "\n",
      "My top 5:\n",
      "Dr. Watson’s Song and The Case of the Naked Butterfly, tied for first.\n",
      "The Case of the Missing Case, honorable mention. A nice origin story for Holmes. Also, they worked music into the plot, so that’s a win.\n",
      "The Adventure of the Six Sherlocks, honorable mention. A lot of fun to read about a mystery at a Sherlock Holmes convention, with a bunch of Sherlock cosplayers as suspects. The mystery element kind of falls apart if you think about it too much, but the story itself was such a hoot that I didn’t much care.\n",
      "Sherlocked. I didn’t care so much for this one, but it was well-written.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I didn’t enjoy most of this collection. Parts of it were cute, but most of these stories were either irritating or dull. I enjoy a good Sherlock yarn, but this collection just wasn’t for me.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "An anthology of stories regarding Sherlock Holmes or things adjacent to Holmes. It’s like almost all anthologies, it’s a mix of good, great, and meh. If you really like Holmes mysteries, I’m pretty sure you’ll enjoy this, maybe even love it. All others can probably safely pass on it. It’s definitely good, but there is better stuff out there for non-Holmes enthusiasts.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This was a fairly entertaining collection of Sherlock inspired tales, 14 of them in all with almost a dozen of the authors I have not read previously - a good way to sample their writing. I liked the final, short \"Hounded\" by Zoe Sharp quite a bit so I am going to try one of her books from her Charlie Fox series. Laurie King and Rhys Bowen both have stacks of \"read\" books in my virtual library, both favorites.\n",
      "There were contributions I did not care for, so three stars it is.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Hmm. While this book was a fun, fast read, I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the earlier collections in this series, A Study in Sherlock, In the Company of Sherlock Holmes, and Echoes of Sherlock Holmes. Like those first three, this is a collection of short stories somehow inspired by the Sherlock Holmes canon, by a very varied group of writers. Some stories have Holmes and Watson in them, some don't, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that a lot of the stories in this collection were less charming and quirky, and more edgy, and that's why I didn't like it as well. I don't know, it just felt... colder and darker, somehow.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A collection of stories across various genres inspired by Sherlock Holmes. Some are mysteries which stay true to the original text. Some are modern detective tales. One is about a robot. I didn't think any of the stories were particularly great.\n",

      "Welcome to Fuckland where you'll get extra special two-for-one offer! Lacey Silks doesn't waste her or your time. Her heroine Samantha looks for one night stand and she gets it after five pages. It is completely different matter who is\" lucky winner\". Last time I read f/f scene that was hot like that was when I had read Selena Kitt (who else!).\n",
      "\n",
      "Dazzled by Silver is pure erotica. There is a story behind all the steamy scenes, but it is quite obvious that main focus of the story is sex. A lot of it. Insanely hot and in all possible variations you can imagine two women and one man. Looking back, it was the best part of this novel - Lacey Silks knows how to get all hot and bothered. Background story on the other hand wasn't too convincing. General premise of the story is interesting - Sam's friend, Kendra, gets in some serious trouble with bad people and Gabe is there to help her out. Sam hooks up with Gabe, ends in the wrong place at the wrong time and he has to protect her and Kendra. Gabe has his own issues and all of this brings back some bad memories. This part of the story should have been more detailed - it's the most interesting part of the plot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dazzled by Silver had a potential to be great book. If it was mor a romantic suspense and less trashy erotica. I have noting against trashy erotica, but not everyone can pull off their inner Selena Kitt. Other than that, main male character is cliche - a bad, strong man with millions on the bank account and all kind of James Bond moves. But, that is something completely normal in this type of novels. I just wish there were a little bit more depth and story development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Story about Gabe Silver is just prequel to the, let's say, main story of the Layers Trilogy. Central character will be his cousin Tristan Cross. I really hope that novel will be better.\n",

      "There were a few key issues for me that I just could never get past. The first 4% of this book was all that I read for a good month or so before picking it back up. And what caused that???\n",
      "\n",
      "The main character was not identified as male or female. There was attraction to the hot male bartender described and then attraction to the hot female friend described... but still no description of who was the one getting turned on. Where were they? Why were they there? Nothing. Then suddenly the lead character clenched their thighs together to ease the ache.... Now I knew it was a chick, because men don't purposely squeeze their balls between their thighs...\n",
      "\n",
      "The start of this story seemed so jumbled - content on describing nothing but the shivers & aches that it failed to start the story. Then when I picked it back up and decided to stick it out and see if things would come together I found myself at 10% and I just could never get over the descriptions used.\n",

      "Samantha is newly out of a relationship with a guy that treated her like crap. She has an attraction to a good friend Kendra and also the hunky bartender Gabe. She gives into her desire to experience sex with Kendra and then decides that a no-string relationship with Gabe is just what she needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as the story progresses you find that Kendra has gotten herself into quite a pickle, Gabe and his partners are Investigators and are working the case to keep Kendra safe - find the bad guys and seek a bit of revenge for what happened during their last run in with the bad guys. But in the midst of all this they fall in love. And then it ends with a cliffhanger.\n",
      "\n",
      "After reading the other reviews, part of me feels like I read a different book. But we all have our own tastes and find different things interesting so I hope that others find something in this story they can enjoy.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The first person view of Samantha takes the reader on a sensational ride. I enjoyed this characters firsthand account of her adventurous return to dating. This author let’s the reader experience every type of emotion through Sam – simple, complex, but especially unadulterated.\n",
      "Within two weeks of meeting Gabe, I was on his plane, flying to New Zealand, half-naked and sweaty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason this didn’t get 5-mugs was the secondary character Kendra. She had the tendency to be needy and annoying. The author is going to have to do some major rejuvenation on her character for the next book.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I was given a copy for an honest review.\n",
      "Aahhh I finished it. This book just started off...off, and didn't get really any better. Even though I read the blurb before I got the book and saw the main characters names, when I started reading the book for quite a while I wasn't sure if the point of view was coming from a man or a woman named Sam. Sam was turned on by both men and women so it was confusing-until it wasn't anymore. It has lots and lots of potential it's just not what it could be. There is lots of sex and a little bit of a story line. It needs to be more in depth with the story line and have less sex. Actually the book isn't that long of a book so the amount sex could stay with the addition of more detailed story. It ends with a cliffhanger, but because the story was so not there the connection to the characters (for me) was not there either. I could care less if I find out what happens to Kendra. I'll just say, I hate to give a less than wonderful review when the author gave me the copy of the book. I'm sorry! :(\n",

      "Wow, I didn’t expect it, but I kind of hated this book. You know when you read a book that you really don’t like and it makes you frustrated and angry and sad and makes you question all your life choices. Yeah, that was me last night when I was reading this.\n",
      "\n",
      "This had all the ingredients of an amazing book. But it wasn’t the book for me..\n",
      "\n",
      "That was mostly because of 3 things.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first is that I expected this book to be funny. But characters with funny names does not a funny book make. It was like the author just decided to think up all this crazy OTT stuff and put it in this book (I especially cringed at the virgin sprite who called Twig ‘Fucko’. Yeah, so not funny). But there were no jokes, no funny one liners, nothing. It was pretty depressing actually.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second thing were Twig and Quinn. I didn’t like them. Simple as that. Quinn was sold as a sex slave when he was 19 because when he didn’t become a wizard like everyone expected, he had to pay off his debt of magic school. And what really bothered me was how casual both Quinn and Twig were about that. Quinn was loaned out to Twig and they both knew he had to go back to being a sex slave and to being abused when their time was up, and yet they never talked about getting Quinn out in the first half of this book. Especially Twig accepted all this way too easily.\n",
      "Quinn even tells Twig how he will get punished when he gets back by being loaned out to a whore house and how his master will take his voice away so he can’t scream while everyone is raping him. Quinn knows because he already endured this. You know what Twig said? Well, at least you will be free in a couple of years right, after your debt is paid? But apparently Quinn’s debt is so great he will never be free. And still Twig is not coming up with some sort of rescue plan for Quinn!!! WTH man?!? Aren’t you supposed to be the hero in this? Or at least care about what happens to Quinn? I felt as if Twig only thought about himself and how everything would affect him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then the third thing. The relationship itself. This is not a cute sweet romance. No, these guys fight, are mad at each other or trying to keep their distance for the most part of this book. Especially Twig, who is angry that Quinn has power over him (Quinn is not abusing this power and doesn’t even want it), so Twig decides to show Quinn who is the one in control here! Nothing really happens, don’t worry, but there was so much anger, it was awful. And Twig does (deliberately) hurt Quinn with the things he says. Ugh I hated them both right then. I would have hexed Twig into a twig right then and there.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is clear from the start that Twig didn’t want anything to do with the human sex slave. He didn’t even want to rescue him from a life of abuse. He also didn’t want him as a mate, no matter how strongly his dragon wanted it. Twig just wanted to live his own life and not take care of someone else. Well, Twig, you should have just gone with that then.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m sorry for the rant guys, but this book annoyed me to no end. I hate giving out low ratings, but I can't bring myself to rate it any higher. :(\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I really like as a person, and I was hoping to love like most of my friends, but it turned out not to be the story for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "How come he barely bats an eye when he finds out Quinn was kept as a sex slave and abused and raped? He's like, \"well, I guess that's what you get.\" Twig was hypocritical and annoying and I never warmed to him. And Quinn was just... meh.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plot was supposed to be more fun than it was. I didn't really get the humor, though I greatly enjoyed 's range of voices. Greg is always such a pleasure to listen to, and he carried the story for me.\n",

      "The story follows half-breed Twig Starfig, who is a one-of-a-kind part-fairy/part-dragon mix, who works as a PI specialising in retrieving missing and/or stolen magical artefacts. When a devious unicorn hires Twig to find his horn, young human Quinn Broomsparkle – who was once a wizard-in-training but is now locked in a life of servitude as the unicorn’s sex-slave – gets handed over to Twig as collateral until the horn has been located and retrieved for full payment.\n",

      "Although both are initially apprehensive of the arrangement, Twig and Quinn quickly learn that they actually work well together during their quest to find the horn. The two come to discover hidden truths about one another, regarding Quinn’s past and Twig’s mixed heritage, and as they begin to naturally develop a strong bond, Twig realises that Quinn is not only more than he first appears, but he also recognises that Quinn might actually be his destined mate.\n",
      "\n",
      "This story was quirky and audacious, delivering a fast-paced fantasy-adventure tale with a handful of silly laugh-out-loud moments, lots of action, and plenty of sweet and sexy mate moments between Twig and Quinn.\n",

      "Even though I’m an Orthodox Jew, I have a deep connection to Dorothy Day’s Catholic Worker movement. I volunteered at one of her “hospitality centers” a/k/a homeless shelters when I was in high school, and it was there that I was given the name of the man who would eventually become my first rabbi, Reb Shlomo Carlebach. I was also offered the chance to live there as a volunteer, but I did the conventional thing and went to college instead. What a mistake! I might have lived the life of spirituality and service I’d been searching for right away. Instead, I didn’t follow up with Reb Shlomo for another three years, and I never gave the Catholic Worker itself a second thought until very recently. Dorothy Day has been getting more notice lately. She was the subject of one chapter in ’ , and the Pope mentioned her in his address to Congress in 2015. Only then did I realize that the offer I’d received back then was part of a greater historic tradition of service. I’ve been both flattered and curious ever since. But to add something beyond my own personal interest, many say that the Pope’s public mention of her is an indication that she’s under consideration for canonization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of all that, I went into this biography expecting to read about a saint, but this book is anything but hagiographic. The author is Dorothy Day’s granddaughter, and she doesn’t shy away from showing her grandmother’s feet of clay. Dorothy’s own daughter, the author’s mother, had a rather harsh life as a result of her mother’s conversion. As a child, she had to share her with the many needy people who came through the Catholic Worker. Then she followed the Catholic prescriptions of marrying young and having lots of kids. She also followed the back-to-the-land prescriptions of Peter Maurin, the movement’s co-founder. While farming may seem romantic to urbanites like Dorothy and me, it’s much harder to actually live it, and this book shows how poorly the farms fared over the years. I wouldn’t have thought it possible, but I ended up admiring Tamar (the daughter) much more than Dorothy. It was my impression that Dorothy admired her more, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I read this book, I identified with Dorothy Day because had a bohemian youth and became religious, and I hoped the book would teach me how to incorporate left-wing values into religious practice. But what I discovered from the book was a different parallel to my life: the pitfalls of religious child-rearing. There’s nobody more gung-ho than a convert or , but in attempting to give over our values to our kids, we often end up causing them to resent those very same values. And yet, both Tamar and Kate (the author) love Dorothy and the Catholic Worker. So I can only conclude that religion is a complex matter. It appeals to the best side of us, but often, we and the others around us don’t measure up. What’s to be done about it? Be like Peter Maurin. Show your fellows forgiveness and patience. Everybody has a , even saints.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Dorothy Day is an interesting historical figure, the woman that founded The Catholic Worker, which was initially a combined newspaper, homeless shelter, and soup kitchen. I once subscribed to The Catholic Worker, and since it cost one penny per issue, you couldn’t beat the price. I saw this biography available and snapped it up from Net Galley; thanks go to them and Scribner, who provided me with a DRC in exchange for an honest review. This title was published in late January and is now available for purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always had a difficult time getting a handle on what The Catholic Worker stood for. The name suggests radicalism, and indeed, Day was red-baited during the McCarthy era. Day was a Catholic convert and a strong believer in sharing everything that she had with those that had nothing. She worked tirelessly and selflessly, and despite often living an impoverished existence somehow made it into her eighties before she died, an iconic crusader who became prominent when almost no women did so independently—though she was no feminist, and believed that wives should submit to husbands. Since her demise, speculation has arisen as to whether she might be canonized.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was that huge crash? Was it a marble statue being knocked the hell off its pedestal? Hennessy takes on the life and deeds of her famous grandmother with both frankness and affection. In the end, I came away liking Day a good deal less than I had when I knew little about her. Her tireless effort on behalf of the poor included anything and everything her very young daughter had in this world, and at one point she remarked that she felt unable to ask others to embrace a life of poverty if her child wasn’t also a part of that. It was a different time, one with no Children’s Protective Service to come swooping down and note that the child was sleeping in an unheated building in the midst of frigid winter; that there was no running water, since the building was a squat; that the only food that day was a single bowl of thin soup and perhaps a little hard bread donated from the day-old stores of local bakeries; that even small, personal treasures and clothing given the child by other relatives and friends would either be stolen by homeless denizens or even given away by her mother, a woman with the maternal instincts of an alley cat. Day did a lot of good for a lot of people, and no one can say she did it for her own material well being, but she more or less ruined her daughter’s life, and even when grown, Tamar’s painful social anxiety and panic attacks derailed her efforts to build a normal life for herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, the immense contribution that Day made at a time when the only homeless shelters were ones with a lot of rules and sometimes religious requirements cannot be overlooked. She is said to have had a commanding presence, endless energy (and the mood swings that accompany such energy in some people), and a mesmerizing speaking voice. Day’s physician also treated the great Cesar Chavez, and reflected that their personalities were a lot alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "I confess I was frustrated in reading this memoir, because I really just wanted the ideas behind the Catholic Worker laid out for me along with the organizational structure. Was the whole thing just whatever Day said it was at the moment, or was there democratic decision making? I never really found out, although I gained a sense that the chaotic events shown in the memoir reflected an unarticulated organizational chaos as well. This is a thing that sometimes happens with religious organizations; the material underpinnings are tossed up in the air for supernatural intervention, and the next thing they know, there’s an ugly letter from the IRS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only about half of this memoir was actually about Day; my sense was that the author did a lot of genealogical research and then decided to publish the result. The first twenty percent of the book is not only about Day’s various romantic entanglements; a significant portion of the text is mini-biographies of those men, and frankly, I wasn’t interested in them. I wanted to know about Day. Later I would be frustrated when long passages would be devoted to other relatives and their lives. Inclusion of daughter Tamar was essential, because Dorothy and Tamar were very close all their lives and shared a lot, and so in some ways to write about one was to tell about the other. But I didn’t need to know about Day’s in-laws, her many and several grandchildren, and so on. I just wanted to cut to the chase, but given the nature of the topic, also didn’t want to read Day’s own writing, which has a religious bias that doesn’t interest me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those with a keen interest in Dorothy Day and the Catholic Worker may want to read this, because not many books are available that discuss her life and work. On the other hand, I don’t advise paying full cover price. Get it free or at a deep discount, unless you are possessed of insatiable curiosity and deep pockets.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is an insider biography of Dorothy Day, a relational memoir of the mother-daughter relationship between the activist Day and her only living child, Tamar. Kate Hennessey, Day’s youngest granddaughter, explores the legacy of Day, not as the 20th century prophet, the social activist, the prolific writer who gave life to numerous communities of radical Gospel hospitality, simplicity and prayer, but as the single mother of a daughter who she never understood and often left feeling neglected, betrayed and diminished. Day is one of my personal heroes. I often wondered about her daughter, growing up in the shadow of such a formidable, uncompromising figure, in the midst of the chaos of the nascent Catholic Worker. This book gave me a very different picture of Day: flawed, domineering, able to be sensitive to the needs of broken strangers but dismissive of the needs of her own child, yet loved and loving despite that. This was a 4 star read for me because I was very interested in the central figures. Without that extreme interest, I think this would be a 3 star read.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A dreary book. The writing is dry and often stilted. Stories come across like a soda gone flat -- I can imagine they would have been more interesting had the writing been better.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author is, perhaps, too close to her subject to give a good account. To my taste, she spends waaaay too much time discussing her mother (Day's daughter) and father, not to mention her own life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciate getting a perspective of Day that is human, not hagiographical, but I have rarely read a more tedious book.\n",

That in itself made this collection really enjoyable for me.\n",

While Zaidi's other book Dongri to Dubai tackled Dawood Ibrahim and his rise, this book is about Maharashtrian Mobsters -Chota Rajan, Gawli and Rama Naik . Brilliantly researched, this is a must read for any body interested in the history and growth of Mumbai's dark underbelly.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Thank god, Hussain Zaidi has improved leaps and bounds in his writing skills, unlike the prequel to this book Dongri to Dubai, which felt like it was recycling of newspaper articles. The Book traces the evolution of Maharashtarians into underworld, and how so of them have started their own political parties now. This brief,racy and concise book is must, if you have no idea about Mumbai mobsters. The recurring theme in the book is how crony capitalism and inability of police to provide justice lead many young educated honest people to other side of the crime.\n",

It also talks about various police & political characters who have played a key role in the decimation or growth of the mafia.\n",

      "Key takeaways from this book\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Economics was the main reason for the mafia to have sprung. I mean economics combined with lack of governance. If police would have acted in some cases and not acted in others, many people wouldn't have ended up where they were.\n",

      "B. It is astonishing and completely unacceptable that a goon and a low life like Gawli could form a party and dream of becoming a politician after all his crimes. It is an abject failure of the system.\n",

      "Major Owen Hasbury returns from the Napoleonic Wars as the new Earl of Danbury. He’s ready to enjoy life and make love to as many women as he can before settling down and siring an heir.\n",
      "Louisa Goulding has a reputation as a bit of a bluestocking. She has served as her father’s hostess since her mother’s death years ago and has been an active part of the meetings in their home with her father’s War Office colleagues, giving her little time for social events. With the war over, Louisa wants to fully participate in the Season and finally live a life for herself, finding a husband who will give her children. At the insistence of mutual friends, Louisa and Owen meet. She calls him out as a rake, telling him she won’t waste any time on him. But her beauty and intelligence intrigue Owen. He becomes friends with Louisa, even teaching her how to kiss, finally realizing the perfect woman is right before him.\n",

Louisa is a strong woman who is intelligent, caring & totally smitten by Owen until they argue. Do they resolve their differences? Well it is a romance but their journey to their HEA had me devouring this lovely book\n",

      "Empowered by the Earl by Alexa Aston is the third book of the Second Sons of London. Major Owen Hasbury has returned from the Napoleonic Wars as the Earl of Danbury, a title he never expected to have as a second son. He is not ready to settle down, and much prefers life as a rake. This attitude bothers his two closest friends who have recently become happily married and wish the same for him. Louisa Goulding is a bluestocking. She has served as her father’s hostess and has had an active role in her father’s work for the War Office. Louisa doesn’t have much time for or care much for the Season, so when her cousins invite her to a house party, she goes. Louisa and Owen have mutual friends who insist on setting them up. Louisa doesn’t want to marry a rake, and she makes her opinion of Owen very clear to him. Despite this, Owen and Louisa begin a friendship that also features Owen teaching Louisa how to flirt—including how to kiss. Owen soon realizes the only man he wants Louisa to kiss—and marry— is him. He is determined to prove to Louisa that he is the one for her and that he has left his rakish ways behind.\n",

      "Louisa and Owen have great chemistry. I loved how Louisa became more confident because of Owen, and Owen started to believe in love because of Louisa. I also really enjoyed the side characters. I will definitely go back and read the prior books in the series!\n",

      "Louisa Goulding has seen her two beloved cousins marry, and start families, and she's ready for her own future. After years being hostess for her widowed father, she's finally having a Season for herself, with the hope of finding a partner, but none of the gentlemen have caught her eye. When she's invited to her cousin, Adalyn's, home for the winter, and to prepare for the birth of her child, she meets Major Owen Hasbury, friend of her in-laws, and newly minted Earl of Danbury. Owen plans on waiting to get married, but knows that Adalyn will likely start matchmaking, and when he and Louisa meet, it seems he was right. Though neither think the other will suit - Owen is too much of a rake, and Louisa wants to marry for love, and children - the longer they spend together, as friends, it's clear that they are struggling to not blur the line between love and friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since reading the first two books in the series, I've been waiting for Louisa's story, and am so glad with how it turned out. She's put herself on the shelf while being her father's hostess, and now ready to marry, the men she meets are too concerned about their wealth or looks, and don't want an intelligent, older woman to marry. She needs someone she can talk - and argue - with, and who will challenge her, and not expect her to be a trophy wife. Owen is perfect for that, though they don't have the best first impression, nor though they see each other are a credible partner. I loved that Owen seemed to fall harder, first, and he was willing to fight to show Louisa that he was the one for her, but also willing to step aside if she decided she didn't want him. He never took away her autonomy or freedom, and rather praised her mind and intelligence more than anything. I'm not sure what the next books will bring - I don't think we've met any of their main characters, but I'm looking forward to them!\n",

      "I’m so glad this was my first book of 2023– a story of hope, renewal, change for the better and the sweetest, purest happy ending. Jane Austen’s social commentary is unparalleled. The language and depth of understanding is breathtakingly beautiful. Genuine delight from start to finish. Every character became dear to my heart (except a few rogues, if you know, you know). Best declaration of love in English literature. Reading the words on a painstakingly crafted letter included in the book made it that much better! I’m so glad to have this edition in my library.\n",

It doesn't matter that I remembered exactly what would happen and when. From that moment that Anne and Wentworth meet up at the concert, the mounting emotion and tension swept me away once more, just as they did the first time I read it. Once more I was caught up in the tender, desperate romance, and I simply loved every minute of it.\n",

      "THE SERIES: Wynona Le Doux was born into the most powerful witch family in Hex Haven. Cursed at birth, she grew up without witchy powers, kept locked away in her cruel family’s castle. She was only supported by Granny Saffron, who taught her herb and plant use. When Wynona finally escaped her family, she started Saffron’s Tea House, specializing in custom teas.\n",

Just 6 days before opening, a dead body is found in her shop. Customers start cancelling appointments, and grumpy vampire Police Chief Ligurio is convinced Wynona is the killer. Soon there is another dead body. She must investigate. With no magic, Wynona needs the help of a dream team, but her team consists of Primrose (wingless fairy), Roderick (warlock and too-handsome landlord), and Violet (purple mouse).\n",

      "\n",
      "Wynona is a powerful witch whose powers were bound at birth, so she has no real magic, just an uncanny knack of knowing exactly the right herb mixture for each person's tea. Having escaped from her \"overprotective\" family, she's setting up a tea shop. Naturally someone is murdered. All the trappings for a regular cozy, paranormal mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wynona has a best friend, a fairy named Primrose, but the relationship isn't really explored. We get more interaction between Wynona and her newly adopted mouse. As expected, the first two eligible bachelors who meet Wynona start flirting. The first is her landlord. For my money, he was quite over the top with praising and touching her - after just meeting. \"She could feel his large presence move around the table and stop at her side before long fingers tucked under her chin, forcing her to look up at him.\" Yuck!! Creep alert. \"From the moment I saw you, I knew you were special.\"\n",
      "Seriously, not realistic. People may feel that way, but to actually say it within days (less than a week) of meeting, I didn't like it. The relationship with the second bachelor, the investigating cop, is more realistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still there was something missing. I think it's personal, from Wynona's perspective. All her interactions seem similar, but we don't get any private, BFF time with Prim. The only real personal information about Wynona comes from her inner monologues. Basically we don't get to know her as a friend. That's something helpful when grabbing the reader's attention. I may also have a problem with the constant reminders that she was emotionally abused and didn't have any powers. I will try the next book to see what happens.\n",

      "Snowberry Creek is gearing up for the annual Halloween festival and Abby McCree, the committee queen, is busy with the preparations. When she heads out to pick up an order of pumpkins from the least popular guy in town, Ronald Minter, she discovers his body in a corn maze with a knife in his back.\n",

      "Abby gets sucked deeper into the investigation when her tenant, Tripp, volunteers her for yet another planning committee, a fundraiser for his veteran’s group. As it turns out, one Tripp’s buddy's, a homeless vet, named Kevin, has become suspect number one. Knowing Kevin is innocent, Abby sets out to find out who the real killer is.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m in a cozy mystery mood and in the mood for Halloween themed novels, too, which made this book an obvious choice. Although it is the second book in this new series, it can easily be read as a stand-alone, so if you are looking for a fall/Halloween mystery, just dive right in. But, if you are like me, you’ll want to go back and read the first installment and continue with the series from here.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the characters are in the early stages of their developments, I can see a lot of potential and room for growth. The most intriguing character, for me, was Tripp. The mystery is very solid, with several likely suspects to keep one guessing. Abby’s amateur sleuthing is on the practical side, thankfully, avoiding any insult to my intelligence. I also liked her faithful dog companion, Zeke, as he plays a big role in the story and melted my heart more than once.\n",

As with most cozy series each book in the Abby McCree Mystery series has it’s own mystery that is solved within the book so each can be read in any order or as a standalone if choosing to do so. Those that follow along from the beginning of the series will have some character development that carries over from book to book though.\n",

Needing a fresh start Abby decided to move into her Aunts former home and make it her own in small town Snowberry Creek, Washington. After arriving in the small town Abby found herself surrounded by her aunt’s old friends who are turning to her to fill the hole that her aunt had also left in their lives and trying to get Abby to volunteer for project after project.\n",

She goes on an errand to pick up pumpkins for the festival only to find the farmer killed in his corn maze. The police immediately suspect Tripp's friend, a homeless veteran named Kevin, who was seen arguing with the farmer. Tripp, convinced of his friend's innocence, goes to great lengths to protect him from the police, resulting in him being arrested. Abby is determined to find the real killer to get Tripp out of jail.

To be watching out for her daughter as well, and having to trust her to other's care at times, I could appreciate the fear she felt doing that. To give up your family and friends and support system at a time you need them the most must be difficult. Shirlee McCoy did a great job showing that side of it.

Although it is the second book in this new series, it can easily be read as a stand-alone, so if you are looking for a fall/Halloween mystery, just dive right in. But, if you are like me, you’ll want to go back and read the first installment and continue with the series from here.\n",

      "While the characters are in the early stages of their developments, I can see a lot of potential and room for growth. The most intriguing character, for me, was Tripp. The mystery is very solid, with several likely suspects to keep one guessing. Abby’s amateur sleuthing is on the practical side, thankfully, avoiding any insult to my intelligence. I also liked her faithful dog companion, Zeke, as he plays a big role in the story and melted my heart more than once.\n",

The ladies from the quilting group are always there to help, advise or butt in as needed.\n",

      "The author has written a strong mystery too. I was pulled in many different directions over the course of the novel. I knew in my heart who it couldn’t be but I would be lying if I didn’t tell you I was totally surprised by the big reveal. Alexis Morgan expertly pens a slow build the rachets up at a delightful pace all leading up a dramatic ending. She describes everything so clearly readers can feel like they are right there on the spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really have to applaud the author for the way she addressed homeless veterans and veterans, in general, dealing with veterans with PTSD and finding their way back in the world after surviving horrendous things can be a rough road. Many in Snowberry Creek were on the wrong side of this issue but thankfully there were those willing to help, some veterans themselves. Putting a hot topic issue like this into a work of fiction makes it more real and relevant.\n",

      "The only book that chronicles the history of Mumbai's underworld in such graphic detail. While Zaidi's other book Dongri to Dubai tackled Dawood Ibrahim and his rise, this book is about Maharashtrian Mobsters -Chota Rajan, Gawli and Rama Naik . Brilliantly researched, this is a must read for any body interested in the history and growth of Mumbai's dark underbelly.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Thank god, Hussain Zaidi has improved leaps and bounds in his writing skills, unlike the prequel to this book Dongri to Dubai, which felt like it was recycling of newspaper articles. The Book traces the evolution of Maharashtarians into underworld, and how so of them have started their own political parties now. This brief,racy and concise book is must, if you have no idea about Mumbai mobsters. The recurring theme in the book is how crony capitalism and inability of police to provide justice lead many young educated honest people to other side of the crime.\n",

      "This is the so called sequel to the book \"Dongri to Dubai\" by the author Zaidi.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book starts of with a racy encounter ending in the death of a dreaded mafia guy. This book talks about the home grown Maharashtrian gangs. The main characters are Arun Gawli, Chotta Rajan & Naik, including others of some importance. It also talks about various police & political characters who have played a key role in the decimation or growth of the mafia.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had earlier reviewed \"Dongri to Dubai\" & would like to state that the writing style of the author is extremely readable and interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author with his background as a crime reporter has got all the juicy tit bits of information, including the killers eccentricities and beliefs. The best e.g. would be of Thakur, who was a vegetarian teetotaller. A firm bhakt of Lord Shiva and an honourable one at that!!!\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "A. It is extremely readable and doesnt bore the reader. Not one page is boring.\n",

      "B. The amount of research that has gone into this book shows, when small and delightful details are added in between.\n",

      "C. It gives us a big picture of the how and why of mafia growth.\n",

      "D. This book is an important part of our history, that is presented in an extremely interesting manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "What i did not like about the book\n",
      "\n",
      "A. The bias in this book as well his earlier one towards Dawood is visible in a very subtle manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "B. Importance has been given to the role of Shiv Sena and BJP, but Cong has been totally leftout with respect to its role in enabling the mafia. Especially the role of Sharad Pawar.\n",
      "\n",
      "C. There were a lot of pages which read more like fiction that reality, this could have been avoided.\n",
      "\n",
      "D. Last but most important, pictures of all characters should have been given. Some of the pics in the book are actually useless in the extreme. e.g. pics of a durga puja pandal!!!! Really Mr Zaidi\n",
      "\n",
      "Key takeaways from this book\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Economics was the main reason for the mafia to have sprung. I mean economics combined with lack of governance. If police would have acted in some cases and not acted in others, many people wouldn't have ended up where they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "B. It is astonishing and completely unacceptable that a goon and a low life like Gawli could form a party and dream of becoming a politician after all his crimes. It is an abject failure of the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "C. Our institutions are absolutely not people friendly nor do they operate with SLAs. If this can be changed, lot more crime can be prevented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not the least, however cool they sound in the movies or look awesome. These bastards should be treated as vermin and not some hot bodies hunks, Which bollywood has done in quite a number of ways. Best e.g. is of Manya surve in real life and Manya surve in reel life.\n",

      "Generally, I love all of Hussain Zaidi's books - this was no exception. Like his other books, it follows the lives of the gangsters of India (namely Maharashtra in this one). As always, I enjoyed the stories. However, I gave this a 3/5 because the skipping between stories became very frustrating and made it hard to retain interest. Also, the final 50 pages were rushed and very tedious to get through. Overall, it was what I expected.\n",

Ale hlavně skvěle zachycuje myšlenkový pochod kluka ve školním věku, kdy si každý takový kluk říká, že je přece už velký, snaží se chovat dospěle a vyjadřovat se dospěle, o což se Péťa Bajza snaží, ale s jeho klukovským vnímáním světa to vyzní humorně a velmi roztomile.

      "This is the first book in \"A Five-Ingredient Mystery Series\". The protaganist, Val Deniston has lost her job as a publicist for cookbooks and chefs after a serious car accident, so she has come home to Chesapeake Bay. She has been asked by her mother to assist her grandfather in fixing up his old Colonial House so that he can sell it. She gets a job as the manager of the Cool Down Cafe at the local tennis club. Managing the cafe and playing on the local tennis team, Val quickly gets to know a lot of the people in the small town. Most small towns are the same when it comes to eveyone's business. When Val's cousin, Monique gets an anonymous letter that her husband Maverick is having an affair with local real estate agent and tennis club member Nadia, she loses it in front of many tennis club members. When Val goes to Nadia's home to meet her about a catering job, she finds her dead, stabbed by a sharpened wooden tennis racket. When Val realizes that Moniqe will be the prime suspect, she starts to investigate the murder on her own. Val puts herself at risk and accidents start to happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Val's grandfather is a hoot. When Gunnar, a tourist who might be moving to Chesapeake Bay starts to show an interest in Val, he tries his best to keep them away from one another in his not so subtle way. When he applies for a job as a columnist for the local paper writing a food column, he gets the job. He calls himself the \"Codger Cook\" and uses Val's recipes, with some minor changes for his column. There are many other characters introduced in this book that I hope will play a larger role in future books.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are eight recipes are at the back all made from five ingredients. Enjoy! You know you'll want to cook them because they look simple and delicious. A cozy mystery lover, who also loves food in their stories will really enjoy this book. I am looking forward to the next one in this series. This is a solid 4.5 star read for me.\n",

      "Val Deniston is hoping to turn her gig at the athletic club snack bar into a catering gig, but when she shows up to meet with Nadia, she finds the woman stabbed on her kitchen floor. With the police focusing on Val’s cousin, she needs to sort through the suspects and find out who had the perfect recipe for murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "What intrigued me the most about this book was the five refrain, I knew there would be five suspects and five clues. I was wondering how the author would pull it off without having to fill page time. She did it beautifully. There was always something happening that kept me engaged, and the way she pulled things together at the end was brilliant. I did have a bit of a hard time warming up to the characters, and the data dump early on didn’t help, but by the end I had grown to like them. I can’t wait to meet up with them again in another book.\n",

      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "OK, I did not finish this book. I could only manage about 1/3 before I finally had to give up on it; my little kobo reader could not have survived me throwing it across the room so I had to put the book down to save the reader.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book is ridiculous.\n",
      "E.g.\n",
      "Monique: 'Oh, I admitted to committing a crime and then - gasp! - the police treated me like a criminal!'.\n",
      "Val's friend: 'Well, given that we are a baker and teacher, we must be better equipped than the law enforcement personnel who have training and experience in investigating crimes.'\n",
      "Val: 'that must be especially true since they treated my cousin like a criminal after she admitted to committing a crime'\n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously?!?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from that, using PTSD as a foreshadowing, 'create tension and suspense' plot teaser is insulting and offensive to anyone with PTSD, CPTSD or basic human decency. Yes, PTSD can be included in a plot in a way that adds to character and story development in a respectful way, perhaps even one that brings greater understanding about the disorders (see for example, Jacqueline Winspear's A Dangerous Place). However, to use it as a cheap plot trick, in lieu of actual quality writing I might add, is just plain disrespectful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I am happy that I can return this one to the library and move on to other books. I will not be checking out others of this series. In fact, I am not sure if I will read anymore cozy mysteries for a very long time after this.\n",
      "Review 5\n",

      "With tennis, vying for manager of the Cool Down Cafe, and trying to sell real estate, there are some pretty serious competitions going on in this book.\n",

      "When one of the woman from the local tennis club is found murdered, there’s also an unsolved hit-and -run, and some arson going on and it may all tie together, or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bet Val didn’t expect to be helping the police with a murder when she left New York City behind to move in with her grumpy grandfather in the small town of Bayport in Chesapeake Bay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Managing the cafe and playing on the local tennis team, Val quickly gets to know a lot of the people in this small town. And like most small towns, it’s hard to keep a secret and the gossip is rampant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Val is drawn into the murder investigation when she discovers the body of a fellow tennis player. And the number one suspect is her cousin. Not wanting to believe her capable of murder, Val starts her own investigation, but being a stickler, she doesn’t scratch her cousin off the list of suspects. And that list is long.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Val’s suspect list shrinks, the danger escalates. She’s being stalked and someone ran her off the road. She’s getting close, but to which case. The hit-and-run, the arson, the murder, or all three?\n",
      "\n",
      "The author had me going in circles trying to figure out who the killer was. It wasn’t obvious. There were lots of false trails. And I didn’t have a clue until about two thirds of the way through the book. There was still a ways to go so I knew things could change and have me suspecting someone else, so I paid close attention, sniffing for clues.\n",
      "\n",
      "This cozy mystery had a lot to offer. Several mysteries, lots of colorful characters, danger, and romance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Val and Gunnar are flirting with a burgeoning romance. This wasn’t the main focus in the mystery, just a dollop of whipped cream to add zest, and it’s early in the romance stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Val has her own personal mystery to solve too. Her memory of the car crash that ended her budding career in New York is still not clear. Did she cause the crash or was it an accident?\n",
      "\n",
      "Lots of questions and the author gave me the answers bit by bit. There was no rush to wrap this up, and the ending left me happy and eager for more.\n",

But now that the tables are starting to turn and he is really starting to feel the woman that he bought to marry.... His dad and grandfather have something to say again... It is like he cant win...

      "What can I say about this except I adore the trope of falling for your best friend’s brother, and this was really no different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sebastian and his bestie have been sorta kind avoiding adulthood for several years now, just being academic nerds and getting various degrees here and there. Their vagabond existence comes to a temporary pause for the summer as they can’t resist a free room offered by Bella’s older brother Asa, a handsome rich contractor who’s newly divorced. What comes about is that Sebastian and Bella’s self imposed personal family of two broadly expands, and they both realize that maybe establishing some roots or reconnecting with loved ones is not such a bad thing after all. How long will Sebastian remain stubborn and deny his and Asa’s wants and needs?\n",
      "\n",
      "This had a lot funny in it, a gentle giant, an age gap, and some very nice UST. Thankfully, there was no crazy angst that can be prominent in many of Lane’s works. Throw in an adorable 7 year old, the aforementioned fierce bestie, and this was nice and easy entertaining romance!\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "3.5 Stars\n",
      "\n",
      "As one of Lane’s earlier works, I wasn’t expecting too much, if truth me told. What I got was a heartwarming, lite-angst tale, of two fairly lonely men unexpectedly falling in love while sharing a home one summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a best-friends-brother trope well-executed, with the best friend and sister Bella playing a nice, supportive role to our two MCs, Sebastian Craig and Asa Bryne. The whole story had a strong family-vibe which I loved, with Sebastian being wholly welcomed by the entire Bryne clan, always, first as Bella’s friend and later as Asa’s lover, making the stakes a little higher for Sebastian in what he could potentially lose if his romance with Asa went pear-shaped.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the romance ran fairly smooth, with little in the way of complications, as Sebastian and Asa shared a sweet connection and a strong sexual chemistry. The little relationship drama we do experience here was towards the end, revolving around whether Sebastian would stay forever with Asa (and his young son Jordan) or if he’d move interstate to complete another college degree. To be honest, this part felt a bit forced and certainly dragged the story out a bit longer than was strictly necessary, IMO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I liked the story and the characters well enough, but I wasn’t wowed by their romance. It was a decent best-friends-brother story, if, like me, you’re into such, but I’ve read better stories like this, and I’ve certainly read better stories by Lane herself. But it was still a nice way to pass the time.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is where I should try to believe that \"Don't Judge The Book By Its Cover\" :). I was reluctant to read this at first, since based on the cover (and the blurb here mentioned \"Neverland of academia\"), I thought it would be a fantasy story -- and I wasn't in the mood to read fantasy; as well as it wasn't my first choice of genre.\n",
      "\n",
      "HOWEVER, it turns out that this is a contemporary romance, a very good and humorous and tender one to boot. It's very easy to read and totally entertaining. It also features some of the most wonderful people in a story -- Sebastian, a 27-year old doctorate candidate, his best-friend (and probably soul-mate), Bella, Bella's older but oh-my-god-so-sexy brother, Asa (I keep imagining him as Alexander Skarsgård), and Asa's 8-year-old song the quiet-bug-lover Jordan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationship is down-right \"Earthly\" (can I use that term?); it's fun but also touching -- I admit I cried during a couple of scenes, mostly related to Jordan (I want to hug that kid) -- sort of like a heartwarming Hallmark movie. The dialogs are so easy to read and the banters between Sebastian and Bella are sometimes outrageous but you can simply see how that describes the closeness. I must say that this is for the first time, I enjoy a female character that seems to be as important as the male characters. Oh, there are some female \"friends\" in several stories I read, but Sebastian and Bella are more than just friends. They're support each other through everything -- they're probably siblings separated by blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "I totally enjoy Sebastian's rambling -- and how Asa's way to quiet him (very effective :p). I have to admit that at some points I feel that Asa's presence is overshadowed by Sebastian's relationship with Bella. But, it's not such a big problem :). Of course, at the end, I want to smack Sebastian for not seeing what he has and that it needs chicken pox to make him realize that he belongs with Bella and her brother and his son.\n",
      "\n",
      "The extra 0.5 stars belong to Bella as an important character in an m/m story as well as Jordan, because I want to squeeze him for being so sweet (though he can also be manipulative :p)\n",

      "What a fabulous story. Sebastian and Bella, true friends, even though he does sometimes call her 'heifer' as a term of endearment. Sebastian is a very flamboyant gay, and doesn't care who knows it! Let's just say that their personal lives are not particularly successful, neither of them currently has a lover, and to make up for that, and the fact that Sebastian's upbringing was not particularly happy, he has been 'adopted' by Bella's family, who are of course full of warmth and love. He and Bella spend all the time they can with Bella's siblings and their children, but Sebastian does have a plan - he is going to University to obtain another Doctorate in a subject he feels strongly about, so he is transferring his book store job to one nearer where he will be studying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enter Asa, Bella's oldest brother and keeper of her secrets, single parent and father of Jordan. Words fail me!!\n",
      "He is such a lovely man, and when Bella and Sebastian go to stay at his house, Sebastian falls under his spell straight away. He assumes Asa will not be interested in him - that assumption would be INcorrect! Asa is bi, and even though he hasn't had relationship with a man before, he has been tempted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matters progress, and Sebastian comes to understand that his 'unrequited' feelings for Asa may not be as unrequited as he thought!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jordan is perfectly happy with Sebastian, and spends a lot of time with him and Bella while Asa is working. Jordan is fascinated with reptiles and animals of any description. .\n",
      "\n",
      "Things are fine, Asa and Sebastian are definitely falling for each other, but of course, nothing is said out loud!! Time comes for Sebastian to start thinking about his move to Uni, and of course, he's having second thoughts but doesn't say anything. Asa doesn't want him to go, but doesn't feel as though he can interfere because this is what Sebastian has been dreaming of for years, and won't be the one to block his plans. So even though they really are in love and have been sharing a bed for a while, Sebastian goes off to Uni, and of course the dreaded chickenpox strikes!! Jordan is unwell, but of course Asa gets it too, and as anyone who's had chickenpox as an adult will tell you, it's really not very nice!! Bella is looking after them both but is exhausted, so Sebastian does the only thing he can do - he comes home and takes over from Bella.\n",
      "Needless to say, he doesn't go back to Spokane to finish his course.\n",

      "\n",
      "But 27 year old Sebastian has done everything in his power not to grow up, so he had planned to continue with his education after the summer. But then he has to leave Asa and his son, Jordan, behind…\n",
      "\n",
      "Sebastian was pretty cute with his foot in mouth decease. I liked how there was no real angst within the relationship. These guys just hit it off and went for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also liked Jordan, the kid, although for once it would have been nice to have a 7 year old boy act out instead of saying his heart is broken and be quiet (like an adult would do).\n",
      "\n",
      "My experience with 7 year olds (I actually have one right now), is that they are not the best in explaining how they feel. They get angry or walk away when they feel hurt. And if they have an unstable parent I doubt they will just be quiet and get over it, like Jordan did in this.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a divorced mother of 3 boys, who all have experience with a mentally unstable parent, I can tell you, it’s not easy! Frustration and anger are the main emotions at that age.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish all kids talked and acted like grown-ups, but in RL they almost never do….\n",

      "TOUCHED BY LOVE is the sixth book in the Love in Bloom: The Remingtons series. As a new fan of Melissa Foster’s I’ve been loving reading all these new books by her. As you can tell by the series name, all her books are connected somehow and they are almost always spin offs from another series. However, as I haven’t read any of the other books in this particular series yet, I still believe that you can read this as a standalone.\n",
      "\n",
      "From reading a handful of Foster’s books it’s clear to see that she loves writing her romances. I can’t think of another author who really takes the time like Foster does to build that romance from the ground up. Every page, every word is there to make the reader fall in love alongside the characters and Foster is really able to cement the fact that these two characters belong to one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Janie Jansen is a very independent and strong heroine who also happens to be blind. While authors tend to describe their characters as a “blind heroine” etc., Foster really makes sure that there is depth to Janie and strives to prove that the disability she has doesn’t define her. Janie is in no way shape or form in need of help.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when she stumbles in the subway and has a near death experiment, Firefighter Boyd Hudson is there to offer a hand. At first, Janie is quite hesitant to offer help but Boyd proves that his intentions are all pure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between the two, there are plenty of jokes and flirting, which does an amazing job of not only building the romance, but it cuts the tension of the situation a little bit so that there is room to grow. As we start to see Janie falling for Boyd, readers get swept up in the romance while also learning something along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "TOUCHED BY LOVE really is a touching love story that will no doubt have readers wishing for more.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Have you ever read a book that changed you? That made you see everything in a different light? That made you feel way more for its characters than you ever thought possible? Touched by Love is that book for me. It is so powerful, so raw and so real.\n",
      "Boyd Hudson went through a horrible tragedy as a child that no one should ever have to go through. Blaming himself for what he and his family endured, his scars, both physically and emotionally, run so deep that he has spent his entire adult life keeping a secret from those he loves the most.\n",
      "Janie Jansen was diagnosed with a degenerative eye disease as a child. While she could still see some light, she knew that one day, that too would be gone. Having grown up with over protective parents, Janie is determined to live her life as independently as humanly possible.\n",
      "I don't say this lightly, but this is without out a doubt, my favorite book that I have ever had the pleasure to read.\n",

      "This is one of my favorite by far! Boyd and Janie are amazing. Alone. Together. With their friends. Their story touched my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boyd is a paramedic/firefighter/tech consultant/wanna-be doctor who meets Janie and is instantly attracted but he tries to stay away from her. Janie is a writer for the tech company and is blind. But for her it's not about her disability, it's about her independence. When Janie stays late at work one night, she and Boyd make a silly bet. When they leave the office, Janie heads to the subway and trips and falls into the subway tracks. She gets out but is injured. Boyd realized he still had Janie's phone and went to return it...sees that she's hurt and gets her to the hospital. From there they form a bond that quickly turns to love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boyd is trying to get in to medical school and he's applied all around the country. But now that he has found Janie, how can he leave her? Janie is comfortable with her place in NY with her best friend right next door. Can he take her away from all she knows to be with him? Does Janie even want to move? Can they find their way navigating Janie's dark world with Boyd's world of sight?\n",
      "\n",
      "Melissa wrote a fantastic book about love and disabilities. Her research was thorough and thoughtful. Fantastic read!\n",

      "Quirky would be the best word to describe this book. Wynona is a relatable character who feels like an outcast, and this will resonate with readers.\n",

      "*spoilers ahead*\n",
      "\n",
      "Wynona is a witch - ish. She ‘lost’ her powers when they were bound when she was born. Her grandmother helped her escape her family who apparently were a bunch of powerful assholes. Her dad is the President but never spoke about her because she doesn’t have powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "She moves to a new town and plans to open a tea shop. But the chef who is supposed to supply her tea shop with pastries is found dead in her office and suddenly she is in a semi-love triangle with a cold one and a hot one (who happens to be a shapeshifting werewolf) SOUND FAMILIAR??\n",
      "\n",
      "She has a new janitor who is small and grumbles all the time just like Kreacher in Harry Potter.\n",

      "All clues point to… the killer. Yep. Super predictable. I figured out who it was before the body even dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise the story is cute. We all know she really does have powers. Otherwise why all the ‘purple’? The mouse, the sparks at the end etc. I will probably read the second in the series to see if it gets any better.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I thought the book was a cute intro to a mystery series. It has an interesting look at the weird and different that is hex haven. The protagonist has her own troubles she’s dealing with and needs to solve the murders to help keep them at bay. Plus there’s a cute cop.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "“Murder by the Cup” (Le Doux Mysteries #1) by Abigail Lynn Thornton ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Genre: Paranormal Cozy Mystery. Location: The town of Hex Haven. TIme: Present.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She's always been her family's dirty little secret, but now she's finally free...”\n",
      "\n",
      "THE SERIES: Wynona Le Doux was born into the most powerful witch family in Hex Haven. Cursed at birth, she grew up without witchy powers, kept locked away in her cruel family’s castle. She was only supported by Granny Saffron, who taught her herb and plant use. When Wynona finally escaped her family, she started Saffron’s Tea House, specializing in custom teas.\n",
      "\n",
      "THIS BOOK: Looking forward to the grand opening of Saffron’s Tea House, Wynona has convinced gnome Chef Droxon to supply her with pastries. Just 6 days before opening, a dead body is found in her shop. Customers start cancelling appointments, and grumpy vampire Police Chief Ligurio is convinced Wynona is the killer. Soon there is another dead body. She must investigate. With no magic, Wynona needs the help of a dream team, but her team consists of Primrose (wingless fairy), Roderick (warlock and too-handsome landlord), and Violet (purple mouse).\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Wynona grew up isolated and lacks experience in romance, author Thornton adds an appropriately gentle love triangle consisting of dark-haired Wynona, warlock Roderick with his blond hair and cool silvery eyes, and wolf shapeshifter Rascal with his messy brown hair and hot golden eyes (and he’s the deputy police chief).\n",
      "\n",
      "Thornton’s writing is consistent across the book. For example, Wynona learned to control her emotions around her cruel family, so Thornton writes her as always polite and appearing calm, even when she’s seething inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a light-hearted romp through a town full of magic and diverse species. It’s the perfect definition of a paranormal cozy mystery, and it’s 5 stars from me. Thank you @authorabigaillynnthornton for this free kindle book!\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I had dropped three books for not interesting me, when I started this one. I immediately was drawn in. The writing is fun and compelling. However, further reading left me interested but unsatisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wynona is a powerful witch whose powers were bound at birth, so she has no real magic, just an uncanny knack of knowing exactly the right herb mixture for each person's tea. Having escaped from her \"overprotective\" family, she's setting up a tea shop. Naturally someone is murdered. All the trappings for a regular cozy, paranormal mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wynona has a best friend, a fairy named Primrose, but the relationship isn't really explored. We get more interaction between Wynona and her newly adopted mouse. As expected, the first two eligible bachelors who meet Wynona start flirting. The first is her landlord. For my money, he was quite over the top with praising and touching her - after just meeting. \"She could feel his large presence move around the table and stop at her side before long fingers tucked under her chin, forcing her to look up at him.\" Yuck!! Creep alert. \"From the moment I saw you, I knew you were special.\"\n",
      "Seriously, not realistic. People may feel that way, but to actually say it within days (less than a week) of meeting, I didn't like it. The relationship with the second bachelor, the investigating cop, is more realistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still there was something missing. I think it's personal, from Wynona's perspective. All her interactions seem similar, but we don't get any private, BFF time with Prim. The only real personal information about Wynona comes from her inner monologues. Basically we don't get to know her as a friend. That's something helpful when grabbing the reader's attention. I may also have a problem with the constant reminders that she was emotionally abused and didn't have any powers. I will try the next book to see what happens.\n",

      "Botanical Shakespeare is, as its title says, a botanical compendium of William Shakespeare’s quotes from his plays and poems. It is a beautifully illustrated book with astounding botanical paintings –by Sumié Hasegawa– of each plant, flower, fruit, tree… mentioned in every Shakespeare’s work accompanied by his quotes, indicating the source –i.e. character, play, and act–, but it is not a book meant to be read traditionally. I think it is more of a coffee table book to enjoy little by little or have a glance at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although it is indeed a lovely book (probably one of the most beautiful books I own) and a perfect gift for Bardolators, I would have liked the information about the plants – section– gathered at the end, had matched up with each illustration. I also missed additional historical information and context, and if the index sections available at the had been included, it would have been a more well-rounded edition.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, some quotes turned out to be somewhat repetitive, and although I found some errors in the references, the book as a whole is very pleasing, and it shows it was carried out with extensive research work.\n",

      "It basically is as the title says. Each plant, flower, leaf etc is accompanied by quotes from Shakespeare citing the character, play and act. It opens with a short introduction on botanicals and their rise during the Elizabethan era and at the end there is a listing with definitions.\n",

      "This isn’t one that I would buy as an ebook due to the exquisite binding and heavy ivory stock used to produce it. Oh one day a copy will be mine!\n",

      "Absolutely GORGEOUS book. Everything from the cover to the font to, most obviously, the exquisite illustrations by Sumie Hasegawa Collins. Even if I wasn't interested in the Shakespeare quotes (which I am to varying degrees), I want to own this book to look at it all the time.\n",

      "The well-researched Botanical Shakespeare by Gerit Quealy, a Goodreads First Reads book, is filled with beautiful botanical illustrations by Sumie Hasegawa-Collins. Each plant in this collection was selected from references in Shakespeare's plays and sonnets, is illustrated, and further, includes other names by which this plant was known or referred to in Shakespeare's works, i.e. Adonis Flower is also called Fritillary (p. 12) and the Pansy, \"Love-in-idleness\" and \"Cupid's Flower\" (p. 132).\n",
      "\n",
      "The glossary at the end of the book, \"Botanicals Defined,\" is chock full of fascinating information about each plant: what it is; how it was used; and some history, and interpretations. The bibliography and other information is available through the website: .\n",
      "\n",
      "This collection is one to be read slowly and savored. I am, perhaps, like most people: familiar with Shakespeare's most popular works. I knew, for example, that Midsummer's Night Dream contained many plant references, but \"...a rose by any other name...\" from Romeo and Juliet was the only flower reference that came immediately to my mind. Yet there are dozens of other rose references in as the many different works.\n",

      "Wings of Dragca is the fifth and final installment of the Protected by Dragons series. In it, you will still see the same gang of people that you've met in the first book. However, there's a crap ton of danger in this book. There a lot of action and I was so worried about how this was all going to end - luckily, it ended on a happy note.\n",

      "\n",
      "Poor Elias got the really really short end of the stick in the series, and I feel so bad for him! His and Isola's relationship was probably the hardest to get to normal (even Thorne's was easier than his!) Which sucks because he was probably my favorite of the four. I'm glad that everything worked out for him in the end and they all got their happy ending <3\n",

I have been hooked on this series since book one and it has been building to this fantastic conclusion that was not disappointing meeting all of my expectations but now it has come to an end. All the lingering questions have been answered along with a truly impressive final battle. The epilogue is just too sweet and makes you look forward to future books that may tie into this world even if there are other main characters.

      "Series Note:\n",
      "Second book in the \"Dead By\" trilogy and 12th book involving the character of Griffin Powell. These books are romantic suspense usually involving a serial killer and Powell's security/investigative agency. There's a whole lot of back story to these books and there are probably others you should read first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary:\n",
      "There is a killer who is hunting down killing agents of the Powell Agency and members of their families. Griffin Powell is convinced the killer an evil, sadistic bastard from his past, but he doesn't see how that can be possible since the man is dead. He sets two of his best agents, Derek Lawrence and Maleah Purdue to investigate every lead possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Maleah and Derek try to figure out who is killing those connected with the Powell Agency, more and more people die. They have to unwind a twisted puzzle of leads and misleads before someone else loses their life. In the process, secrets are revealed that could destroy lives and Maleah and Derek realize they can turn to each other during these tough times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Review:\n",
      "I debated quite a bit with myself over whether I wanted to write a review for this book. It seems almost disrespectful to write a critical review of a book whose author passed away not long after it was published. But I don't write my reviews to be malicious. I just give my honest opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've read a lot of Beverly Barton's books and she used to be a romantic suspense author that I eagerly awaited each new book. But then her books began to change, involving less and less romance and more straight-up suspense. What romance there was came off underdeveloped and forced. For me, that didn't work. I'm a fan of romantic suspense. I don't mind if the suspense part is the more dominant aspect but I still want a solid romance to go with it. And Barton's book started to miss on that point. It was very disappointing from an author who used to tell such great romantic suspense stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I wouldn't have read this book (and wouldn't read the one that follows this one) if it were for the fact that I've read a number of the Griffin Powell books and really want to know the rest of Griff's story. That's really the only reason I bought this one. I would have passed otherwise because Barton's type of romantic suspense just didn't work for me anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "And even after I bought it I still held off on reading it because I heard there was a huge cliffhanger at the end and I wanted to have the next book first so I wouldn't have to read a cliffhanger and then wait for the next book. Of course, Ms. Barton passed away after this book came out and fans were left wondering if the next book would come. Thankfully, she had already finished the next book, the final one in the \"Dead By\" trilogy, , which supposedly wraps-up the Griffin Powell mystery. So I bought that one, too, so I could read them back to back. And yet I left them sitting on my shelf because I couldn't muster up much enthusiasm to read them. I finally made myself get to them, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't say, after finishing this book, that my feelings changed on the way Barton had shifted the writing of her \"romantic suspense\" books. \"Dead By Morning\" came off pretty much as I expected it would. The suspense plot completely dominated and the \"romance\" came off more as a sidenote that was plopped in so the book could still be called a romantic suspense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the suspense plot was the dominating part of the story, I'll start with that. It was an okay plot. A bit low key in some ways. Very procedural with interviews and traveling around, etc etc. I wouldn't have minded some more action to keep my attention focused.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I didn't like about the suspense plot was that it made me think to much of \"Silence of the Lambs,\" specifically the part about Clarice interviewing Hannibal Lecter and him requiring her to tell him personal details in order for him to help her on the case. You get a repeat of that in this book. It just struck me as rather unoriginal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also didn't like another detail, and it's something that's bothered me for a number of Barton's recent books now. And that's how she gives you character POV's for people who are soon to be off'ed. And not just little tidbits, but whole scenes of characters living happy lives, letting you get to know them, like them, and then they get butchered. I just have not liked that aspect of her recent books and I really didn't like it in this one. It's almost a bit cruel. There was one in particular in this book that I was very bothered by. It just really drops down my enjoyment of the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's the fact that if you haven't read some of the other Griffin Powell books, especially the one about Griff and Nic, , you'll probably end up a bit confused about all the references to Griff's past. There's just a lot of backstory going on there. It wasn't an issue for me since I've read those books but I can see how others would end up confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, the suspense plot is pretty average. I've read ones a lot better, and I've read ones a lot worse. It's a twisted story and when you finish, you don't have a lot of answers because the book basically continues right into the next one with a cliffhanger ending. Which makes me glad I have it waiting for me to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the romance...I'm tempted to say, what romance? But I can't because there is enough of one to say there is a romance, but for me, it was a rather flat and lackluster one. Maleah isn't entirely likable. She's very judgmental toward's Derek, getting offended by the smallest niceties, like opening a door for her. She's antagonistic toward him for a good chunk of the book. And when things shift between them, it comes off as weird and forced. I just didn't not feel the connection. When they jump to the next level near the end, things go at mach speed and I was left shaking my head, not believing the supposed romance between them. This part of the book could have been so much better and it's disappointing because Barton has written great romances in her books in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a technical note, I was also distracted at times by the over attention to detail. You'd get a whole paragraph over something as simple as opening a door or some other mundane task. It was irritating because it was overkill and unnecessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, not a very positive review, I admit. It was a book that didn't really do it for me. But I still feel bad for being critical when the author has passed away.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can definitely tell you that if you read this one, you'll want to have the next book standing by because of the lack of answers you get in this one. And yet...I can't say I'm all that thrilled to read the next book. I know what I'm likely to get from it and know that I won't find it satisfying. I'm only going to read it to get those last answers about the mystery of Griffin Powell. I'm also wary of reading it because I know there are lead-ins and focus on supporting characters that Barton had planned to write books for and it'll be disappointing to know that those characters won't get their story told because of Ms. Barton's death. But I'll read it anyway to get the last of Griffin Powell's story.\n",

      "Favorite Quote: She walked out of the study, her head held high, her shoulders straight, and her heart breaking into a million pieces.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a hard book for me to review. I have always been a huge fan of Beverly Barton. I was deeply saddened to hear she had passed away. The Griffin Powell series has been a whirlwind of suspense, intrigue, and romance starting with the first one-After Dark. Ms. Powell has never made it easy for her lovers-Griffin and Nic for example-but that made it even more thrilling. In the 12th of the Griffin Powell Agency series-Dead By Morning, we see signs that the long standing Malcolm York arc may be coming to an end. While I enjoyed this story, I have noticed in the last few books that the romance and plot hasn’t been as cohesive as the earlier ones. The surface is scratched but Barton’s trademark ability to imbibe her stories with nerve shattering tension and suspense isn’t felt here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dead By Morning focuses on Maleah Purdue and Derek Lawrence. Maleah and Derek first met in Dead By Midnight.These two have butted heads since day one. Maleah thinks that Derek is a womanizer and far too controlling for her piece of mind. Derek thinks Maleah is beautiful, intelligent, and he wants her,; but she brings out the alpha in him and he doesn’t like the possessiveness he feels towards her.\n",
      "\n",
      "A serial killer begins to target members of the Powell agency and people they hold dear to them, copying the MO of a serial killer in jail-Jerome Browning. Maleah and Derek will have to go deep into the mind of the serial killer to try and stay one step ahead. This requires Maleah to lay herself bare before Browning and match wits with him in order to secure the information they need to catch the copy cat. As our two protagonists play a dangerous game of cat and mouse; Griffin Nic, and the rest of the Powell agency are investigating along the sidelines, trying to see who or what is targeting the agency and why. We are given clues that Griffin’s arch nemesis, Malcolm York, may be back in play even though he has been thought long dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pacing of the storyline deviates; fast moving at some points then slowing down in others. I have always enjoyed her conversational writing style and found it was enhanced by different POVs which all play an integral part in the overall arc. The plot is an intriguing read, set up with multiple sub plots that build the suspense layer by layer, until we reach the conclusion of the main conflict which leaves you shocked at it’s duplicity and deception.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maleah and Derek are both interesting characters. Both are products of an abusive childhood-though each have chosen to deal with it in their own way. Maleah is guarded and controlled. She allows no one close to her and maintains a high level of independence. Derek is happy go lucky; only allowing those to see what he wants them to see. He has only superficial relationships; never committing anyone. When they meet it’s like oil and water. Derek can’t help but feel protective of Maleah while she sees his protectiveness as a way to control her. As they spend more time together, the attraction that has always been there begins to deepen into something neither of them are prepared for.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did feel that they didn’t flesh out as well as they could have. I found their bantering tedious at times and Derek annoyed me with his protectiveness. He tended to treat Maleah like a child at times. He does eventually ease up which advances their relationship. The romance is prickly and I felt the catalyst that brings them together just seemed to appear out of nowhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main arc, which adds tension and mystery through out the series, didn’t seem to advance much this go around. The secrets Griffin, Sanders, and Yvette all share are still a huge barrier standing between Nic and Griffin and I find myself as tired of them as Nic is. It’s only at the end that we are given the answer to one secret. A secret so overwhelming that may drive Nic away once and for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did enjoy getting to know Luke, Meredith, and Rafe.. These are some volatile characters who’s backgrounds will make fascinating stories\n",
      "\n",
      "Our secondary characters are a huge part of the storyline but I felt much of them were used a place markers. POVs are given which help more the plot along but they remain largely inactive, making appearances here and there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our villains are very amoral and the evil they commit makes for some uncomfortable reading. Devious and deceptive; their seeming normal appearance adds to the overall horror. As we race towards the end, you see that this is not isolated. The killings are only a small part of the game. We begin to see the intricate ties and bonds that links everything and everyone together in this story. While the main conflict is satisfied, a dramatic cliffhanger and epilogue shows us that this is only the beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over all, Dead By Morning, is a some what muted version of her previous books. While the tension and suspense is still there, it was overshadowed by a less then exciting romance. Though I honestly feel this book is a solid C, the ending is a definite B. So I am going to compromise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rating: C+\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The best part of this book was the last few pages of the last chapter and the entire epilogue. That part of the book was a solid 5 stars. The rest I give 3.5 stars. I don't mean to sound selfish & unsympathetic since Ms. Barton unexpectedly passed away, but I REALLY REALLY hope Dead by Nightfall still gets released. After the cliffhanger in this one, I'm salivating to read the that last book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her Dear Reader at the end of the book was bittersweet - she had so many plans for future books for other Powell Agency characters. Guess those will never come to light (unless someone else picks up their stories....)\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Maleah and Derek's story, it was good, but never mind blowing. The romance was weak in my opinion (Barton went to less and less romance in her books for some reason). Maleah went from hot to cold and then all of a sudden she was on fire when it came to Derek (with regard to their personal relationship) it made it a little unbelievable for me that they got to where they were at the end. The suspense part was actually anti-climatic until the very end, then my heartbeat accelerated real quick! I'm telling ya, the epilogue was awesome! In typical Barton fashion, the victims were front & center in the story and you got to know them very well. Never really bothered me much in past stories, but it bothered me in this one. Not saying why, those who read the book will figure it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "So all in all, a solid 3.5 stars. I probably would have left off the .5 if it wasn't for the very last part of the book. Like I said before, I really hope the next book still gets published so we can find out what happens.......\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I love this series of Beverly's. I was anxiously awaiting this one not only because it was Maleah and Derek's story but also because I knew the book after this would be Grif and Nic's 2nd book that finally wrapped up the whole Amara/Malcolm York arc. I was deeply saddened to hear that Beverly had passed and that was on my mind as I read this book. She was a great writer and could get inside a killers head and make the reader feel the evil that radiated off of them. I will miss her writing. I have read that she had finished the last book in the Dead by series and it will be released at the end of the year.\n",

      "Excellent collection of essays about racial justice by a slew of well-known scholars in the field. It was published in 1997 and I'm sad to say that this book hasn't aged one bit. Some of the essays are academic and can be a difficult read if you're not familiar with the field. It's not a book for beginners. But if you're at all concerned about racial justice in the United States, there are some important essays in this book. It covers a wide variety of topics, from colonialism, imperialism, government oppression by republican and democratic policies, police brutality, gender, sexual violence, feminism, economic issues including capitalism and socialism, white supremacy, and inter-community policing of others within the black community. I took my time with this book and suggest you do too. It's much easier to digest if you read one essay at a time, but it's well worth exploring.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "As a librarian I'm in a good position to notice trends in people's reading, and one hopeful sign lately is the significant increase in circulation of books about racism and anti-racism among our largely white demographic after the police killing of George Floyd and the many similar incidents that have forced their way into the media and popular consciousness as a result of the wave of protests. I don't want to exaggerate the significance either; one of the few good memes I've seen on the Internet says, \"Stop calling George Floyd a \"wake-up call\", the alarm's been ringing for four hundred years and y'all just keep hitting snooze.\" Since the civil rights movement of the fifties and sixties we have seen the battle to desegregate the Boston schools, Rodney King (the incident most referred to in this book), Ferguson, and so forth, and the media and public attention lasts just about as long as the protests. In any case, I decided to join the trend; I chose this book among those that the Library had because I've been reading Morrison's novels lately and it came up when I searched for her as an author in our catalog.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book is a collection of sixteen essays deriving from the 1994 of left-liberal Black academics held at Princeton. While the subtitle gives prominence to the three \"celebrities\", in fact the introductory essay, \"Home\" by Toni Morrison and the \"Afterword\" by Cornel West were very short and almost without any real content. The other essays took a variety of positions and were somewhat uneven (and of course had varying amounts of academic \"culture-theory\" jargon).\n",
      "\n",
      "The first essay was probably the most useful, Stephen Steinberg's \"The Liberal Retreat from Race During the Post-Civil Rights Era\", which documents the Johnson administration's -- and the \"mainstream\" liberals' -- abandonment of the Civil Rights movement after the Voting Rights Act of 1965, when Black demands shifted from formal legal equality to the question of economic equality to make practical use of the legal rights -- particularly the demand for \"affirmative action.\" He describes the strategy of shifting attention from racism and discrimination to the supposed \"pathology\" of Black culture and the Black family, which was orchestrated largely by Johnson's advisor Daniel Patrick Moynihan and his academic coauthor Nathan Glazer. (I admit to a real dislike for Moynihan and Glazer from the time I had to read their book for a class in high school -- I knew that their argument was reactionary but at that time I couldn't really explain why.) He points out how Black conservatives (e.g. William Julius Wilson) tried to give legitimacy to the Moynihan emphasis on the \"culture of poverty\" and the pathology of the Black family, shows that Wilson was a favorite of Bill Clinton, and interestingly accuses Cornel West, one of the conference organizers, of being the \"Left-wing of the Backlash\" (criticism and defense of West run through many of the articles, though not always explicitly.) This article should be required reading for those who still think the liberal Democrats were great supporters of Black civil rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall argument about the importance of genuine affirmative action and the rejection of the Black cultural pathology strategy is a leitmotif of the book. Steinberg claims that the Johnson administration missed a \"great opportunity\" to break the racial domination hierarchy, but as another author points out, genuine affirmative action was \"never on the table\" in any case. Most of the articles in the book are very critical of liberalism, but in the end they just appeal from the \"bad\" liberals to the \"good\" liberals; it is telling that the index has no entries for \"socialism\" or \"Marxism\", and the few entries for \"capitalism\" are almost all from the single article by Angela Davis.\n",
      "\n",
      "I won't discuss all sixteen articles here, but just highlight three more that were particularly interesting:\n",
      "Patricia J. Williams' \"The Ethnic Scarring of American Whiteness\" discusses the appeal of racist conservative arguments to white workers, and the way that elitist liberals play into the idea that there is a monolithic racist white working class -- \"the wholesale depiction of \"poor whites\" as bigoted, versus the enlightened, ever-so- middle and upper classes who enjoy the privilege of thinking of themselves as classless.\" Well-said!\n",
      "Two of the most disturbing articles, because they describe facts rather than just theorizing, are Robin D.J. Kelley's \"Playing for Keeps\" and Angela Davis' \"Race and Criminalization\", which document the lack of any real employment opportunity for young Black workers, with the consequent fortification of the inner cities and imprisonment of a large proportion of Black youth. Dystopian novels and films fall far short of the actual truth about American cities in the age of deindustrialization.\n",

Pese al extenso rango de fenómenos llamados nacionalismo negro, pues, podemos reconocer aún en él las dos funciones progresistas fundamentales del nacionalismo subalterno: la defensa y la unificación de la comunidad.

Though the prayers won't always apply to you on that day (though most are general enough that they do), they are still wonderful reminders of God's faithfulness and power. I'd highly recommend this book to any Christian.\n",

      "This book felt like a waste of time. I was looking for a sweet romance and an easy read. Instead, I got a boring book with no real plot. Not a smidge of romance even happened until I was 40% in (and that was them admitting that they found the other attractive...snooze). The story was all over the place, as were the characters. And the author was constantly throwing in little side stories about characters that were barely even mentioned in the rest of the book. It left me feeling bored and confused. Even the ending left me feeling like....\"that's it?\" The point in the story should have been the beginning of their \"love story\" (if you can call it that) not the ending.\n",

      "Lord Fitzroy is passionate about proving to the Tillyhenge citizens that he has their best interest at heart. They were reticent when he became Lord of Huntingdon Manor that he might introduce too many modern ideas effecting their heritage and traditions. But everyone seems thrilled with the new Tillyhenge Open-Air Cinema presented on the manicured lawn of the estate. Caitlyn Le Fey has only been a member of the community for a few months, but so much has happened during that time: discovering a long lost family, learning she is a witch, friending a guardian ‘vampire,’ and solving a few suspicious deaths. The horror spoof movie showing at tonight’s premier has made her cringe; she finds herself becoming very sensitive to the jokes and stereotypes many villagers expound on magic, witches, and vampires, but it’s just a movie. Until a curious man seemingly out of place winds up dead, puncture wounds in his throat, and her guardian ‘vampire’ Viktor Dracul, who had argued about the insult to vampires in the movie poster, pronounced himself a vampire, and was found covered in a suspicious red liquid—is arrested. Tillyhenge is becoming less quaint and relaxing and more dark and secretive. Cool!\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fourth book of H.Y. Hanna’s Bewitched by Chocolate series, we are treated to an exciting and engaging continuation of Caitlyn’s journey of self discovery, magical apprenticeship, and murder investigations along with, as we are warned, a few “Hahaha-s.” In between Hanna’s mouthwatering descriptions of Widow Mag’s delectable chocolate soufflé and other chocolate delights, the story unfolds with her signature twists and turns: an odd Goth tenant, a real British butler, friends visiting from London, a very enticing Frenchman; all have their own perspectives, suspicions, and tales to tell. This leads to an “Oh, my…” ending that makes one wanting more. I greatly enjoyed following Caitlyn’s personal growth and slow and steady magical awareness and her ‘big sister’ style attitude toward her newly discovered cousin Evie. Evie isn’t as astute at casting spells which always adds a wonderful comic relief to the dangers that keep interfering with quaint village life. Fans of the paranormal will find fascinating some of Hanna’s theories about ‘vampires.’ Viktor is a fun, centuries-old vampire taking seriously his charge to protect Caitlyn, but he isn’t your typical ‘blood-sucking’ menace. He is a ‘fruitarian’ who morphs into a fruit bat and loves ‘wild raspberries.’ I highly recommend starting at the beginning with “Dark, Witch & Creamy” and read each of the next three books in order. Although, this story has much of the characteristics of a standalone because the murder mystery concludes, there are issues that weave through the series that make it much more satisfying to read the books in order…you won’t be disappointed.\n",

      "Each book in this series is great, but they do keep getting better and better and the characters have become like friends. You just love the cantankerous but loveable Widow Mags, the novice witch, Caitiln our protagonist and her cousin, Pomona, and then there is Evie, who is trying so hard to control her magic and Caitlin's Aunt-Evies mother,.The book begins with an outdoor vampire movie on Lord Jame's estate. Where we meet a lot of new characters with James having his college buddies coming up for the weekend and the renting of two cottages on the estate property to two strange visitors. Of course, Caitlin and her cousin Pomona are just waiting for the lights to go out for the movie after meeting one of Jame's friends, who didn't even wait around for the movie to being. The lights go out and there's a shrill scream! Seems there is a murder and there are puncture wounds on the neck of the victim. Caitlin's Uncle Viktor just happened to be walking by the victim with wild raspberry juice on his face which starts a Vampire panic! Of course, no one but Caitlin's family know that Uncle Viktor is a Fruit bat, so when the old guy tries to say he is a vampire fruit bat not an old geezer, no one believes him and he becomes a suspect in the murder. While helping the Widow Mags, her grandma at the chocolate shop, Caitlin and Pomona have to investigate the murder to clear her uncle, who is driving everyone at the police station crazy trying to convince them he is a Bat! With Bran, Jame's Mastiff and the shared custody of Nibs the kitten and all the possible suspects and so many funny missteps and red-herrings and the flirting going on between James and Caitlin and so much action, you just can't put this book down! Can Cailin and Pomona clear Uncle Viktor and find the real murderer. And what does missing jewels from a jewel heist have to do with anything. And what does the phrase, \"Bats in the Belfry\" have to do with anything? I had to read this book in one sitting because It just grabs you and doesn't let go! AND the ending has a cliff hanger you have to read to see. WOW - Now I just have to get my teeth (ha ha) into the next book to see just what will happen next! I received an ARC from the author, but the opinions expressed here are stricly my own!\n",

I really like Caitlyn as a lead, and it was fun to see her experiment a bit with her magic. I have been (im)patiently waiting for her and James to finally get together, and some progress was finally made in this book! I was surprised by the ending, but I am glad that it seems this topic will be addressed sooner rather than later.\n",

His post traumatic stress from the war wears away at him as much as his overbearing, carping mother. She has demanded he turn out the now deceased gameskeeper's wife from their cottage and hire a new man. He dislikes this, but to allay further clucking from his mother he goes to speak with the widow and try to allow her a little more time.\n",

      "To say this book was hard to put down is inadequate to describe how non-stop the plot rolls as more and more is revealed. It is not overdone....just great writing here. As these two unlikely people fall in love, obstacles are at every turn.\n",

      "A heavy, believable story with well defined and developed characters. Not what I expected when I downloaded this book. This is an author to follow. A serious read. An emotional story. Recommend to readers of historical fiction and romance as well as women's fiction.\n",

Such is the author’s skill that I felt transported back to post war Britain in 1918 onwards. The characters were real, warts and all. This book will stay with me for a long time!\n",

      "I had different emotions while reading this book. The best way to describe it, it felt like I was reading two novels in one. From the beginning up to 41% I thought wow, they are going superfast and wasn’t sure how to feel. However, as the story became more interesting, I was unable to take my eyes away. All these characters started coming out of nowhere, and it was like a gangsta soap opera, so juicy. Not to say the beginning was bad, but the flow was a little different for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo, was so mysterious, and I love his take charge super alpha attitude. Belle, I enjoyed her innocence. Sometimes I thought, girl, what are you doing, run! I enjoyed their chemistry together and Leo’s infatuation with Belle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it was a little different in the way the author started and finished. I can tell you when I got to the end, I definitely felt a little sad, because all the other characters, I want to know now what happen! So excited to see if there will be more books because there is so much to be told.\n",

      "I really don’t know whether I liked this book or not, it’s one that I had to work to get into, but it kept me interested to finish it to find out how it ended. I didn’t really click with it, I don’t know why. The storyline was good, it had plenty of mystery. I think I found it hard to relate to the characters, I don’t know 🤷‍♀️. But I’m sure others out there will enjoy it. It is riddled with emotional baggage, but that only adds to the mystery. Overall, I did enjoy the read, but I just don’t know why it didn’t move me.\n",

      "This is a contemporary mafia retelling of beauty and the beast, So after Belles father is caught stealing Belle travels to the isolated Blackwood estate deep in the forest and here encounters the mysterious owner Leo Blackwood, In exchange for her father's release Belle agrees to work for Leo as his housekeeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this initially failed to grab me I found the initial interactions between Leo and Belle very fast\n",
      "and It all just seemed very cliche with very limited build-up.\n",
      "But if insta-lust and insta-love is your jam then this may not be an issue for you, I don’t mind it sometimes if it feels right but for the story here it just didn’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then found Belle to be very indecisive over just what she actually wants and that irritated me.\n",
      "She constantly puts up walls that are the polar opposite to what she says she wants but then doesn’t stick to her decisions and her thought process itself just seemed immature and juvenile.\n",
      "Leo equally irritated me he has no backbone when it comes to Belle, he could have been such a great character but comes across as so bland.\n",
      "Also some of his choices just plain confused me one being the business with Nico and Leo sending Luna in his stead, Belle was in danger and I get that Leo felt pulled in half but one was his past and the other his future would he have been able to live with himself if he’d miscalculated the situation, well it just didn’t sit well with me one little bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "That aside the second half of this was much better than the first but there was still a lot of very far fetched scenarios and I wasn’t always convinced of the authenticity of some of them.\n",
      "The writing itself was Ok but I did cringe at some of the dirty talk between Leo and Belle it was just so over the top.\n",

      "I'm a whore for fairytale retellings, especially when it's a Beauty and the Beast one so it's no suprise that I jumped at the chance to read this book. I mean, who doesn't want to read about a dominating, dark, alpha, huge hunk of a man that has a twisted side AND he belongs to the mafia? Sign me the fuck up. Yeah, unfortunately, I didn't get what I wanted. The beast was sappy. He was so whipped, he seemed weak and Belle was just plain old boring. What makes it disappointing for me is that it felt like I was just given everything to me on a plate as soon as the characters met. No. Give me angst. Give me longing. Give me the chase. Give me something interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story truly picks up after the 55% mark so you'd have to be truly patient for the mafia themes to kick in. I found one side character more alpha and interesting than the Beast and honestly, it was HIS story that kept me reading.\n",

      "Overall, I've read several retellings and this one doesn't have anything to make it stand out or make it memorable by any means.\n",

      "This is probably the first best and possibly most accurate cold war spy book, the one that launched a genre. Few authors get to invent a new category (mockumentary, etc.) but Le Carre does so here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lays out the foundation for the Karla trilogy to come.\n",

      "I don't know why it has taken me so long to decide to read this novel. I guess that, despite being a huge reader of science fiction and crime thrillers, I always thought spy stories were a bit silly. This dark and gritty drama is not that. It is tautly written and beautifully austere. In my case, it was also the perfect accompaniment to a visit to Berlin coinciding with the 25th anniversary of the fall of the wall. My appetite is now thoroughly whetted for some more le Carré.\n",

      "Fantastic book,wonderful atmosphere,great characters and a realistic and untrusting world of the spy. Great plot and twists , I know it was a good ending but I would have liked a happier one!! Fully deserves the title as best spy novel,a definite must read for the avid reader.\n",

      "I had high hopes for this book but I found it really hard to get through and not ultimately very helpful. Another reviewer noted: \"The second thing that caught my attention is how branded everything feels... She points to the work of well-known researchers — Brené Brown’s work on shame and perfectionism; Kristin Neff’s on self-compassion — and then repackages it, staples it together, and slaps a bunch of Capitalized Titles on it. I found this somewhat of a turnoff; at several points in the book I felt like I was being advertised something, or sitting in on a multi-level marketing seminar.\"\n",

      "That's exactly how I felt, like I was reading some sort of incredibly long infomercial. None of the concepts struck me as particularly novel at all, and it turns out I do most of what she preaches anyway. I had the feeling halfway through that one page might have helpful tips for me to get working on my writing again, but I was so bored by the book that I didn't bother to make notes or anything. For the most part, it just seemed like she was trying desperately to sell me something and that the whole thing could have been summed up in a blog post.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suspect that it could be quite useful for younger readers and those who are really struggling with issues of perfectionism, comparison, etc. and who are not familiar with the authors she pulled from, though. If you like diagrams and lots of back story, you're likely to enjoy it.\n",

      "I read a digital ARC of this book for review.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "2.5 stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing I noticed about The Feel Good Effect is that the physical object of the book is extremely nice. The paper is heavyweight and high quality (so much so that I think it artificially inflates the length of the book, which clocks in at just 147 pages; I read it in an evening). The font feels crisp and delicious, somehow. The whole package just feels good (sorry) in my hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second thing that caught my attention is how branded everything feels. Conley Downs, described elsewhere as “a rising star in the wellness space,” talks about how, having reached a crisis point in her personal life, she threw herself into copious amounts of research on “how the brain works, behavior change, habits, mindset, routines, goal setting, [and] mindfulness.” She points to the work of well-known researchers — Brené Brown’s work on shame and perfectionism; Kristin Neff’s on self-compassion — and then repackages it, staples it together, and slaps a bunch of Capitalized Titles on it. I found this somewhat of a turnoff; at several points in the book I felt like I was being advertised something, or sitting in on a multi-level marketing seminar. (To add to this effect, the author seeded hints to visit the book website throughout the text. In fact, you must visit this site if you want to see the book’s bibliography.)\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the general message of the book is one that aligns with my personal sensibilities regarding “wellness”, setting goals, and making needed changes; it presents “an alternative to striving” — a kind of upward spiral that is holistic, gentle, sustainable, and kind. The Feel Good Effect continues a trend that (for me) seemed to explode into the collective self-help consciousness with the rise of Marie Kondo: that of identifying and working with one’s core personal values, sometimes in unexpected areas of our lives. This shift in thinking has proven helpful to me, and I’m glad to see it encouraged here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conley Downs also has several suggestions for dealing with decision paralysis, extremist all-or-nothing thinking, self-abasement, and lack of motivation. The end of each chapter includes a few simple exercises that you can practice over time until they become automatic; I particularly like the “Third Way” practice (“Use this practice when faced with a situation in which there seems to be only two options. The trigger for this practice is if you notice yourself thinking, ‘It has to be this or that.’ For example, ‘I have to finish this entire project, or just give up on it,’ or ‘I have to give up my dreams or quit my job,’ or ‘I have to train for a marathon or stop running.’ When you notice this happening, write down the two options on a piece of paper. Ask yourself, ‘Are these really the only two options? Is there a third way?’ Challenge yourself to write down as many alternative options as you can”) and the “Goal Flip” exercise, wherein you practice reverse-engineering a results-oriented goal to transform it to one that is process-oriented.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not like that the principles in this book are described as “a program” and I do not like that the author also encourages some “accountability” practices (such as “team[ing] up with a friend, family member, or coworker to do the challenge together, increasing your accountability”) — both of those words, to me, scream “strive some more” — but I don’t think the ideas themselves are bad. Example: although I am allergic to “accountability partners” for grew-up-in-a-cult reasons, I also currently have an agreement with a friend to ask each other about our NaNoWriMo progress each day this month. I think that planning to try something new with a friend and periodically checking in to see how it’s going can be fun and effective; I just prefer to leave the word “accountability” out of it, as it seems to add a layer of moral weight to whatever we’re doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, I’m not convinced The Feel Good Effect contains a new system. It is a decent, if somewhat fluffy, introduction to some solid self-care practices that synthesizes some very useful research. I think it’s worth a read for anyone feeling exhausted by the endless, often contradictory “wellness” options available these days, or for anyone interested in thinking about health and happiness through the lenses of systems theory and personal values. While I don’t know if this book will become a permanent part of my personal library, I would like to experiment over time with some of the exercises I’m not already doing, so I’m going to hang onto my copy for now as a reference.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I’m a longtime listener of Robyn’s podcast and this book was EVERYTHING I hoped it would be (and then some)! Robyn knits together so many concepts, science-backed studies, behavior shifts, mindset shifts, and strategies into one radically actionable book.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, it’s one of those books that meets you right where you’re at AND…also feels like one I know I’ll be revisiting & pulling on and off my shelf for years to come. Fittingly, there’s a really thoughtfully curated index at the end of the book where you can jump straight to topics like “perfectionism”, “toxic comparison”, or “decision templates” – and get the support you need, when you need it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got my hands on it, I thought I knew what to expect going in. And while I was so delighted to see the same compassionate & science-driven approach that I’ve come to expect from her Feel Good Effect podcast – there was so much more hiding in these pages. Like exercises, gorgeous visuals, and helpful frameworks to wrap your mind around how these frameworks fit into your real life. I devoured chapter after chapter, flying through the book in just a few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s the real kicker - I’m one of those people who reads a lot of self-help and wellness books. And – to be honest - also the sort of person who tends to skip the actionable exercises in them. Robyn’s “Make it Happen” exercises at the end of each chapter were my favorite part. They’re so different than anything else I’ve read, and I actually did them. ALL of them. They’re super simple, approachable, realistic, and in a word - transformative. I could do them quickly as I read, without feeling interrupted. And they didn’t feel like they were just fluffy exercises either, I could see new habits trickle into my day just a few chapters in. Ones I had been trying to integrate for years just started sticking in my routine again.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short –I’m not even sure if I can capture the magic that is this book in this review but I feel like everyone needs a voice like Robyn in their life. If only approaches like hers were more common in the wellness world. I haven’t felt this seen or supported by a book in a long time, and I’m just left feeling super grateful after wrapping up the last page.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is the book I have been waiting for - a self-help book based on science with actionable steps - and I loved it.\n",
      "I have been following Robyn's blog and listening to her podcast for a number of years and have enjoyed watching the evolution of her strength and messages. I am also a scientist and I really appreciated the tone of her writing and her detailed explanations. I struggle with a lot of the topics in this book, especially the \"all or nothing thinking\" and I can't wait to get started with some of her strategies. I highly recommend this book!\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "My main takeaway from this book is the author's explanation of how the striving mindset - one's tendency towards perfectionism, all-or-nothing thinking, and toxic comparison - is a habit of the mind that can prevent you from making sustainable changes, reaching your goals, and ultimately being healthy and happy. The good news is that by making tiny mindset shifts, you can replace this counter-productive way of thinking with Conley Downs' \"feel good mindset,\" which includes the practice of self-compassion, the power middle, and gratitude. Her perspective and ideas have been extremely helpful to me. For instance, when I notice myself slipping into that familiar striving mindset, where I beat myself on the head for missing a workout or not achieving a specific goal, I remind myself to practice self-kindness and remain flexible in my thinking. With this in mind, I'm more likely to stick to my goals and resume where I left off than I am to give up altogether. The beauty and power of this approach is that you can always find your own personal happy middle ground simply by changing the way you think; and therein lies the key to being healthy and happy. I get to define wellness on my own terms rather than trying to live up to some perceived objective ideal. I definitely recommend and will be gifting it to my girlfriends!\n",

      "==============\n",
      "Wow. I'm inspired and challenged by this book and by Christopher Yuan's example of godly obedience in his own personal life. Yuan successfully demonstrates that holy sexuality is not gay vs straight but rather faithful obedience to God's design for both singleness and marriage. That is my very over-simplistic summary, as he discusses identity, discipleship, and more. It's rich with content and wisdom, both in theology and practical application.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you find yourself confused on the topic of sexuality and/or identity, have a family member struggling with same sex attraction, or just want to know how better to love and support your neighbor (single and married), this is a fantastic resource. Although, the audience that could benefit is much wider than these few I've mentioned. I highly recommend!\n",
      "\n",
      "P.S. His mom is my new hero.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I understand why Yuan’s work is popular. First, he’s a nice guy and is a great speaker with a compelling story, the kind that Christians love to hear—the classic bad boy, really bad boy, to preacher story. It also titillates us and makes us feel good listening to theology that agrees with what we’ve been told about the dark and evil located outside of us, in the stuff we would never do.\n",
      "Because it is likely that the majority of potential readers of “Holy Sexuality” will be pastors, youth leaders, families, and friends of LGBTQ people (both Christian and not), I’m writing this review for you. I’m a straight evangelical Christian, mother of two adult straight children, faithful follower of Jesus, active in my evangelical church, author of a book on the history of the cultural and religious discrimination against LGBTQ community, and speaker on the topic.\n",
      "With this review, I hope to push readers beyond what might be comfortable. Often we aren’t interested in digging around in difficult topics until an issue becomes personal in some way. Only then you may see what is glaringly obvious to ever increasing numbers of us Christians—that there are millions of LGBTQ single and married Christians faithfully following and serving God. And books like “Holy Sexuality,” ignores them, and does great injustice and harm to them.\n",
      "I hope you’ll also begin to wonder why conservative leaders continually create a turn stile of methods, nuanced language, and shifting theology to “deal” with homosexuality.\n",
      "Since his last book, Yuan has significantly ramped up his negative messaging about homosexuality. His words carry weight and go a distance (he speaks publicly several hundred times each year). The impact from this book will be elevated levels of damage to LGBTQ people and their families, a continuation of misinformation about sexual orientation, and driving of people (not just LGBTQ people, but those who support their full inclusion in churches) from Christian churches.\n",
      "In “Holy Sexuality,” Yuan creates freshly nuanced language and reshaped questionable theology. His ideas might indeed seem “holy.” So, let me lay them out a bit more clearly.\n",
      "First, I need to step back here a bit to lay some historical groundwork.\n",
      "Christian theology about sexuality in general, and with respect to gay people in particular, is quite a new concept. Christians had widely avoided discussing sexuality at all until the 1970s. And there was certainly no theology about homosexuality coming from the conservative church during that time.\n",
      "Further, did you realize the first usage of the word “homosexual” in the Bible was in the Revised Standard Version in 1946 where it appeared in 1 Cor. 6: 9-10? Before the RSV was published, throughout history that Corinthians text had been interpreted and understood as a situation in which a socially more powerful and/or older man imposed exploitative, abusive penetrative sex on a boy, or on a subservient person.\n",
      "During the RSV translation process of Corinthians in the 1930s and early 1940s, the team decided to join two Greek words—malakoi and arsenokoitai—into one word “homosexual” for ease in understanding. The team had been tasked to update the language of the popular King James, the ASV, and the ESV to more modern English. For the most part, until then, the two Greek words had been a variation on “effeminate” (one who takes the sexual penetrated role of a woman) and “sodomite” (one who penetrates another person, typically with excessive lust and with no intent to procreate). Even in the 1930s, the word “homosexual” carried a different meaning and implication than it does today. Then, homosexuality was wrongly considered a mental illness; not a moral issue, but a pathological one.\n",
      "It’s even more obvious that the word homosexual as we understand it today (one who is emotionally, romantically, and sexually attracted to the same sex) is a poor conjoining and translation of two words that throughout history had referred to exploitative sex.\n",
      "The placement of the word “homosexual” in Corinthians went relatively unnoticed for the next 30 years. Historical denominational journals, pastoral counseling magazines, and Christian books reflect this. There was simply no discussion taking place that connected morality and sin to homosexuality using 1 Corinthians. (This is all part of the historical work I am now doing.)\n",
      "Then in the 1971 The Living Bible paraphrase, the words “homosexual/homosexuality” were introduced in six more places in the Bible for the first time (Leviticus twice, Deuteronomy, 1 Kings, Romans (inferred) and 1 Timothy). Surprising, isn’t it? Still, there was no theology created around homosexuality. The Christian church was not in the fix-the-gays business. The translation notes on this Bible indicate the translations, just as had happened in the RSV, were cultural decisions, not theological ones.\n",
      "About the same time, in 1973, medical experts lifted the designation of mental illness off homosexuality. They had never had the science or studies to support the pathological designation. The history of understanding the progression of human sexuality from 1870 till 1970 is fascinating! For another time . . .\n",
      "Sadly, in the late 1970s, a landscape created primarily by the Moral Majority and conservative politics developed in America that made it politically advantageous for conservatives and financially advantageous for TV evangelists at the time to blame moral decline in the country and church on a few select topics: abortion (did you know the SBC supported abortion in the early 1970s? Pretty surprising, right?), drugs, and “the gays.”\n",
      "Still, historical documents show that absolutely no “gay theology” had yet been constructed.\n",
      "By the end of the 1970s, however, the first Christian groups began to slowly appear with a mission to “fix” the gays and make them straight by employing reparative therapy, and even suggesting that gay people enter into heterosexual marriages. Even though the word “homosexual” was placed in the RSV and the TLB with no theological considerations, and little medical understanding, still, it was conveniently there.\n",
      "Previously discarded theories as to why some people were gay were recycled, re-tooled slightly, and wrapped in Christianese. Voila! A new Christian industry was born and along with it, a slowly emerging theology informing Christians about “what God clearly says about homosexuality.”\n",
      "Over the next generation, Christian ministries tried to make gay people straight by: encouraging them to find the root of the problem in their relationship to their smother-mother or distant father, repenting for an imagined outright rebellion against God, memorizing and employing key verses on temptation, avoiding contact with other gay people, modifying their behaviors to be more masculine for gay men and more feminine for lesbians, and even marrying opposite sex partners as a sign of faith that God would change their attraction with this step of obedience.\n",
      "All that foolishness didn’t work and tragically caused massive amounts of shame, depression, substance abuse issue, promiscuity, suicide, and broken families and marriages for LGBTQ people.\n",
      "So, now what’s next if we can’t make gay people straight and stop them from being gay?\n",
      "Here was an opportune pivot point for the conservative church. Instead, they honed in on the next iteration of a more refined theology. This is the most common currently, and it focuses on imposed celibacy for LGBTQ people.\n",
      "Even in this celibacy-for-gay camp, there is a variety of beliefs around how LGBTQ people are “allowed” to identify—either as a “gay Christian” or a “same-sex attracted Christian.” And, still, identification as a same-sex attracted celibate Christian does not seem restrictive enough personally for Christopher Yuan, so he has created another level of more nuanced language and has reshaped theology about homosexuality, celibacy, and even marriage.\n",
      "Here is what I suspect may be at play. And no, I do not have a degree in psychology, but recall, I have thousands, yes, really, of LGBTQ friends and acquaintances whom I have listened to closely and observed for about twenty years, with almost fifteen of those years within LGBTQ Christian environments. I have hundreds of friends who have gone the Christian reparative therapy route. I have multiple dozens of friends who have been leaders, authors, therapists, and speakers in the ex-gay/celibacy movements.\n",
      "The theology and rules set that Yuan has had a part in creating, teaching, and living by are no longer working for him. He admits that he is still sexually tempted (p. 126) and writes: “As a policy, I never travel alone, and I'm blessed my mother has committed to travel with me wherever I go as my prayer warrior and someone to hold me accountable when I am on the road.” (p. 73) Adding, “One of the things lacking today is a robust theological discussion on sexual orientation.” (p. 67)\n",
      "What? The 40 or so books on the topic I have personally read and reviewed with at least an equal number above that which I have read are not enough?\n",
      "Maybe it is not enough, because they don’t work.\n",
      "Yuan built his new theology with a few foundational beliefs:\n",
      "“One cannot properly understand human sexuality unless it is rooted in “theological anthropology”(p. 12); and, we must believe in the fall of Adam and Eve leading to the doctrine of original sin or we reject the work of Christ on the cross” (p.26)... all concluding: “When it comes to sexuality, the place to start must always be the image of God and the doctrine of sin. No Christian should ever challenge these fundamental principles. (p. 33)\n",
      "To be a “real” Christian, it seems, we are forced to choose between two alternatives -- either choose faith and literal reading of the Bible in intellectual exile, or be intellectually curious and honest and abandon your faith. I choose the middle ground. Incorporating Scripture and science does not diminish my respect for and submission to God’s authority.\n",
      "I don’t use the Bible as a science book, or as a template dictating the limited heteronormative binary of human sexuality, and still, I am a Christian, one who refuses to abuse Scripture and use unsubstantiated interpretations created by others to marginalize groups of people that are not like me.\n",
      "So when Yuan constructs yet another new variation of “robust theological discussion on sexual orientation,” I strongly object.\n",
      "As with prior conservative variations, in creating his new modification, Yuan ignores what medical and psychological professionals universally agree upon—that homosexuality is a natural variation of human sexuality. For Yuan, “same-sex sexual practice or any struggle with sin such as resisting same-sex sexual desire has only one root cause: original sin.” Adding, “To claim the primary root of homosexuality is anything but original sin is to deny orthodoxy.” (p. 37) Again, I don’t imagine I am going to fall off into a heretical abyss if I side with medical experts on this one.\n",
      "Yuan vehemently rejects the connection between his theology and harm suffered by LGBTQ people stating there is no empirical evidence. (p. 152) Not only is there statistical evidence, it is highly disturbing that Yuan needs to see numbers to “prove” the damage caused by his strain of theology. Evidence shows LGBTQ kids who are rejected by their families are 8.4 times more likely to attempt suicide than LGBTQ kids who are supported by their families. Reading one Brene Brown book on shame should be enough to rethink this destructive theology.\n",
      "Setting studies aside, Yuan could simply invest time in listening and learning directly from LGBTQ Christians and their families. That could be emotionally risky though for a man who has build his own high walls of protection. Yuan controls the questions asked of him in public settings. (For a particularly raw view into this and other dynamics going on in Yuan’s life, consider watching “Yuan Speaks at Yale Part 2” on YouTube starting at the 5:30 mark.)\n",
      "With homosexuality rooted in original sin, what’s a gay Christian to do? As indicated, above, in the past, it was suggested that they submit to some form of therapy to become ex-gay, or maybe remain celibate for life. And here another switch-up—no, says Yuan, those are not viable options. (p. 39) Wait, what about all those other books by conservative Christians who say this is the most acceptable option? What happened to that and what God clearly told them?\n",
      "“I believe both these paths (the ex-gays and celibate gays) fall short in the same way, by elevating sexual orientation as a redeemable category.” (p. 39) “With same-sex attractions, the problem is sin, and the gospel is the answer.” (p. 40) “The terms heterosexual and homosexual originate from a secular anthropology that elevates sexual desires as a legitimate way to categorize humanity.” (p. 46) “Using a term that confuses our true identity is unwise, and embracing such a broad category that includes sinful behavior should be roundly rejected.” (p. 47)\n",
      "I found the following sentences to be quite stunning: “Segregating ourselves into straight Christians and gay Christians gives the false impression that we’re fundamentally different at the core of our being. We need more unity not less, and this segregation by orientation is in essence a form of affective apartheid.” (p. 72) Affective apartheid?\n",
      "Did you catch all that? If being gay is sin, and calling oneself gay is sin, and even sexual orientation terms for heterosexual and homosexual are secular, and inherently elevate sexual sin, what solution does Yuan suggest to rise above all this linguistic gymnastics?\n",
      "Glad you asked, “what other options do we have, you may ask other than heterosexuality and homosexuality? What we need is a completely new paradigm to represent God's sexual ethic. Holy sexuality.” (p. 47) This term has been tossed around for about a decade usually in this form: what is the opposite of homosexuality? Not heterosexuality, but holisexuality.\n",
      "Yuan wants to jettison the sexual orientation terms, all of them, in the church: “We pigeonholed ourselves into the wrong framework for biblical sexual expression: heterosexuality, bisexuality, or homosexuality. It's time to break free from this paradigm and embrace God's vision for sexuality. Holy sexuality consists of two paths: chastity in singleness and faithfulness in marriage.” (p. 47)\n",
      "What follows is an odd discourse on the elevation and idolization of marriage in the U.S. addressing the Obergefell v Hodges same-sex marriage decision.. “Not only did it (the decision) redefine marriage, but it also legally ratified the falsity that marriage is the pinnacle of love.”(p. 77) Yuan then adds, “I respectfully, but resolutely, disagree. Marriage may be an expression of love, but it's not the highest ideal of love. God is. Let me further elucidate how Justice Kennedy's assertions are found lacking when measured against biblical truth. Marriage may be an expression of fidelity, but it's not the highest ideal of fidelity. God is.” (p. 77) Yuan in contrast to the Supreme Court, states “marriage is not a basic human or civil right.” (p. 92)\n",
      "Now, what should the church do with all these celibates who struggle with loneliness? I’ve read this solution several times in many other gay celibate books, and each time I find it overly altruistic. Yuan suggests that Christian families should include single people of the church in their own families in order to create a family for them. Yuan then asks “Will you commit to making this a reality for the sake of me and all Christian singles? (p. 137) As I mentioned, quite altruistic, and where is the biblical model for couples taking in the church celibate? My goodness, many of us struggle to love the stranger and the immigrant well, and that is in the Bible.\n",
      "I know there are bisexual people who have attractions along the spectrum from straight to gay. Some people with some level of same-sex attraction can successfully marry heterosexually. Yuan takes the possibilities a bit further: “Many assume that lifelong celibacy is the only option for believers with same-sex attraction. While we shouldn't promote biblical marriage as the ultimate prize as ex-gay ministries have done in the past, we also shouldn't discount the possibility that God can do the impossible. Mandating lifelong celibacy for those with same-sex attraction on the false premise that physical marriage is impossible for them does not permit God to be God, the only one who determines the future.” (p. 116)\n",
      "Yuan does engage pro-gay theology, and in particular Matthew Vines, founder of The Reformation Project. In the spirit of transparency, I have known Matthew since 2013, before the formation of The Reformation Project. I’ve been on the board of the organization for 6 years, and am now the chair of the board. Matthew is one of my closest friends. So, when Yuan writes about him and makes assumptions as to his character and beliefs, it is quite easy for me to see through it.\n",
      "Yuan writes: “To conclude that bad fruit refers to suicide, attempted suicide, or even suicidal ideation requires a biblical interpreter to abandon basic exegetical principles. Furthermore, for Vines, hardship and distress are utterly incompatible with his idea of Christian life. Matthew’s irresponsible methodology is essentially a dance with deception.” (p. 149) Adding, “Matthew Vines simply represents a new iteration of the health, wealth, and prosperity movement,” (p. 150) and “Vines’ interpretation leaves no room for suffering and cross bearing in the life of the believer. (p. 149) None of what Yuan writes is an accurate reflection of what Matthew has publicly expressed, or how he lives his life. Yuan has embellished and distorted Matthew’s stances.\n",
      "Matthew writes in “God and the Gay Christian”: “Much of our culture does promote the idea that our greatest fulfilment is to be found in sex and marriage. To the extent that Christians accept that view, we risk idolizing romantic love and losing sight of our first love, Christ. It is true, too, that God does not promise us easy lives. We are called to deny ourselves, to take up our crosses, and to follow Jesus.”\n",
      "Yuan concludes, “If a leader blatantly takes Scripture out of context like this, twisting the Bible to say what it doesn't say, everything else he teaches should be suspect.” (p. 155) On this Yuan and I agree. When a leader twists Scripture, takes it out of context and lies, he/she is not to be trusted. I do not trust Christopher Yuan.\n",
      "On page 33, Yuan quotes a Chinese proverb: “A millimeter discrepancy leads to a thousand mile loss. If the point of departure is a bit off from the start, the deviation in the end can be overwhelmingly large.”\n",
      "The theology in “Holy Sexuality” is off, by a thousand miles. While Yuan wants increasingly “robust” sexual orientation theology, I think we need to go back to the point of departure and reexamine the wrong assumptions. We need to listen to both the experts on sexual orientation and to LGBTQ Christians themselves. It is abundantly clear that all the fix-the-gays variations have not and are not working and do create damage.\n",
      "Yet, Yuan builds the walls tighter unto himself to control a natural part of him, and the conservative church applauds him, puts him on hundreds of stages, and peddles his theology as “God’s truth.”\n",
      "Take your eyes off the stage. Look at the ones to the sides. They are really the greater story. Despite all the barriers built against them, and the damage done to them, many of them have been there loving, serving, and worshipping God. They are the LGBTQ Christian community—single, dating, married, celibate—and they are speaking. Listen to them.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "In 2011, Christopher Yuan opened up and shared his personal testimony in Out of a Far Country: A Gay Son’s Journey to God, a Broken Mother’s Search for Hope (co-authored with his mother, Angela Yuan). In Holy Sexuality and the Gospel, he follows up his testimony with a book that deals more broadly with “sex, desire, and relationships shaped by God’s grand story” (tagline on the cover). The book could be viewed as a biblical theology of sexuality with particular reference to those who struggle with same-sex attraction, as well as those who love them. Yuan does not spend much time tackling the verses in the OT and the NT traditionally understood as condemning same-sex practice—he leaves that to others, citing the work of Robert Gagnon () and Kevin DeYoung (). His focus is more on understanding sexuality in terms of the big picture of the biblical narrative of creation, fall, redemption, and consummation. I found the book to be clear, theologically sound, and pastorally encouraging.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Foreword, Rosaria Butterfield gives a ringing endorsement. Not one to pull her punches, she argues that “the idol of our historical epoch is this: your sexual desires define you, determine you, and should always delight you” (p. xiv). She praises Yuan’s book as a tearing down of the idol of our day, showing how it is on a collision course with the gospel.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Chs. 1-3, Yuan frames the discussion in light of creation in the image of God. In Chs. 4-5, he deals with the fall and our fallen sin nature that is the root of all sexual sin. In Ch. 6, “Holy Sexuality,” he sets out the main thesis of the book and defines the key phrase that is part of the title of the book. In Chs. 7-9, he addresses the related issues of desire, temptation, and sexual orientation. With regard to the latter, sexual orientation, he rejects it as a modern construct owing more to Freud than to the Bible. In Chs. 10-11, he offers a wonderful biblical theology of marriage. In Chs. 12-14, he addresses the topic of singleness and the need for the church to be the family of God in which we are all brothers and sisters in Christ. In Chs. 15-16, he deals with the doctrine of sanctification. In Chs. 17-20, he wraps up with pastoral guidance on how to have these difficult conversations with the LGBT community, and the need for discipleship for those converted from that community and brought into the church. The book has a study guide at the end with a list of questions for use in small group discussions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going back to Ch. 6, what is “Holy Sexuality”? I can’t do better than to quote Yuan himself. He explains this key concept, which is also part of the book title:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very helpful reframing of the issue: instead of framing it in terms of sexual orientation (homosexual vs. heterosexual), Yuan frames it in terms of holiness (either faithfulness in marriage or chastity in singleness). This reframing avoids two problems. It avoids the problematic claim that those who struggle with same-sex attraction must undergo ex-gay conversion therapy in order to be changed from homosexuals into heterosexuals. It also avoids the claim that those who struggle with same-sex attraction ought to adopt a gender identity of being “homosexual” or “gay” and then choose celibacy, a life-long commitment to being an unmarried gay person. Yuan argues that chastity in singleness (for as long as God is calling you to be single) is the better approach. Who knows? God may call the same-sex attracted person to be married to someone of the opposite sex, and then he is calling them to holy sexuality in the form of faithfulness in marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been accustomed to say that same-sex attracted Christians are called to celibacy, but Yuan has convinced me that is not quite right. The focus on holy sexuality is on holiness in one’s sexual life, not on the patterns of one’s sexual attractions, whether changing them or acquiescing to them. The call of God to the same-sex attracted Christian is no different than the call of God to all Christians. All of us, whether single or married, are called to the same standard: sexual holiness. This is such an encouraging and liberating approach that cuts through the confusion around orientation and gender identity and issues a clarion call to all Christians to submit our sexuality to the Lordship of Christ.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also appreciated Yuan’s theological acumen in Chs. 7-8, where he does a careful anatomy of temptation and desire, and the whole the fraught question of the moral status of same-sex attraction. Among those who agree that same-sex relationships are not morally permissible for Christians, there seem to be two main views of the moral status of same-sex attraction. I am simplifying here. Within each camp, individual thinkers have different nuances, terms and definitions, but broadly speaking the two main camps are: (1) the view that sexual orientation is not ontologically real but a late 19th century innovation; that there are only sexual desires and sexual temptations; and that same-sex desire is sinful and must be mortified (Denny Burk, Heath Lambert, Owen Strachan, Sam Allberry, Rosaria Butterfield); and (2) the view that sexual orientation is a real category; that the homosexual orientation is a result of the fall, and is sinful if acted on; but that being gay itself—as a gender identity, not as a sexual practice—is sanctifiable (Wesley Hill, Nate Collins, Mark Yarhouse, Ron Belgau). The former camp tends to use the term “Christians who struggle with same-sex attraction or SSA,” whereas the second camp is comfortable speaking of “celibate gay Christians.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yuan falls in the first camp and is critical of the second. In Ch. 7, he deals with same-sex temptations, and argues that it is not sinful to struggle with and be tempted by this sin. He appeals to the fact that Jesus was tempted and was nevertheless without sin (Heb 4:15). In fact, Yuan argues, Jesus was “the ultimate example of struggling,” yet without ever succumbing to sin. “The Christian life doesn’t mean you won’t be tempted; it means you’ll have the Spirit-wrought ability to be holy even in the midst of temptations. What matters most is not that we are tempted but how we respond to temptation” (pp. 56-57). He quotes John Owen: “It is impossible that we should be so freed from temptation as not to be at all tempted” (, ed. Kelly Kapic and Justin Taylor [Crossway, 2006], 159). So same-sex temptations are not sinful.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what about same-sex desires? That is a different question and Yuan addresses it in Ch. 8. He takes a teleological approach to desire and argues that “the moral value of any desire is determined by whether its ‘end’ transgresses or conforms to God’s standard” (p. 61). Every desire has a telos—an end, intended goal, or aim. In order to know whether any given desire is good or evil, we have to examine its telos. Yuan appeals to the teaching of Jesus, who taught his disciples to consider the telos of sexual desire:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The implication is that not all admiring of a woman’s physical beauty is sinful—if not done with lustful intent. Not even all looking at a woman with sexual desire is sinful—if it is the woman’s husband doing the looking (here Yuan quotes the Song of Solomon; p. 62). In the husband’s case, the telos is good and therefore the desire is good and holy. But applying this teleological analysis to same-sex desire yields a different moral calculus: “The end of same-sex sexual desire is sexual intimacy between two men or two women—which is sinful behavior. If the end is wrong, then the desire is wrong. Thus, same-sex sexual desire is sinful” (p. 63). But what about same-sex nonsexual romantic desire? Such desires would be sinful, because they are a desire to be united in a one-flesh union with someone of the same-sex. “While lacking eroticism, when these romantic affections are toward a person in which a biblical covenantal union cannot occur, they are still wrong” (p. 64). To sum up:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I love that line: “Every single desire we have must be put to the test. What is its end?” Yuan’s teleological moral analysis of desire is thoroughly biblical and stunningly simple. It cuts like a hot knife through the butter of all the confusion, perplexity, and controversy that has somehow gunked up evangelical thinking on this issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is much more that I can’t summarize here. Suffice it to say, Yuan has written a spiritually sensitive, biblically sound, Christ-honoring book on a highly relevant topic. I highly recommend it to all Christians, especially those who struggle with SSA or who love someone who does.\n",

      "My former FCA Director would always refer to his wife as a donut.. because in his words she was, “hot and holy”. This doesn’t really relate to the book, but I have ADD so you can understand.\n",

      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Years ago I met Dr. Christopher Yuan for the first time. I was at a denominational convention where he and his mother had a booth set up to promote their ministry and book Out of a Far Country: A Gay Son's Journey to God. At the time, I was intrigued by the brief introduction to them and their story. Little did I know that my wife and I would be experiencing similar circumstances when our son expressed to us that he identified as gay. It was during this time I contacted Christopher and invited him to speak at our church. All in our family were encouraged by his message of hope. Christopher shared his personal story along with his parents during our morning worship service. That evening he led two seminars related to Christianity, the church, and LGBTQ+ individuals. It was during his presentations that I first heard Christopher use the term \"holy sexuality.\" He used the term in his first book as well. This term is more than just another evangelical buzzword. As Rosaria Butterfield has said, this term is \"a concept that changed the paradigm of what it means to live out God's best for us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just a few weeks ago, I received an advanced readers copy (ARC) of Christopher's newly released book Holy Sexuality and the Gospel: Sex, Desire, and Relationships Shaped by God's Grand Story. I began reading and found myself highlighting phrases and paragraphs on almost every page. Dr. Yuan unpacks so much related to sexuality. While he addresses LGBTQ+ identifiers, his book is not focused solely on these. Sexual sin, whether homosexual or heterosexual is sin. Yuan states...\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We cannot properly understand human sexuality unless we begin with theological anthropology. Anthropology, in general terms, is the study of humanity. Essentially, it's the human search to answer the important question Who am I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All our thoughts an actions are influenced at some level by how we answer the question Why am I? This suggests a closer relationship between essence and ethics than many realize. The two inform each other. Who we are (essence) determines how we live (ethics), and how we live determines who we are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Yuan's solid emphasis on the gospel and identity as bestowed by God presents a firm foundation for the book. As an HIV+ man who had for years lived sexually promiscuous as a gay man, was a self-described partier and drug user, and eventually went to prison for dealing drugs, Yuan does not speak as one who views sin as superficial or overly-simplified. He writes and speaks as one who has been in the pit, experienced an undeserved rescue, and continues to live amazed at the grace and mercy offered from God. The main character in Dr. Yuan's story is not himself, but God.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some have declared Yuan's perspective on anthropology or ontology to be flawed. I have read declarations that he misuses data and scientific proof. Others who identify as LGBTQ+ see Dr. Yuan as a sell-out or a betrayer. The negative reviews of his books mostly feign to be intellectual analyses, but often reveal a personal vitriol against Dr. Yuan based on his current message and lifestyle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, for those who have actually read Yuan's writings (not just the two books here, but also his second book Giving a Voice to the Voiceless: A Qualitative Study of Reducing Marginalization of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Same-Sex Attracted Students at Christian Colleges and Universities) or heard him speak, it is clear that Dr. Yuan is not playing fast and loose with science, research, or historical aspects of biblical Christianity and sexual ethics. His revealed research and intelligent insight debunks any theory that he simply bases his beliefs on conservative, biblical talking points or Twitter-size hot-button phrasing. Does Dr. Yuan have a personal agenda? Absolutely. Every author does. Every Christian does. Dr. Yuan's agenda is not to harm others at all. His agenda is revealed in his writings clearly. It is simply to declare the message of the gospel well, unapologetically, without compromise, and fully in love.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a practical level, Dr. Yuan's latest book on holy sexuality should be read by any evangelical pastor seeking to minister well to those in the church or community desiring to better understand their LGBTQ+ friends and relatives without abandoning biblical fidelity. He addresses the reality of loving without affirming. For those who do not believe their friends or church families are impacted by this reality of culture, it is time to wake up. Many pastors would rather just not address these issues. Some who have done so end up doing more harm than good, that is certain. For pastors seeking to ignore the very real questions being asked by those self-identifying as gender fluid or any one of the many letters being expressed by the common LGBTQ+ identifier (or their loved ones) the fact is clear - you cannot remain silent. Your silence speaks loudly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Yuan's book is not only informational related to the biblical understanding of sexuality, but relatable, insightful, and practical. The included study guide provides real-life questions that can be addressed in small group studies. These all point to biblical answers and are firmly rooted in the gospel and a biblical worldview.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with Rosaria Butterfield who stated in her review that this book is the \"most important humanly composed book about biblical sexuality and godly living for our times.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I encourage every Christian with a loved one identifying as LGBTQ+ to read this book. I encourage every single adult Christian (heterosexual or same-sex attracted) to read this book to better understand the very real concept of holy singleness and holy sexuality. In addition to Dr. Yuan's clear and correct take on holy sexuality, his focus on the value and role of those whom God has called to singleness within the body of Christ is powerful and needed. He addresses head-on the idolatry that has overtaken some within the Christian church regarding the false elevation of marriage as essential for spiritual maturity.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's more to unpack here, but for sake of space, I will end with \"Read this book! It is needed and valuable.\"\n",

      "Aphra Connolly’s life can never be normal again, not since she discovered the true nature of her mother’s work and unwittingly landed herself on the hit list of a very dangerous man known as The Mold. So, she and her mom have been flying under the radar and hiding out in France, but despite their careful precautions, they are still not safe. When they discover they’re being followed, they’re on the run once more, but they don’t get very far once Aphra’s mother’s Parisian contact is found drowned in the Seine. And just like that, Aphra finds herself a pawn in the midst of another deadly plot involving The Mole and the boy of her dreams, Seth Mulo. But this girl isn’t just another pawn in this sick game; she’s a player, sick and tired of being threatened. And she’s not leaving without a fight.\n",

      "Gerber does not disappoint with this exciting novel from her Death by… series. Gerber’s strength is by far in creating such a thrilling and fast paced plot that will keep readers on the edge of their seats. There are even the spies, sleeper cells, and dangerous thugs, everyone with mixed up identities, to keep thigs fresh, interesting, and unpredictable. While I appreciate Aphra’s quick thinking and resourcefulness, I also feel the character development could’ve been better. The reader barely gets to know certain characters because the story moves along so quickly. But despite that, Death by Denim is a wholly enjoyable read, full of action, romance, and international flair. Action packed and suspenseful, Death by Denim wraps Gerber’s Death by… series into a trilogy while still leaving room for an offshoot continuation.\n",

Well, that's because it is. This book is only like 230 pages and I felt like so much more could have been said, emphasized, etcetera! I just wish it was a longer story with more romance.

      "I almost DNFed this twice. I only kept reading to see if they found the sister and to see the h's stupid reaction when she was proven wrong about being the Alara. I couldn't stand Ada the h. She was a TSTL stubborn biotch. She was infuriating. If I was the H, I would have shipped her ass back to Earth....good riddance. Then the only other rescued human female that was more annoying than Ada, Jaya, seems is gonna have her own book. Yeah, no thanks! I'll pass!! 👎\n",

      "So I wound up really loving this one... I thought I was going to give it 4 stars, but by the time I reached the final chapter and then the Epilogue, I knew this was gonna be a 5 star read for me. In spite of my reaction to one very TSTL move our heroine makes here, She was able to redeem herself.. Kinda. But I won't spoil it...\n",

      "This is a new series it seems. The 2nd book will not be out until March 2022. But I loved this intro to this series so much, I will be returning to see what is in store for all of Lothan's brothers. I am more curious about the youngest one, Lyro, but book 2 will be about Thren, the brute. He was interesting too. Hope his book lives up to the mystery of him. The other brother Nik, The assassin, VERY intrigued with him too. But I think Lothan has like 6 brothers or something. The whole series is said to cover them all.\n",

      "Lothan is the oldest of six brothers and ruler of his kingdom since his father departed. When he scents his mate, he knows he must have her as his queen and rule by his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ada is only interested in rescuing her sister and makes a bargain with Lothan. Help save her sister and she will consider being by his side. If I were Lothan I think I would have said see ya...you aren't worth it!\n",

      "\n",
      "Ada...I hated her. She was too stubborn and honestly just an ungrateful asshole. She was a coward and acted like a chicken with her head cut off 98% of the time. Bok bok b*tch. Lothan is the only reason I'm rating this book this high.\n",

      "Ada and a group of other females have been abducted from Earth and transported to another Galaxy. Now she and her sister Lena are going to attempt a breakout before they get sold off into slavery by the Frathiks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their plans go a bit awry when some of the girls get split up and sold off. But one huge, and very naked, male fighter has claimed Ada as his prize for winning in the pits. But the wily pit boss puts him up against a small child, knowing full well he could win the fight but lose Ada, a lose-lose for Lothan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lothan may be the new king but he loves nothing more than blowing off some steam in the pits. He did not expect his next bout to bring his Alara to him! Now he must save his Alara, tend her wounds, fix the piece of rubbish translator she was forced to accept and then go about wooing her. Piece of cake, surely? Well it's obvious he's never had to deal with a human female before!\n",
      "\n",
      "Between Ada's frequent escape attempts, possible rebellion by his brothers to usurp his position as possible Emperor and investigating the slavery that Ada uncovered, Lothan's got his hands full!\n",
      "\n",
      "Plenty of scorching hot chemistry, snarky banter and an engaging storyline. There are plenty of brothers, one to suit any taste in male MC you prefer. I really enjoy it when the Female MC is clearly out of her depth but still comes out swinging! Lothan may be possessive but he's not demeaning towards Ada and when they finally can communicate he tried to understand her and her points of view, even when they go against his protective instincts.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is goint to be a rant so apologies in advance.\n",
      "This book was so frustating! I never disliked an h sooooo bad, honestly so stubborn for no reason when the H was on her side and doing everything for her. You can push away for not believing the things that are happening but it was just too much at some point. I felt bad for the H putting up with that. He wasn't perfect but he deserves better.\n",
      "To be fair, I didn't like most of the side characters either. Not even the world-building makes me like the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pace was awful too, it just felt like the same thing over and over again for so many pages with the heroine being stupid or insecure or in denial and the H trying to prove they were mates and trying to rule his planet. The only reason I finished the book was that for most of it the heroine talked about her sister as if she was a saint and I wanted to see if she was rescued at least, but I was sooo close to just giving up.\n",
      "I have read a lot of Alien books, this is probably the worst I read and I won't be continuing the series, especially since Jaya is the next book and she was almost as annoying as the h and it wasn't her book.\n",

      "Do you prefer Larry McMurtry's modern stories (\"The Last Picture Show\", \"Terms of Endearment\", \"Duane's Depressed\") or his historical ones (\"Lonesome Dove\", Comanche Moon\", \"Anything For Billy\")? Recently I've decided that I really enjoy his modern novels more. Be that as it may, in June I started his four book Berrybender Narratives series. \"By Sorrow's River\", which he wrote in 2003, is Book 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Berrybender family of England is making a grand tour of the American West. Lord Berrybender, an outright idiot, actually believed the excursion would be just that - a grand and jolly hunting frolic, giving him the opportunity to shoot game unknown in England: bison, elk, antelope, grizzly bears. He gave no thought to the obvious dangers such a trip exposed him and his family to: Indian attacks, extreme weather, injury, etc. In Book 3, the company wrap up their time at the encampment near the source of the Missouri, and begin southward toward Santa Fe. Where is Santa Fe? In Mexican (Spanish-ruled) territory! Another danger!\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the biggest plot thread running through the books is the love life of Tasmin Berrybender, the Lord's eldest daughter. She has married the frontiersman Jim Snow. That union has proved challenging and full of disappointments for both of them. Although they are physically very compatible, they have different ideas about how they should behave as husband and wife. Jim is used to solitude. He frequently rides off for days or weeks at a time, scouting routes and hunting opportunities. Even in encampments, he cringes at the prospect of sleeping inside a tent or, God forbid, a building. He does seem to be bonding nicely with their toddler Monty. He quickly tires of Tasmin's conversations. He has struck her when she curses. Tasmin loves Jim but is unfulfilled. She needs a husband who shows her his love by listening to her and being at her side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pomp Charbonneau is a trapper and guide traveling with the group. During an Indian attack near the end of book 2 he is shot in the chest with an arrow. Tasmin stays by his side after the arrowhead is removed, and becomes deeply attached to him. But after he recovers, her passion for him is only mildly reciprocated, and she feels compelled to become more aggressive. As Book 3 approaches its end, Pomp falls into grave danger...\n",
      "\n",
      "Some new characters enter the story in this book. Two European journalists and their assistant are on the march across the prairie trying to track down the company. They know their readers will be mesmerized by juicy stories of daring exploits in a country teeming with savages and wild animals. And enter The Ear Taker. A mysterious predator who has never been seen who sneaks into camps by night and slices off the ears of sleeping human prey.\n",
      "\n",
      "McMurtry is known to be an expert on the actual history of the American West, and has written nonfiction on the subject as well. There were a couple of developments in this novel that sounded plausible as actual fact, but I can't be sure. The Sioux make war on the Mandans and the Rees because they trade with white men and thus attract more white men to the area. Mexican forces (under Spanish rule) sent (before the time of this story) a company of cavalry to attempt to stop the Lewis and Clark expedition from entering into former Spanish territory. Maybe someone can help me out - fact or fiction?\n",

      "==============\n",
      "'By Sorrows River' continues the story of the Berrybender safari into the dark plains and deserts of 1833 America! The Berrybenders are a ragged group at this point in their exploration, having had many disasters by accident and Indian fights. However, nothing deters the alcoholic Lord Berrybender from his desire to shoot every animal which crosses his path, not the deaths of kith and kin, not the unsuitable marriage of his daughter, Lady Tasmin, to an uncouth mountain man, Jim 'Sin Killer' Snow, not the births of babies to his daughter and his mistress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tasmin is a force of nature - strong, willful, tempestuous. As the book opens, she is very angry with her husband. He once again has disappeared into the Wild scouting with Kit Carson, unable to tolerate the claustrophobia of living within a trading post or camp. Their baby is healthy, but Monty already is having accidents exploring around the horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emotions are high among the women. Tasmin's sisters, traumatized Bess, teenager Mary, and even 4-year-old Kate (formerly Ten), are falling in love with the tough hunters, handsome Indians, and adventure-seeking aristocratic men they see every day. Tasmin has needs she cannot control, so one of the more attractive men about her, Pomp Charbonneau (Sacagawea's son), has more than caught her eye - she has fallen in love with him. Everyone in camp knows, but since almost all of the women who have been traveling with the family have been playing musical chairs in their love lives, no one cares. Only Snow is clueless. The other women are paired up with various men - at least, as long as the gentlemen haven't yet been killed in an Indian fight - so the dramas of Tasmin are only larger than life because of her beauty and spirit..\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the deaths of most of the people who the Berrybenders had hired to accompany them on their journey from the Missouri, where they had abandoned their rented boat, to the Yellowstone River, where they had met a variety of fascinating mountain men, and to where they were now currently camped in the Valley of Chickens where a fur-trading meeting had taken place, none of the family had been homesick to date. But now, even though they were on the last leg of their trip - to visit Santa Fe - inexplicably homesickness has suddenly struck many of the characters. However, the call of the Wild West, the daily challenges and excitements of their trek, and the fascinating characters who continually rotate in and out of their journey are still drawing the family onward to see more. But perhaps the fact that to get to Santa Fe means crossing a desert without water would have caused them to stop if they had only known it. The 'Sin Killer', never a very talkative man, neglects to inform them they will have to ration water until only they have entered the desert...\n",

      "==============\n",
      "We pause in our heedless wanderings to think and ponder and wrestle with relationships. Well not a pause in the journeying, but during the journeyings, between actually getting anywhere and anything else happening, we get our interlude of romantic complications. Or anti-romantic complications. Poor Tasmin, falling out of love with her fierce, taciturn, wandering husband, and into love with a gentle, passive, guide without a lustful bone in his body. It's a typicially McMurtrian triangle, where desire and personality and timing and opportunity and geography all fail spectacularly to harmonise, leaving everyone confused, miserable and tortured. And then Indians come along and torture them. Well, no. Maybe. Not for lack of trying.\n",
      "\n",
      "With more babies on the way and balloons in the air and smallpox on the river and a long dry walk, we must brace ourselves for the death to come, and come it does, and if we've had horror and brutality and senseless violence, McMurtry, like a literary conductor who has expertly woven individual themes out of familiar motifs, builds to a new and novel crescendo of actual heartbreak that leaves the reader sitting, fuming, knowing that you shoulda seen that coming, or something like it. God dammit. Now I've got to read the last book and I know he's got to top the ending of this one and I'M VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE BABIES.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I love the lyricism of McMurtry's description of West Texas. Quite apart from his people and the development of their lives and character, he writes about the desert, the dust, the heat - all - with evident reverence and heart.\n",

We know that El lives in an apartment but we don't even have enough to put together in our minds what the apartment looks like etc. El gets a tattoo on her back that is a large piece that holds meaning for her but I didn't have enough info to build a picture in my mind as to how it looks. Yes, some authors go overboard as they build the world that their characters live in, but in this case it was just the opposite.\n",

There are more books around these days that end with a cliff hanger then there are ones that have a solid ending, this book has neither of those endings, but it does comes across as being unfinished.\n",

She was a coward, selfish, stubborn and self-destructive. I wanted to throw something at her just in case she woke and realized what she was doing.

A lot of these use the same 'logic' but applied differently, often to meet the type of data one wants to acquire. It all comes down to the three usual tenets of visualistion, association and location, but these can indeed be manipulated in a variety of ways. Some are 'easy' and can be used immediately while others require more work.\n",

      "Several techniques are presented. What I would have loved is that these techniques were made easier to understand and memorize.

I read it AND did the exercises; I now have a memory out of this world. The bottleneck from-short term memory to long-term kind of vanishes. It is hard to understand why, but location, association and imagination when memorizing does the trick. Anyone should at least be aware that there really are working techniques to enhance memory is all its aspects, and this book is a good place to start. It's short as well.\n",

Some of it is pure fun and not terribly useful - for instance, I don't think it is necessary to know what day of the week any given date from the past 100 years is, but that would be a cool party trick. I plan to teach my kids some of these strategies, such as the Journey Method and Mind Maps to help them with their homework as they get older. I also like the idea of exercising my memory as I age! I highly recommend this book and think I will buy a copy of my own.\n",

      "This is the last book in the series, and it was a good one. While I really enjoyed this series, I am ready for it to be over. I think all of the books were good -- some better than others -- but I feel that love stories in this small town will become repetitive. I'm glad the author decided to conclude on a good note and not draw it out. This book -- while a bit predictable -- did contain some of my favorite characters such as Tally, Courtney and Bobby. I didn't really like AJ at first, but he grew on me and became a good person towards the middle of the book. I would like to go to the Magic Cafe and Belle Island, which sounds like such a lovely town. I hope my friends there remain happy. Cheers!!\n",

The next two years, AJ spent traveling and partying with friends all over the world. The last group ended up getting him in trouble with customs and his father threatened to cut off his access to his trust fund unless he went to the beach and stayed out of trouble. As if the beach could help him, thought AJ. However, he soon met Courtney and became infatuated with her simplicity and her views towards family. Bobby, however, scared him to death. AJ had never been around children much less a very active six-year-old boy. Could he learn to like Bobby and to keep dating Courtney or would the world step in and cause all of it to blow up?\n",

      "Morgan's best friend and boss Kabita has received some bad news, her cousin has been murdered and it looks like she was killed by a species that are supposed to be extinct. Morgan offers to return to London with Kabita and help her uncover exactly what happened to her cousin but she also has a bit of a secret agenda and is hoping to track down the vampire who attacked her several years ago. Was Kabita's cousin really killed by a dragon and if she was how will they track down a killer from a species that hasn't been seen in centuries?\n",

      "I have to confess that I wasn't the biggest fan of the first book in this series. I felt that Kissed by Darkness had a lot of potential but hadn't managed to live up to that and there were a lot of things that irritated me about the story and Morgan in particular. It's fair to say I had reservations about continuing the series but I wanted to give it a second chance for three reasons; firstly I have read a lot of series that don't have the strongest start but have developed really well in subsequent books and turned into favourites; secondly I have been desperate to find more urban fantasy books with a London setting and although this whole series isn't set in the UK I knew this instalment would be; finally this book has dragons in it - I absolutely adore anything dragon related so that was the reason that really sold me. I have to say that Kissed by Fire was slightly better than the first book but it still didn't manage to wow me and unfortunately a lot of the things that irritated me in the first book continued to irritate me in this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morgan has got a little better at showing that she has some kick ass vampire slayer powers but she still makes several stupid mistakes and she needs to stop repeatedly mentioning how she was attacked by a vampire and gained all of these special abilities. Readers only need so many reminders about things we've heard before - even in a sequel if you're going to recap parts of the first book it only needs doing once, anything more than that and it just gets annoying. The author is also running the risk of taking Morgan beyond kick ass and turning her into an unbelievable superhero by giving her too many abilities. I think there needs to be a bit more balance between the characters and the powers they each have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morgan's libido is still enough to drive me insane, she had actually calmed down a bit during the first half of the book which had me giving a huge sigh of relief but after a certain event with Jack she goes straight back into lust after anything in trousers mode. I am absolutely sick to death of hearing how hot all the guys are and I think it is hilarious that the only men she doesn't lust after always turn out to be the evil bad guys. If only she could realise that the bad guys are always the ugly ones she would save herself a hell of a lot of time and investigation work! I'm also not impressed with the way Jack suddenly turned into a selfish idiot after being such a nice guy in the first book. That just seemed like a convenient way of throwing Morgan back in Inigo's direction and I'm just so over the whole love triangle thing. It wouldn't have been so bad if I liked Inigo more but he was a creepy stalker in the first book and I'm still not a fan.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did like the introduction of the dragons and I hope we get to learn more about their history and the abilities they have in later books. I also want to know more about the Sunwalkers and their connection to Atlantis and the Knights Templar. The discovery of a new relative in Morgan's life means she might finally start to get more answers about her heritage which I think she desperately needs. The problem is that each book seems to focus on bringing a new supernatural species into the equation and so far not enough time has been spent developing the ones that we are already aware of. I'm torn when it comes to this series, there are so many things that bug me but in spite of that I do find the books are quick and fairly fun reads, I'm just not sure that the good outweighs the bad or that I have enough patience to continue reading it.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I have to admit that I am happy I found this series, especially since I have walked away from two or three that I was following closely. The one thing I like about Kissed by Fire is that the author does not drag a storyline on and on, sort of like how just when you think Jayne has caught Red John on The Mentalist after all these years, bam! He still doesn't have him. I am not a fan of storylines that carry on for multiple books, especially major storylines. I like to see some form of resolution in each book, even in a series. I have to say that Shea MacLeod was consistent with very strong writing, storyline, and characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this installment all three of our major players Morgan, Inigo, and Kabita all have their individual story arcs or issues they are dealing with and there is a nice major story arch with the addition of dragons. I love dragons. Another thing that this author does well is flashbacks as a means of giving historical backdrop to Morgan's history. The reader does not get confused with tense or when something is occurring. A few great twists with Morgan's friendships/relationships and I like the way things turned out. I hope there won't be a lot of back and forth because that is one thing that makes me run screaming from paranormal romance along with love triangles. I'm more on the urban fantasy side of things and Shea MacLeod does a wonderful job writing UF.\n",

      "I wanted to check on Shea MacLeod's website for the spelling of Morgan's best friend and boss and had a very welcome surprise. Book 3, Kissed by Smoke, is being released next month. Excellent!\n",

      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "As far as UF goes, this series has been pretty weak. The heroine is a bit of a hot mess despite her ever growing super powers, the mythology is clugy at best, and the books are short on plot. I am not sure that I would say this book even has a complete plot. It sort of ties things up, but not really. Not to mention, that the tiny bit of resolution seems to come out of nowhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationships are about the same. The first book zoomed head long into romantic triangle and then a love connection, followed by a love disconnection. In this book, the heroine\n",
      "spends almost the entire book pining after Jack, then hooking up with him out of the blue, but by the end of the book she loves Inigo. I say, \"Run Inigo! You don't want this drama mamma!\" And what the heck with Jack?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why should this surprise me? I mean, the mythology seems to constantly contradict itself. This power is inherited. Well, no its not, it is actually created. But, it is still kind of inherited after all. And, only dragons can do this one thing. Well, dragons, and demented, bigoted super villains. But it is okay, because soon Morgan will have every known special power in the universe. Thank goodness she doesn't have enough brain cells to rub together to make her a serious threat.\n",

      "Morgan Bailey - first I want to ask, What about Jack??? second I want to say - I would too!!! (read it if you want to know what I mean, wink wink)... Morgan continues her search for the Vampire that killed her 3 years ago, sounds weird but it's definitely true, because her job as Vampire Hunter, takes her and Kabita, her boss/best friend, back to the UK where Morgan met her demise... Kabita's cousin, Alison is a young lady that has been murdered and the funeral is on UK soil, her death looks like it has been by a dragon, but Morgan and Kabita have other ideas... and so their skills are put to good use...\n",
      "\n",
      "Inigo, back in America, runs into a spot of bother and the girls have to rush back - but not before discovering some valid information AND something in addition for Morgan... woah was I surprised when I found out...\n",

      "I am loving these books, Shea MacLeod writes with such an easy flow and the story is on the move constantly. I love the characters and they are just getting better as I learn more about them... I am eager to pick up book 3!!!\n",

      "Okay, so here's the thing: I bought this (and the first book in the series) for 99c each as a Kindle deal of the day back in 2014. And then it sat unread on my Kindle for literally three years because every time I thought about reading it, I'd see that abomination of a cover and nope my way to literally any other book. Seriously, though. Why is it SO PAINFULLY OBVIOUS that she's wearing a terrible wig??? Look at the cover for any book in the series. They're all equally atrocious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was...fine? Like, it was better than the cover would indicate. There were definitely some issues with the writing (it's fairly basic, and there were a bunch of moments where I was like \"Yeah, this book set in England was DEFINITELY written by an American...\"), I wasn't a fan of the instalove elements (or the vague love triangle elements, for that matter), and there were a lot of elements of the plot that were kind of glossed over.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I sped through it in a couple of hours. So. (That said, I'm not sure I'll bother continuing with the series. And yes, those covers are definitely a contributing factor...)\n",

      "I hated to see this series come to a end but it was good as hell. If it wasn't one thing it was another. Kenya dumb ass should have left the country although that wouldn't have worked because once Juelz found out her betrayal. He didn't stop at nothing to revenge. Javier should have thought his plan through before going after Juelz because he had no clue who Juelz and Zelan was connected to. Grandma Lai wasn't for the bs either. She was just as thorough. Ciera and Ari mother had really lost her damn mind. I was shocked the length she went through just to hurt her own daughters. Evidently Angela didn't know the type of people her daughters and mother had in their life because if she did. She wouldn't have tried to pull that stunt. Great series. In the end throughout all the drama, snakes and betrayal. Everyone somewhat made it through.\n",

      "\"Anita Stansfield's final novel in the First Love series is all you've been waiting for-and much more! No one could have predicted the incredible turns this story takes as its characters live out their dreams....and a few of their worst nightmares, as well.\n",
      "\"Micheal and Emily were college sweethearts, but Emily left Micheal, a non-mormon, to marry Ryan Hall in the temple. After ten years of unhappy marriage, Ryan's unexpected death reawakened the dream, and Emily and Micheal (now a member of the Church) married. They moved to Australia with Emily's three, and adding two sons to the family.\n",
      "\"Now marrried eight years, it is difficult to imagine Emily and Micheal have not always been together. Life is good, and thier love is strong. But then, one by one, shadows appear that drive Micheal to distractions. Emily want another child, but his fear of losing her open an ever-widening gulf of misunderstanding between them. And his fear is not centered in this life alone; in the next life, will Emily choose Ryan (to whom she is sealed) or Micheal (to whom she is not sealed)?\n",
      "\"Thus begins a remarkable journey that runs the gamut of emotion. Along the way, you'll feel all the yearning, intensity, and searching for the truth that this family experiences. And you finally come to understand, with Micheal and Emily, that sometimes blessings come only after an exceptional trial of one's faith.\"\n",

      "I loved these \"first love\" books!! I do love to read books that are part of a series, I feel like you just go through so much with the characters, it's always hard to finish them and say goodbye. These 3 I will definatly be keeping and reading again. They are very easy reads, and I really enjoyed them. I actually gained a stronger desire to pray more. The main character Emily has a very strong testimony, even though she has gone through many trials. Her testimony of prayer and her faith make me want to be better. Even though it's fictional, there is truth to her life and story, and it really showed how much power is in prayer. I am sad to leave these books, but my next few are a continuation of some characters from these, so I'm not leaving them completely!\n",

      "Definitely had mixed feelings about this one. The book jumped ahead quite a few years from the last one, and the characters were firmly settled into their life together. The story had its ups and downs as they faced various struggles, and unfortunately, some of their spiritual and emotional problems were drug out over YEARS - definitely longer than seemed necessary for the storyline. As a reader, when I start to lose patience with the concerns of the characters, they just become annoying. Even so, it kept me pretty interested.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "This is the third book in the series and it is much better than the first two. The main character is a little pridefull and it makes it hard to keep reading because you get a little frustrated with her. But I will tell you if you keep reading and get past the first 3 they get much better. I think it has something to do with the fact that you move on to other characters. But you have to reat the first three so you know the back stories.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I have read this series several times and I do enjoy it when I need a little \"real life\"/Utah nostalgia time but this time around Michael struck me as being very whiny in this last book. He has the same debate over and over and just whines about how horribly unfair it all is. This hasn't bothered me in the past, but I found it incredibly annoying this time and found myself skipping these parts almost entirely to move the story along.\n",

      "كتاب را نشر هنوز با عنوان: \"درباره ارتباطات: ده مقاله كه بايد خواند\" منتشر كرده.\n",
      "\n",
      "من خودم معمولا نسبت به اينجور كتابها كه به آدم ميگويند چطور روابطت را با ديگران بهتر كنى بدبينم؛ ولى اين يكى را دربست توصيه ميكنم. مقاله ها نصيحت نميكنند، بلكه واقعا به فرضيه هاى علوم شناختى و روانشناسى استناد ميكنند. همه شان يا نتيجه مشاهدات ميدانى گسترده هستند يا توسط افرادى با تجربه و دانش بالا در زمينه كارى خودشان نوشته شده اند.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "در اصل، هدف كتاب كمك به كسانى است كه ميخواهند مدير شركتى باشند يا با مدير و همكارانشان كنار بيايند؛ ولى خيلى از مسائل مطرح شده به همه روابط انسانى قابل تعميم هستند. همچنين، پشتوانه شناختى و روانشناسى تعدادى از مقاله ها برايم به شدت جالب توجه بود.\n",
      "براى مثال، مقاله اى كه توصيه ميكنم حتما بخوانيد، قدرت كلام، به اين مساله اشاره ميكرد كه در جوامع ما، معمولا بچه ها در گروههاى همجنس خودشان اجتماعى ميشوند، و به دليل وجود كليشه ها، شيوه اجتماعى شدن پسرها و دخترها متفاوت است. در نتيجه معمولا \"دخترها آئينهاى گفتگو را به شيوه اى ياد ميگيرند كه بر بعد نزديك سازى رابطه و تفاهم تاكيد دارد و اين در حالى است كه پسرها آئينهايى را مي آموزند كه بر بعد جايگاه و مقام تاكيد دارد.\" كه ميتواند توضيح دهنده بسيارى از تفاوتهاى به ظاهر باطنى در رفتارهاى دو جنس باشد.\n",
      "مقاله اى ديگر، استرس را از گفتگوهاى پر استرس بيرون كنيد، به اين نكته اشاره ميكرد كه همه ما ممكن است در مقابل نوع خاصى از رفتار آسيب پذير باشيم. براى مثال در مقابل تهمت شنيدن يا رفتار تهاجمى. و توصيه هايى داشت كه چگونه با شناختن واكنش خودمان و آماده بودن، هنگام مواجهه با اين نوع رفتارها واكنش بهترى داشته باشيم.\n",

      "اينها تنها دو نمونه از مقاله هاى جالب توجه كتاب بودند. در مجموع به نظرم كتابى است كه ارزش خواندن را دارد و به خوبى ميتواند فكر آدم را مشغول كند.\n",

      "I am sad to say that my run with these Scottish Highlanders have come to an end. This was the last book in this series, and it certainly didn't disappoint me! It was not as \"wow\" as the others were; but I still thoroughly enjoyed it, and I wish there was going to be more. I will hate to have to say goodbye to these strong loyal clans that I have severely fallen hard for.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only reason for dropping a star in this fifth installment was the fact that there was a lot more war and fighting in this one. It wasn't its sole focus, it just was more prominent as Logan headed out to battle- for reasons I don't wish to reveal! Any friends who know me, knows that I enjoy a lot of sex in my reads. This series though, most definitely does not focus on the sexual side of thing, although there are passionate encounters....just not as many as I am use to. It doesn't diminish the story though, as I feel that Julianne MacLean is a master story-teller, and she is able to paint a very clear picture of all that is going on in her world.\n",

      "A must read series, and for the time being, Book #4 was free, and Books 1-3 were in a bundle for $7.99! So I got this series for very cheap, and it was more than worth it.

      "Good stories are like sculptures. They already exist in the stone, and are waiting for an artist who can see the sculpture inside and chip away the unnecessary parts to reveal the masterpiece underneath. So that marks the difference between a great story waiting to be written, and a mediocre story which was written to emulate a great story.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book, was an attempt of a mediocre story to be great. I have the feeling that the writer was forcing the story to move forward. The story itself has no drive because it doesn't exist. It was created by the writer's sheer force of will. There, it's a highlander romance novel because the writer wrote it this way. What a shame because the characters are interesting. Their interactions however, very artificial. The entire story is artificial.\n",

I find all his books very liberating, pointing to the Word (and Jesus is the Word!) and helping to identify and unlearn wrong, unbiblical thinking. The appendices to this edition are an added, valuable bonus. Another keeper.\n",

      "He says, we should not be led by mind, but we should be led by the spirit. That our spirit bears witness with God's Spirit. Often times, we will get a check in our spirit about things; however, we ignore this and go with what our head says and this can lead us into trouble. He doesn't say to throw away your brains, but to use the spirit that God has given you in combination with your mind and body. I can attest to this personally, as I have had instances in my life where there was a check in my spirit about something, but I ignored it and went with my head or my body, this caused me grief in the end. If only I would have listened to my spirit and the Holy Spirit. But there is good news, God's love covers all our wrongs even when we do miss it (See 1 Peter 4:8). All our mistakes are on the cross both past and present.\n",

      "Let the Spirit of God lead and guide you into all truth. This book will give you tools and examples of how to be led by the Holy Ghost! This is by no means an exhaustive book on the Holy Spirit and I believe from the books I have read by Kenneth Hagin that he had an incomplete knowledge of Spiritual Gifts, as he only mentions the 9 gifts of the Spirit, when clearly there are more than this amount of spiritual gifts in the Body of Christ. I would highly recommend C. Peter's Wagner book for a more comprehensive teaching on the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Still a great book on the Holy Spirit through with a much needed focus on being led of the Spirit.\n",

      "Guardians of Eternity book 17.5. From 1001 Dark Nights. Paranormal romance novella. Can be read as a stand-alone but I’m sure I missed a lot of the series nuances or recurring characters since I haven’t read any of the prior books.\n",
      "Jayla is kidnapped and starts planning her revenge before she recognizes the other vampire. She agrees to help Azrael instead of killing him a second time.\n",
      "\n",
      "A quick action packed story that moves from killing to loving with a visit from a friendly gargoyle.\n",
      "Absorbing and satisfying. I plan to go back and read this series from book 1.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "SLAYED BY DARKNESS is instalment 17.5 in Alexandra Ivy’s adult GUARDIANS OF ETERNITY paranormal/fantasy romance series, and the latest instalment in the multi-authored 1001 Dark Nights series. This is vampires Azreal and Jayla’s story line. SLAYED BY DARKNESS can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty. Any important information from the previous story lines is revealed where necessary\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Told from several third person perspectives SLAYED BY DARKNESS focuses on the abduction and attempted assassination of our heroine Jayla. Jayla works as the manager for Dreamscape Casino in Hong Kong but a rival casino manager has demanded some of Jayla’s time. On her way, Jayla finds herself the victim of a potential kidnapping, only to come face to face with the vampire she thought she over seven hundred years earlier. Enter former Viking turned vampire Azreal. As Azreal presents his case for ‘kidnapping’ our heroine, Dreamscapes owner Chiron calls upon our intrepid gargoyle Levet, to help locate his missing manager. What ensues is the building relationship between Azreal and Jayla, and the potential fall-out as something more sinister is going on behind the scenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Azreal knew immediately the assassin sent to take him down is his fated mate but our hero was cursed by the fey hundreds of years earlier, and his soul has been trapped inside a magical sword all this time but Azreal woke up to discover the sword had been stolen, and his life was slowly draining with each passing day. Desperate to retrieve the sword, Azreal knows of only one being who is able to control time, and that being is the woman that calls to his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "SLAYED BY DARKNESS is a fast paced, novella length story of second chances, of a sorts. Jayla believed she had killed a man for no other reason that having been ordered to do so, and with his return, Jayla got a second chance to make things right.Having been cursed by the Fey, Azreal knew he would probably live a long and lonely life but the return of Jayla meant Azreal had a second chance at his own happily ever after, if only they could retrieve the sword that held his soul. The $ex scenes are limited by passionate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The secondary and supporting characters included Jayla’s boss Chiron, and her assistant Gideon; rival casino owner Emile; gargoyle Levet and his aunt Bertha.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "SLAYED BY DARKNESS is entertaining and engaging; the characters are dynamic-always fun to read about Levet ; the building relationship between Azreal and Jayla focuses on the search for the sword, and the acceptance of one another as each other’s mate.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "It was quick but it was great. There wasn't as much action or romance as full-length books of this series but nonetheless, it was worthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jayla and Azrael (love the names) have a past... moment that she doesn't even realize is still relevant, except in her memory. When after a very long time, the one man who made a killer impression (pun intended) on her comes back, surprise is not the only thing Jayla's feeling. And Azrael has plenty of reasons to reveal himself to the woman who killed him once already, only one of which is the use of her talents.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a guest appearance by a certain vampire Dreamscape owner and everyone's favorite gargoyle (well, every female's favorite), this short novel only makes me want to read the next one. And hopefully, there'll be more to come. Also, I wish to find out what sort of powers called aunt Bertha away. If she's anything like Levet - and they are related - then I'm sure there'll be plenty of chaos and romance wherever she goes.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A romantic and sweet second chance novella is recommended to all romance readers. Ms. Ivy is a magical storyteller as she shares her Guardians of Eternity world in this series. I must say, when the 1001 Dark Nights concept first came out, I thought it was a bit hokey. I am surprised by how many of the authors I read are in this collection. I am really loving the ones I read. This is a standalone and can be read independent of both this 1001 Dark Nights collection as well as Ms. Ivy's Guardians of Eternity.\n",

      "\n",
      "1001 Dark Nights novellas are a great way to try a new series, each release is a standalone usually interconnected. A painless way to dip your toes into different genres, types of storylines, and try authors writing style\n",

      "This book opened up with a bang, but it slowed down for me. The main story line was a little stagnant and overall there was a lack of cohesiveness. Kamani being his basic raggedy self and for the detective to actually trust him was beyond me.\n",
      "I liked Duke and Urvi together...listen once they made their way back together they couldn't keep their hands off each other. They were nasty and had truly met each other's match. Duke made it his business to make Urvi happy and he helped her take back her business and made her dreams of helping women come true. They were finally able to be together.\n",

      "If you wanted the noise then ,this is what you want from the beginning to the very end. The writer brings us back to the drama and let's us know that are main characters are still in peril. The fact that Ceira is standing her ground against Julez has been terrific but I need a little more toughness instead of crying first. I goes without saying that every time Ma Lai in a scene you know it is going to be just a gut buster and a eye opener on the truth. This story gets better as it moves along . The dialogue is just good that you get the visual of hey these characters can actually be saying just that.The chemistry is on point that no time do you experience a lull in the story.This is some follow-up because there are so many twist and secrets that are going to come out and a lot that are going to need to be answered. It's on to the next episode and the next ride with the Kassom family.\n",

But this hero isn’t looking for a mate and tries not to be interested at first. I did really like Garek. He’s protective and sweet and I loved how he loves Piper’s son immediately.

      "There were a couple things that brought this book down for me. Number 1 was the kids. I’m not sure if it was just the narration, but they were super annoying, especially the heroine’s son. He just sounded super whiny all the time and it basically drove me nuts every scene he was in. Also, Piper really wanted to recreate a Wild West kind of thing with their village? It just seemed really strange to focus on. And this is probably just my general dislike of Western romance that colored that but I was not interested in any way anything to do with Wild West and an alien romance wasn’t where I thought I would find it. Luckily the goal seemed to be abandoned halfway through the story or so. I think I just wanted some more world building than what happened here. There's scenes of danger, clan disagreements, clan politics but I wanted to know a bit more about the planet/how the humans came to be there. I had a couple questions left unanswered but they might be addressed in later books in the series.\n",

      "I'm disappointed with this book. I was expecting something more profound or I don't know... not boring, but I didn't get the luxury.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Piper is a single mom, from there I was expecting something big, an super romance with lots of developments and cute bonding moments with the kid. Not happening. I received an annoying kid, super fast and terrible development of the romance, and the one character I was warming up turned out to be a kidnapper.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) I'm not the best in history, at least the US history, but I'm pretty sure the \"wild west\" mission Piper talks about so fondly and wants to recreate in this new planet wasn't exactly a good thing, . So, with that in mind, I don't feel very comfortable with her saying she wants to create a \"new wild west\", of course, she only talks about square dances and karaoke, why would the white woman mind the genocide of the original folk in her previous country? Because the only thing in her mind is the alien's cock.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) I don't think it was a good way to represent her trauma toward men, I mean she vowed to only be there for her son and distanced herself from any kind of romantic relationship. So, why in the next day was she already panting about Garek? Look, I'm trying to be fair here but I was kinda expecting something more or even .\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Piper didn't expend much (written) time with her son, who is the sole purpose she's in an alien planet, to begin with, I found it a little annoying her passing the kid around and only focusing on the alien warlord. Which means she bonded more with his pet than with her son.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) My last point about the story is: Piper's intern monologue was extremely stupid and annoying. I couldn't believe she was thinking that way. \"Oh my gosh, this big burly alien warlord is mine! Wait! Did I just say he is mine? Shut up brain, now is not the time, [insert some random situation in which she has no reason to be thinking about the fucking alien being hers]\"\n",

      "Rogues to Riches series #4. Historical romance. Can be read as a stand-alone.\n",

      "This fourth book in Grace Burrowes’ Rogues to Riches series about the Wentworth family continues with A Duke by Any Other Name, a rather sweet story featuring possibly the grumpiest hero who ever grumped and the woman who engages his attention via a passel of wandering hogs.  In typical Burrowes fashion, this is a gently moving story featuring two perfectly nice leads with emotional crosses to bear that should probably keep them apart, but whose chemistry and fascination with each other conspire to make that impossible.  I haven’t read a book by Grace Burrowes for a while, and picking up this one served as a nice reminder of the things I enjoy about her work – her distinctive voice, her insight into what makes her characters tick and ability to write strong familial romantic relationships – without too forceful a reminder of some of the things that can get a bit repetitive if one reads too many of her books in quick succession.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Althea Wentworth, sister of the Duke of Walden, resides at Lynley Vale in Yorkshire, a home gifted to her by her brother when he unexpectedly acceded to the title (book one, ).  A duke’s sister should be taking part in the season and finding a suitable husband, but given her family circumstances – the Wentworths were born into poverty and their father was an abusive drunk – Althea quickly became the prime target of the ton’s cruellest gossips who have ensured she has been all but ostracised from society.  Althea is no shrinking violet, but she has had enough of the constant bullying and has instead decided to make her home in Yorkshire, and find herself a husband there.  But even that is not going to be easy; the local society’s leading light is Lady Phoebe Philpot, who is every bit as catty as the London ladies, and just as determined to snub Althea and make sure everyone knows her humble origins put her below their notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nathaniel Rothmore, Duke of Rothaven, has a reputation as dark as the large stallion he gallops around the Yorkshire Moors at night.  His neighbours have learned to give him a wide berth; he’s abrasive, unwelcoming and sarcastic, he doesn’t go into society, he certainly doesn’t invite others to his home and is all but a recluse, surrounded by ancient family retainers he should really have pensioned off by now and a house and grounds that could do with a bit of TLC.  It’s clear early on that his reputation as a black-hearted recluse is one he’s cultivated himself – what isn’t clear, seeing as he’s not a cold man, is why.\n",
      "\n",
      "The novel opens with Nathaniel discovering that a number of his neighbour’s prize hogs have invaded his orchard.  Annoyed, he storms over to Lynley Vale to demand that Lady Althea arrange to have the animals removed , only to find himself plied with tea, cake and the polite but – could it be gently ? - conversation of a woman he should absolutely find intriguing… but definitely does.  Her request for help in learning how to deal with the local society on her own terms is surprising – surely, the sister of a duke should have no problem on that score?  - but he gives her a few tips on imperiousness anyway – and she agrees to have the pigs removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nathaniel knows he’s asking for trouble by having anything more to do with Althea.  He can’t court her, he certainly can’t marry her – and yet he’s drawn to her, sensing that in her, he may have found the companionship and understanding he longs for. But it can’t be, because Nathaniel is living a lie.  This information is disclosed early in the book (so isn’t a spoiler, but if you don’t want to know, look away now!) – Nathaniel is not really the Duke of Rothaven.  His older brother, Robert – Robbie – is epileptic and was sent away to an asylum when he was little more than a boy. The old duke told Nathaniel Robbie was dead, and he only discovered the truth after his father’s death, by which time he had been invested with the title and taken his place in the House of Lords.  He was able to get Robbie away from the asylum and bring him home, but his brother was clearly not capable of assuming his responsibilities, so Nathaniel agreed to continue to fulfil the role of duke until Robbie was able to do so.  Five years later, Robbie is much improved, but does not want to take on the responsibilities which are rightfully his.  What is Nathaniel to do?  Telling the truth will see him convicted of fraud against the Crown and could leave Robbie vulnerable to being locked away again.  Nathaniel is stuck between a rock and a hard place and can see no way out.  To make things worse, he’s begun to receive letters which indicate someone knows the truth – and he very much fears he is about to be blackmailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "With so much on his plate, it’s not surprising Nathaniel is so dour. Grace Burrowes is very good at writing these sorts of characters, ones who are thoroughly decent but somewhat bowed by circumstances, and it’s easy to feel for him.  His sadness, exhaustion and loneliness are palpable, and his conflicted emotions for Robbie – love, guilt, anger (for him and with him) and frustration – are equally well portrayed.  Althea is a lovely heroine, strong and independent, but still haunted by a horrible childhood (there is a brief mention of sexual exploitation, but it’s not detailed) and, in her way, as beaten down as Nathaniel and just as despairing of being able to find someone to share her life with.\n",
      "\n",
      " doesn’t sugar-coat the facts with regard to the way people like Robbie were treated at this period (the author provides an interesting, extensive author’s note on the subject) but doesn’t sensationalise it either.  The romance is a sweet, slow-burn and I enjoyed watching the friendship that develops between Althea and Nathaniel blossom into love – and felt their grief and sorrow at the knowledge they couldn’t be together as they both wanted.  On the downside however, the blackmail plotline never really goes anywhere (and is wrapped up rather oddly) and although I enjoyed watching the dreadful Phoebe get her comeuppance, the ending is rushed, the sudden influx of the families – Althea’s brothers (and sister-in-law), Nathaniel’s mother – in Yorkshire feeling a tad too convenient and, if I’m honest, there as a way to shoe-horn in some cameo appearances.\n",
      "\n",
      "But those criticisms aside,  is a low-angst, enjoyable story laced with the author’s unique brand of warmth and humour.  Althea and Nathaniel are sensible, likeable individuals who make an exceptionally well-matched couple, and anyone looking for an undemanding, emotionally satisfying read could do worse than give this one a try.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "3.5 ⭐️ Althea, a duke’s sister, was considered a spinster and her neighbor Nathaniel, a duke, was a confirmed recluse. They are both hiding out in the country and avoiding polite society for their own reasons. The duke is hiding a secret and Althea is uncomfortable with her recent surge in her position in society. Nathaniel is deeply devoted and loyal to his family, tender and playing the role of the Dread Duke to protect family secrets. Althea is witty, not conventional, and can quickly deliver a well played set down. It was fun to listen to these two banter. Nathaniel’s servants were a humorous bunch of meddlers that played their role well. I love a strong heroine in historical romance that can deliver sharp retorts. I had a couple gripes though. There was a few characters added that didn’t do much for the plot and weren’t well developed and probably could have been excluded. The other issue was it seemed off how casual the sex was handled. We know Althea is thrusted into the aristocracy and her background is of poor beginnings however she described the limits she maintained in that environment. Their romance followed a contemporary pace rather than historical romance. Overall, I did enjoy the book and I look forward to Constance and Robbie’s story next.\n",

      "\n",
      "When her brother unexpectedly inherits a dukedom, Althea is thrust into the world of social splendor and social backstabbing. She spent most of her childhood trying to survive and protect her siblings, so the intricacies of navigating jealousy and competition for bachelors is beyond her. Having a duke next door, even if he is a recluse, could be the answer to her problems, though.\n",
      "Nathaniel wasn't supposed to be the duke and he is starting to chafe at having to wear the mantle. When he finally descends on his neighbor to tell her to keep her pigs in her own yard, he can't help but finally feel alive when sparing with her.\n",
      "Secrets that are starting to feel constraining and a chemistry that can't and doesn't want to be ignored, are heating up the Yorkshire moors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the Wentworth family and their friends, the Rogues to Riches series delivers its fourth installment staring Althea, the oldest sister. In previous books, she was the straightforward sibling that could come off a little abrasive. In her own story we get a look at how she was left to take care of and protect her younger siblings from their alcoholic father while their elder brother Quinn () went out to try and make money. When her family inherits the title, she becomes Lady Althea and not only gains the prestige but jealousy, with one particular enemy in a Lady Phoebe. With Phoebe making snide remarks and spreading innuendo about her, Althea needs help with learning how to navigate polite society as she does want a husband and family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nathaniel is Althea's neighbor on their estates outside of York and is a recluse as he shuns society. At first he seems like a grumpy bear just wanting to hibernate but when we get a pov from his mother, that hasn't been back to the estate or seen her son in years, we get a tease that maybe Nathaniel is forced into keeping out of society. Then we are introduced to his brother Robbie, who supposedly died years ago, and learn that Robbie was the older brother and Nathaniel isn't the true duke. This is revealed in the first half and I don't count it as a huge spoiler as the majority of the book is about Nathaniel and Althea growing to love one another but Nathaniel not seeing a way they can be together because of the tangle it would cause and possibly revealing Robbie is still alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Burrowes is always good at the subtle but sweet and loving emotions between her leads and Nathaniel and Althea wonderfully showcase that talent. When they have their first meeting you can almost feel Nathaniel coming alive as Althea snips and pushes back at him as he outright refuses her request to tutor her in the ways of polite society, while also slipping in advice to her. The angst to keep them apart, Nathaniel trying to protect his brother, added depth to the story, his character, and made you hurt for this family. Robbie looks to be the hero in the next book in the series and I'm looking forward to seeing how his connection to Althea's sister Constance occurred and see him get his happily ever after. The struggle and love between Nathaniel and Robbie was felt but their mother's struggle wasn't completely understood for me. She had a bad relationship with her husband so she hated the estate but how it felt like she suddenly just decided to go back and help felt rushed; her whole inclusion in the story felt a bit out of place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Althea's background and how that shaped her was heartfelt and will have you feeling for her as Nathaniel tells her to never beg, at first not appreciating the strength and courage Althea displays in doing so. If you are a reader of the series, you'll appreciate the glimpses of the Wentworth clan and their strong and loving familial bonds, Lord Stephen, the younger brother makes his usual charismatic appearance and I can't wait until we finally get his book.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I did think the second half dragged for a bit as the threads of Nathaniel not thinking he could have a life in order to protect his brother and Lady Phoebe trying to force society to hate and shun Althea slowed down too much in their route to conclusion. I also thought that Nathaniel spilled the beans to Althea about Robbie a bit quickly and their first sex scene felt gently abrupt. However, if you're looking for a sweet comforting read, Althea willing to prod and poke at Nathaniel was great and this couple had a lovely charmingly amusing chemistry that will warm your heart.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "4.5/5. I really enjoyed this book. Yes, the plot was slow-moving but the characterisations were wonderfully complex and the dialogue just outstanding. I rather enjoy the fact that the plot was not over-complicated but allowed the focus on the romance and the writing. For all his ducal formidableness and his hauteur designed to keep himself aloof and apart, Nathaniel hides a soft heart as evident by his willingness to sacrifice all for his brother and his concern for a lonely, abandoned damsel with only her impressive wit to keep her company. Of course, he himself is no stranger to loneliness and social isolation. Both Nathaniel and Althea made for highly sympathetic characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought the basis for the story was rather fascinating, the pickle that Nathaniel found himself in did appear so insurmountable. The cast of secondary characters were well portrayed, adding both substance and humour. GB delivered a well-researched and believable story, writing with an elegant and easy hand. She casually slips little colloquialisms relevant to the era in the dialogue. It is a joy to read, not just the clever wit but also the authentic-sounding prose. This can be read as a stand-alone without difficulty.\n",

      "WHY: Several years ago, defense attorney Mickey Haller made a connection with prostitute \"Gloria Dayton\", felt he made a positive difference in her life. Now she's been murdered, and he finds that he has been deluding himself about the success story. He's taken on the defense of her supposed murderer, her pimp Andre La Cosse. A complicated yet engrossing plot involves cartel boss Hector Moya, serving life due to being set up by Gloria; a rogue DEA agent, and a retired cop. The team that supports Haller is intriguing as well. I did find that some of the stuff in Haller's personal life got in the way of the narrative.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "John Bevere’s Driven by Eternity is reminiscent of what is arguably one of the most famous sermons ever preached: Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God by Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758).\n",
      "\n",
      "When Jonathan Edwards first preached his now famous sermon on July 8, 1741, the response was amazing. The congregation in Enfield, Connecticut, where Edwards was a guest preacher, was filled with cries, shrieks, and moaning as people called out, asking how they could be saved. Edwards’s passionate warning had convinced them that they were desperately close to being thrown into the endless torment of hell.1\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, hearing a sermon preached and reading a book are two different things. However they are not disconnected. For, infallible Scripture says, “For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe.” 1 Corinthians 1:21. Thus human wisdom believes that a) the act of preaching the Gospel is foolishness. And b) the Gospel message is foolishness. Therefore to the unconverted the publishing of Driven by Eternity is a foolish exercise – a complete waste of a tree!\n",
      "The aforementioned ‘foolishness’ being understood, John Bevere shows his readers Heaven while showing them Hell. It’s as if he is saying to the reader, ‘Look, here’s Heaven and there’s Hell,’ as he dangles them over the edge of the fire-filled pit – perhaps like a turkey roasting on a rotisserie spit. Jonathan Edwards did likewise to a group of church attendees many years before. Said Edwards to them:\n",
      "\n",
      "Your own wickedness weighs you down like lead and is dragging you down toward hell with great weight and force. Again, if God would let you go, you would immediately sink, quickly descending and plunging into the bottomless gulf. All of your health and personal care, all of your best schemes, and all of your own righteousness would no better support you and keep you out of hell than a spider’s web would stop a falling rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, we’re not reviewing Jonathan Edward’s sermon, but perhaps in a future edition of Driven by Eternity John Bevere might consider including the Calvinist Jonathan Edward’s Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God as Appendix C of his book. It would be so appropriate, and the response might have been ‘amazing.’ But three cheers to Bevere for shocking Christians into taking stock of their lives in relation to eternity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Premise & Content\n",
      "Driven by Eternity has an Introduction, thirteen chapters and two Appendices. Bevere uses a lengthy but interesting allegory to assist the reader in understanding eternity and the reader’s place in it. In order to have the reader from the very outset ponder eternity Bevere, in his Introduction, draws the reader’s attention to Sydney’s the late Arthur Stace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stace, post conversion from a life ‘filled with petty crime and alcoholism,’ did something strange but remarkable. ‘Arthur would rise early each morning, pray for an hour, and leave his home between 5:00 and 5:30 A.M., to go wherever he felt God led him. For hours he would write one word, eternity, approximately every hundred feet on the sidewalks of Sydney.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, by arguing that Stace was a man ‘driven by eternity,’ Bevere immediately gets the reader to contemplate the deeper meaning of eternity. Then, for the purpose of illustrating the reader’s relation to eternity, Bevere begins his allegory. The allegory reflects Jesus, God the Father, Satan, the human being’s life on this earth, the heavenly city of God, and the dreaded lake of fire. It is a story well told. And, because of some of its characters therein, it can’t help but remind the reader of that great allegory The Pilgrim’s Progress, by John Bunyan (1628-1688).\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress, Bevere in Driven by Eternity seeks to show the reader the many pitfalls encountered along the way by the Christian on his journey to the ‘Celestial City,’ or in Bevere’s case, Affabel, (i.e., the New Jerusalem). To a certain extent Bevere succeeds in his endeavour. He represents some of the various personalities commonly found in the worship community of God (i.e., church attendees), by use of descriptive names such as Independent, Deceived, Faint Heart, Selfish, Charity, and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sub-title of Driven by Eternity is Making Your Life Count Today and Forever. In Bevere’s own words:\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the focus of this book: Making your life count not only today, but throughout eternity. The Bible is clear about how to do this. If we are to be motivated by the eternal, let’s start off by getting an understanding of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then follows a couple of quotes from the Bible regarding eternity. Then he quotes a couple of contradictory dictionary definitions of eternity to illustrate that the understanding of many regarding this subject has become vague.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bevere holds to the premise that ‘We are saved by His grace.’ However, like the contradictory dictionary definitions regarding the meaning of eternity, Bevere holds a contradictory view to the already mentioned Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758), and John Bunyan (1628-1688), regarding the meaning of being ‘saved by His grace.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, Bevere also would be offside with John Newton (1725-1807) – the slave-trader who God saved by His grace. Thus, were Bevere to be consistent with his Driven by Eternity, he could not sing with conviction the well-know words of the hymn Newton penned post-conversion: ‘Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me, I once was lost but now am found, was blind but now I see.’ For, according to Bevere’s take on salvation (as he espouses in Driven by Eternity) these words at best can only be understood as tentative.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lord knows that we have no wish to denigrate the man John Bevere, but the reader needs to be alerted to Bevere’s faulty theological understanding as expressed in Driven by Eternity. In clear but blunt terms, Bevere has immersed himself in the peatbog of Pentecostal theology. His Driven by Eternity is a by-product of the labyrinth of the contradictory extremities of contemporary Pentecostalism. Bevere claims to hear and see ‘voices and visions’ – which he, without objective proof, alleges is God communicating with him one on one. He also gives unqualified but wholehearted endorsement of the ‘voices and visions’ experienced by others, for example, Kenneth Hagin.\n",
      "\n",
      "As one would expect from anyone trapped in the dark and dank dungeon of aberrant theology, the eerie sound of chain-rattling and chain-dragging contradictions to the clear ring and teaching of Scripture are heard too often in Driven by Eternity. Indeed, Bevere puts the whole Bible through the mincer of Dispensationalism. Alan Cairns warns us of one of the main pitfalls of Dispensationalism regarding the Gospel. Says Cairns,\n",
      "\n",
      "The most dangerous element in the dispensational scheme is that it affects the very basis of the gospel of salvation by grace alone, through faith in Christ. It posits the idea that man has been on probation all along and that God’s mercy is displayed in giving him a new trial after every failure, thus holding out the possibility of salvation by works of obedience…\n",
      "\n",
      "Thankfully, there is evidence that many dispensationalists are awakening to the failures of the system. Even in moving away quite radically from its fundamental tenets, they hold on to the name. But that name is too fraught with theological error. As Reginald Kimbo argues, dispensationalists must recognize the error, admit that it continues in the system, be clear on the soteriological effects of it, and entirely repudiate it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the following we wish in particular to take issue with what is perhaps Bevere’s chief aberration: that those whom God has truly saved by His grace have the power to ‘walk away.’ Thus in Driven by Eternity Bevere builds his house upon the sinking sand of faulty premise For example, in reference to John 10:28-29 Bevere has ‘Jaylin’ (who represents the Lord in his allegory) state the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "No one can pluck you out of my hand, but I never said you couldn’t walk away. You alone hold that power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the premise and content of the book is a lengthy apology or defence for the false and demoralising doctrine that someone who is truly saved by the grace of God is not truly saved at all!\n",
      "\n",
      "Faulty Conclusions Drawn from Faulty Theology\n",
      "The upside of Driven by Eternity is that Bevere occasionally pops his head out of the murky swamp-water of faulty theology to breathe fresh air. His book seems to be a genuine attempt to deal with the ‘Decisionistic Easy Believism’ of Pentecostalism – a culture which has been steeped since its inception in a theology attended by ‘Altar Calls’ and a ‘Sinner’s Prayer’ – whereby people, because they have repeated the ‘Sinner’s Prayer,’ are told that they have now become Christian converts. Says Bevere:\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only are those who’ve never heard, or refuse to believe the Gospel in bondage, but many typical ‘converts’ of this generation are in bondage as well. We’ve created this dilemma by neglecting to proclaim the cost of following Jesus. Many assume they are free but in reality aren’t and the evidence is in their lifestyles.\n",
      "\n",
      "We wholeheartedly agree with Bevere’s statement just quoted, for Scripture speaks of ‘bad trees’ producing ‘bad fruit’ or ‘evidence’ of non-conversion. Whereas ‘good trees’ producing ‘good fruit’ is ‘evidence’ that the Holy Spirit has regenerated that particular individual. ‘Good fruit’ is the result of the Spirit working in the Christian’s heart. Take as an example of this the following verse of Scripture, ‘But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.’ Galatians 5:22-23a. Therefore, the true Christian ought to be confident in the promise of God that ‘He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.’ Philippians 1:6.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fruit in the Christian’s life is not only the ‘evidence’ of the Christian’s regeneration, but, more importantly, it indicates that that God is true to His Word and that it is God who has all the power of salvation and not the Christian. For, it is God who begins the ‘good’ work. The Christian is powerless – being beforehand in bondage to sin, self, and Satan. If indeed God has begun a good work in someone’s heart, it is not the Christian who will complete it, but Almighty God. Therefore the Christian does not have the power to ‘walk away,’ i.e., pluck himself out of the Lord’s hand as Bevere alleges.\n",
      "To teach a loss of salvation is nonsense because God does not convert ‘bad trees’ into ‘bad trees.’ Rather He only ever converts or changes ‘bad trees’ into ‘good trees.��� And since ‘good trees’ (i.e., true coverts) produce ‘good fruit’ (by the power of the Holy Spirit working in and through them) these ‘good trees’ don’t produce ‘bad fruit.’ Therefore, a ‘good tree’ cannot reject God because rejecting God would be extremely ‘bad fruit.’ Thus rejection of God is clear evidence of being unconverted regardless of any prior seeming conversion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Parable of the Sower Jesus illustrates what Bevere is mistakenly portraying as a loss of salvation.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A sower went to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it. Some fell on rock; and as soon as it sprang up, it withered away because it lacked moisture. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it. But others fell on good ground, sprang up, and yielded a crop a hundredfold.’ When He had said these things He cried, ‘He who has ears to hear, let him hear!’\n",
      "Then His disciples asked Him, saying, ‘What does this parable mean?’ And He said, ‘To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest it is given in parables, that Seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. Those by the wayside are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. But the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy, and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away. Now the ones that fell among the thorns are those who, when they heard, go out and are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity. But the ones that fell on the good ground are those who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, keep it and bear fruit with patience.’ Luke 8:4-15.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that the parable does not speak of anyone losing salvation. Rather, the parable indicates, that there are those who, though they seem to be numbered among the saved, prove to be otherwise. No doubt this is why Scripture says, ‘Do not lay hands on anyone hastily…’ 1 Timothy 5:22a. It comes as a shock and is bewildering for a Christian to see another who was so ‘full on’ for Christ ‘walk away’ from Him. But, in light of the Parable of the Sower we ought to expect to see this from time to time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bevere invokes Hebrews 6:4-6 to prove his allegation that true Christians can lose their salvation. But we interpret Scripture by Scripture. Therefore keep in mind the Parable of the Sower as you read what the writer to the Hebrews says:\n",
      "\n",
      "For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame.’ Hebrew 6:4-6.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hear again what Jesus said regarding some of those who have ‘tasted the good word of God’ but have fallen away: ‘The seed is the word of God… The ones on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy, and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away. Now the ones that fell among the thorns are those who, when they heard, go out and are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity…’ Thus some ‘fall away.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The Apostle John speaks of those who ‘… went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but they went out that they might be manifest, that none of them were of us.’ 1 John 2:19. Then later in 1 John 5:19, he says, ‘There is a sin leading to death. I do not pray that he [i.e., Christians] should pray about that.’ 1 John 5:16b.\n",
      "In the following, Martin Duffield refers to those who have tasted ‘ the good word of God’ but have rejected it, i.e., those who have ‘walked away’ from Christ, as the ‘terminally sinful’:\n",
      "\n",
      "The terminally sinful, for who Scripture says we should no longer pray are men and women who have known the truth but have now turned from it, they have known the law of God and will not now submit to it and who have heard the call to love one another as Jesus loved us but now refuse. In these things it would appear that they have crossed the line and belong to that dreadful category captured in the words of Hebrews six, ‘it is impossible to renew them.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "There are many gold nuggets in Driven by Eternity, but it is such a pity that the reader has to crawl around in the decayed and dangerous mineshafts of Dispensationalism and Arminianism to find them! Bevere’s challenge for Christians to live godly lives by keeping God’s Commandments is heartening. His exhortation to do so in order to secure a good seat in eternity is not – although we thank him for the timely reminder that as Christians we ought to be thinking in terms of eternity. However, as Christians we ought to serve the Lord out of love and gratitude for the salvation He has purchased for us on Calvary’s cross. We ought never to presume upon His grace as we strive to love Him with all our heart, all our soul, all our strength, and all our mind, and love our neighbour as ourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a delight to read in Driven by Eternity of a Heaven that is a real and solid place for real and solid (saved) human beings. And it was good to read about the real and solid New Earth to which the real and solid New Jerusalem descends. Yes, there are some aspects even of these things where we’d beg to differ with Bevere on the basis of Scripture. For example, Bevere speaks of a resurrected Christ who walks through solid walls. However, this is nowhere taught in Scripture. Indeed great care needs to be taken here not to confuse the two natures of Christ and have the divine nature absorb the human nature of Christ even for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bevere then ascribes the same divine attributes to resurrected Christians in order for them to do likewise regarding solid objects and also to traverse vast distances at the speed of light by their own power. This is to distort the true nature of man even in his glorified state. To be sure, the resurrected saint will have immortal and incorruptible qualities, but as God always remains God so man will always remain man.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "I took my time reading this book. John Bevere is truly an inspiration to Christians everywhere. Man, would I ever like to sit down and talk to him personally. Bevere doesn’t shy away from the topics of sin, judgment, hell and salvation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bevere writes: “We determine how we will build, and we have two major choices in our constructing every moment of our life. One is to gravitate toward the temporal, that which appeases the flesh (wood, grass, or straw). The other is to live in line with our born-again spirit’s desire, the eternal Word of God (gold, silver, and precious stone). How we build, or how we live our lives, will determine how we fair when the fire of His presence examines our work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most important things that I became enlightened to in reading this book, is that \"faith\" is not something that we reach for, but is is something that we \"release\".\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend this book. I,too, believe that there will be many shocked Christains when we stand before Jesus Christ on Judgement Day!\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "So at one level I found this book incredibly inspiring. The volume of scripture quoted was a huge encouragement. He even quoted often from the apostolic fathers! That's rare but refreshing. But I also felt at times he spoke authoritatively about some of the personal words he received from God, as if they were true for everyone and the exact interpretation of the verses he quoted. Thus some of the points were a bit overstated. The opening drama illustrates this in some subtle ways. So I wouldn't want to recommend this book to everyone - especially a new believer. I think it requires maturity to absorb appropriately (I think I just called myself mature... that's not what I meant). At the end of the day, I'm glad I read it and will read it again. The main thrust of the book: to live in light of eternity and not let the values of our world dictate our priorities... that's a message I can't hear enough.\n",

      "This is possibly the most life changing book I have ever read. It's helped me change my priorities and world view.\n",
      "The writing is simple without diminishing the content, you can almost hear Johns voice reading the book.\n",
      "I am particularly appreciative that each chapter built on the preceding one, and the thoughts were based solely on Gods word.\n",
      "Because of this book, I am more focused on living each day with eternity in mind. Seeking to bring Him alone glory.\n",
      "Finally, the allegory is simply spell binding. I could almost image myself in Affabel.\n",

      "I would love to find a small group of women, 4 or 5, who ardently desire to become saints, true saints, with holy lives of heroic virtue, who would spend a weekend retreat with this book.\n",

      "March 27, 2014: We finished our 10 week retreat using this book and I’m so glad I stuck it out. It’s been a roller coaster ride at times, as are most retreats—well the effective ones anyway—those which draw us closer to Jesus. As with any relationship, but even more so when it comes to God, the loving must precede the knowing, so He allows the pain that we can truly understand Him. This is not to say He is a God who only desires our misery, or even wants us to be unhappy. On the contrary, He wants joy for us, total joy in Him and not for selfish reasons but because He knows He is what we truly hunger for; He is our destiny. It is usually our choice to seek something less than joy and to look for it somewhere other than in Him. Therefore He meets us in our own suffering and helps us draw good from it. He does this by drowning the drop of our pain in the ocean of His Passion.\n",

      "Our group was smaller (by 2) than when we began and we had endured a number of tragedies, such as the accidental death of one member’s 4 year old cousin, the break-up of another member’s significant relationship, not to mention minor illnesses and other less obvious life changes. Even so we were ready to sign our pledge to do all we can (in prayer, word and deed) each day thus bringing consolation to Our Lord in response to His own great outpouring of Mercy to His Suffering World.\n",
      "\n",
      "A beautiful experience overall and one I hope to repeat again in a few years. There are a number of appendices to this book which merit owning a copy and keeping it nearby for easy reference, especially those for discernment of spirits. I cannot recommend this retreat or this book enough.\n",

      "February 21, 2014: Last night as I was listening to Fr. Gaitley (on the DVD which accompanies this book) it seemed that in learning to love Jesus as taught in this retreat, I'm simply learning to really keep the First Commandment. How one, ? I've always wondered what such total love looked like, and how it could be lived out by a little soul such as myself. Difficult theological books depress me because I can't understand them or figure out how they apply to ordinary life. I can't hope to impress God with my knowledge, and who else is worth impressing? Great saints often discourage me with their incredible sacrifices and heroic virtues. Fr. Gaitley says Jesus understands all this and doesn't expect or want us to be to be other than we are. In fact, He little souls for their very littleness, because in them He can demonstrate His own Greatness as our God. He wants us exactly as we are, where we are. But He wants us to come to Him in trust and to be with Him constantly assured of His greatest attribute, His Mercy.\n",

Our human appreciation of Divine Mercy, in turn, grew out of the Church’s traditional understanding of Our LORD’s revealed treasures contained with His Sacred Heart. Here, in this book, these three beautiful spiritualities are braided together to form a new way of developing a deeper and more responsive relationship with Jesus. It offers many helpful insights into common fears, objections and pitfalls to which we are all prey—whether we are cradle Catholics of many years, new Christians, going through some form of spiritual ‘Dark Night’ or even intimate friends of Our LORD, very familiar with the art of prayer.\n",

I can't recommend this enough.\n",

You know what would help us all get through the plague that has had us stuck in our houses for the past 6 months? New cars.

      "\n",
      "After reading Hunted by the Others, the first book in the H&W investigations series, I had lumped it as stereotypical comfort food for UF fans. Sure Haines had a very unique world where the Others are governed by law and can't just change people willy nilly. There was still something missing for me and with book number two I figured I'd get another 3/5 book. Haines definitely blew me out of the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plot picks up and swings nicely into the world of the Others, taking on a much more satisfying turn. The last book our leading lady is basically pulled up into the events by mere petty chance. This time Shiarra needs to except that she's in this for the long haul, because once you've opened your door to the monsters there's no shutting them out. Especially when one of New York's most revered vampires has taken an interested in you.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite part about this second installment is that events allow the reader to enter the realm of the White Hats. Considering they're Other haters and have taken some pretty nasty actions against others and humans a like, I still found myself time and again cheering for our pin toting bigots. Not everyone wearing the pin of the White Hats want to eradicate the filth at all costs. By the end of the book it brings into light that the White Hats and Others may have some of the same goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this vast improvement of plot and pacing this book moves along beautifully. The reader can truly sink in. While I feel that the side characters from before (mainly the Hunters Belt *ahem*) where forgotten, you don't miss them long. New White Hat characters come up and they are a hoot! Shiarra is faced with her biggest fears, being held against her will and her blood drained. Then her biggest nightmare happens, becoming a mindless slave to her \"master.\" My grip on the book was so intense that I actually left indents because I was so absorbed by the nightmare Shiarra was living.\n",
      "\n",
      "The love interests did not get enough page time in all the action to develop. Chaz is basically a pouting wolf at the end, being irrationally upset that Shiarra was throwing herself at Royce even though she could not control it. If I was Chaz I would be upset too, but not to a point that there couldn't be some healing. At the end of the book it felt like Haines thought she had given the reader enough development between Royce and Shairra to make the reader switch teams. Personally, at the end of this book, Shiarra needs to run, run away from him. I just can not buy Royce being in love with her, it's too unrealistic for what we are given.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end the only thing that truly stopped this from being a 5/5 book was Shiarra's stupidity. I'm not going to tiptoe around it. Shiarra's lack of smarts in the first book was a sore point for me, but I figured that it was the first time she was running for her life so she could make stupid decisions. Shiarra forgot key points about the Hunters Belt, and still didn't know when to hide or take the evil villains threat seriously. It was like flashbacks to the first book. Shiarra's struggle with the dark side of the belt was definitely a saving point for her character development. Still I can't believe a vampire like Royce would want Shiarra. She's not naive, she's stupid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Haines has proven with this latest installment that she is an up and coming contender in the sea of books populating the UF genre. Be prepared to find a living nightmare, explore the White Hats, and see the true evil of the the Others. This book is an Adrenalin rush and you'll want to have all day and night to read this one!!\n",

      "Jess Haines’ Taken by The Others is the second installment in the H&W Investigations series featuring Shiarra (Shia) Waynest as a private investigator who works and lives in New York City. She is one hundred percent human like her business partner Sara and was once fully entrenched in the Anti-Others feelings like her parents. Things have since changed since Hunted by The Others, the first book in the series.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shia is still contractually obligated and bound by contract to Alec Royce, the elder vampire who owns half of New York and was one of the first vampires to come clean about the existence of vampires after 9/11. (See Hunted by The Others for more details)\n",
      "\n",
      "Shia is also back with her werewolf boyfriend Chaz who Shia had previously managed to run away from after learning the truth about his inner wolf. The only thing that is keeping them from going horizontal is Shia’s refusal to be changed from being a human into an Other with the exchange of bodily fluids. Can’t say that I blame Shia for her stand on not wanting to be bound and changed since most writer’s take the view that it’s better to change the protagonist, than to allow her to remain human.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taken by The Others picks up approximately 6 months after Shia was beat down, put in the hospital, and nearly killed after helping take down a vampire named Anastasia and her mage lover. Now, Max Carlyle the dead vampires sire, has come calling for retribution against those he feels were responsible for her death and Shia is right at the top of that list along with Alec Royce who he has a very, very long history with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jack, the leader of the White Hats, once again shows up un-expectantly and tells Shiarra that he wants her to join their organization as a hunter and to stay away from the Others. He truly believes that she is a necessary part of their plans to defeat the Others. Ever since Shia got her haunted Hunters belt from the Council of Mages, she has become a White Hat target for recruitment. It is Jack who tells Shia about the arrival of Max to New York and his intent on talking to her about what happened the night that Anastasia was killed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This series is unique in the way that it deals with relationships between vampires, werewolves, mages, humans, and other supernaturals. Humans and Others are required by law to sign a contract called the Notice of Mutual Consent to Human/Other Citizen Relationship and Contractual Binding Agreement in order for a sexual relationship or a blood transference can occur. It’s supposed to be a protection for both parties, but it tends to favor the Other’s rights over humans who choose to get involved with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Shia’s case, she was lucky enough to have Sara on her side and was able to twist and modify the agreement so that it is mutually beneficial to her as well as Alec which allowed her to escape not being turned into a vampire. Once again in Taken by The Others, Shia makes some glaring errors in judgment and her bad mistakes nearly cost her in terms of her own life, her will, and her eternal soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are plot twists and surprising characters (Mouse and Dawn Hartley) that show up and steal the show away from Shia and the others. I hope that Haines continues their story into the next installment in this series and not just puts them on the back burner where we will never see them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not 100 percent convinced that Shia makes a kick-ass protagonist as of yet. When she has her belt on, she still questions the reason behind the things she does. She hesitates when vampires nearly kill her, and only by the belt taking total control is she even remotely able to survive. I still want to see her not think so much, and act the fool when it comes to saving not only her own life, but those of her friends as well.\n",

      "TAKEN BY THE OTHERS proves that even ancient vampires aren't above acting stupid over a woman. And, not only that, but these two elders are too self-involved to realize that the heroine doesn't actually want either of them, because she's already dating a hunky werewolf named Chaz. MEN! Granted, their motivations are slightly different, however at the end of the day it all comes down to jealousy. Six months have gone by since the previous installment, and Waynest was still under the misguided impression that she could walk away from the Others' universe, well this book certainly cleared up, and then some! I love me a good super villain, and we get that in spades with Max Carlyle—epic battles, betrayals, and sacrifices ensued as a result. That first kill is always the toughest, but consider Shiarra officially initiated into the elite club of vampire hunters. BOOYAH!\n",
      "\n",
      "Becoming a kickass protagonist is never easy, and Waynest was most certainly put through her paces in this latest novel. She gets kidnapped on several occasions, experiences her first (and second) fanged kisses, and beats one of her assailants to a pulp. She also gets bound to not one, but two vamps, and overcomes the symptoms of blood withdrawal in all of their glory. However, when the dust finally settled, she was still standing, and in Urban Fantasy that's the only thing that counts. I have enjoyed following Shia's journey from human P.I. to don't-mess-with-me slayer; I liked how Haines explained her insta-skills in HUNTED BY THE OTHERS, and then made her hit rock bottom in book 2. So many authors brush over the harsh learning curve that comes with their lead character's heroine status, but not Jess, she let readers witness Waynest's transformation in all of its gruesome magnificence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plot's rather self-explanatory, just read the blurb and you'll pretty much get the gist of it. I thought that the story tied in well with the previous novel while also adding to the H&W INVESTIGATIONS world nicely, and ensuring that this series will continue to gain speed in future installments. Another supe gets added to Haines' already teeming paranormal cocktail in the form of Dawn, the elf supermodel, and the White Hats show their true colours. I can't say that I was overly shocked by the latter, but at least Devon and Tiny demonstrated that not all members of their order are bigots. I also enjoyed learning more about this universe's vampires including more details about the Others' contracts, blood bonds, and their internal politics. The final powwow was an action lover's wet dream, and meeting Mouse was a real delight—I hope that this won't be the last we see of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not completely sold on the direction of this series' romance; I like Chaz, but I just don't know. He gets mad props for sticking with Shia throughout her recent ordeals, and bonus points for staying the course without a contract, because no paperwork = no sex. They've officially been on-again for six+ months now, and surviving that long without knocking boots is a huge challenge for your average Joe, but for a werewolf it's nigh impossible IMO. It's either true love, or the man is a complete sucker. I personally like Royce as a match even though his true motivations remain unclear. I know, I know—me choosing fangs over fur that has to be a first! It's just that Chaz hasn't really shown any alpha tendencies, and I didn't particularly care for his reaction to Waynest's blood bond woes, although I did sympathize with his reasons.\n",
      "\n",

      "Taken by the Others is the second book in Jess Haines’ H&W Investigations series. No I did not read book one. I know, I know, so not like me! Well, there was a slight mix up and I got book two. But you know what? It turned out okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book opens with Shiarra, our heroine, having to talk someone down who just happens to have a gun pointed to her head. Yeah. I have to tell you, with an opening like that, you know you are in for a fast paced read.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked Shiarra even though I found that her fear of vampires and being bitten was a little bit much at times. Then again, that is her phobia and therefore she is allowed to be scared senseless I suppose. I found myself giggling at what she was saying and thinking through the book, and I always love when a character can make me giggle. She and the other characters in this book certainly kept me well entertained. I enjoyed seeing some of the White Hats (Other being hunters) learn that their perception of the Others was not quite accurate. I enjoyed reading Devon (he would make a great novella hero). And I really enjoyed Royce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alec Royce is a vampire. An old and powerful one. She is suave and charming, in his own way, and he (we think) has eyes for Shiarra. You can tell that he isn’t used to being told no or to being told to hold off, but he does his best for Shia. But man can you ever tell that it’s taking every ounce of restraint he owns! Shia wants nothing to do with Royce, not only because he is what she is most afraid of, but also because she has a pretty serious boyfriend in Chaz.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t get much of a feel for Chaz (and leader of one of the Werewolf packs in town). He isn’t in the book much and what we see of him well…let’s just say there isn’t much talking. And no I don’t mean because they are too busy doing the nasty – I mean because he’s a wolf and can’t talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story itself was pretty good. A vampire wants an eye for an eye after what happened in book one and he seems to feel that Shiarra is that eye. So he tries to kidnap her. Sometimes he succeeds and sometimes he does not. But it does make for quite the ride.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though the end felt a tad rushed to me (bam your fighting, bam you’re gone, bam your lover is hurt, bam you run off), I enjoyed the pace of the rest of the book and the overall feel of it too. Interesting characters set in an interesting world. I really like the idea that vampires are restricted by law and that you have to have a legally bound contract before being turned or bled. Pretty neat.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not feel lost or confused at all while reading this book – seeing that I did not read book one. That said there were a few details that I was very curious about their origins. The belt for example. And how Shiarra met Royce. And how long has Shiarra been in a relationship with Chaz. And why is Shiarra so darned afraid of vampires?! These are all things I would assume are explained in the first book. And although I didn’t feel lost of confused, I did find myself wanting to learn more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Am I planning on reading the next book? Eventually for sure, yes. I am very curious to see where things go with Shiarra and Chaz. And let’s not forget Royce. No, let’s not forget Royce.\n",

      "New York P.I. Shiarra Waynest has quite the problem in the second instalment of the H&W Investigations series by Jess Haines. TAKEN BY THE OTHERS starts off with a little trouble in paradise between Shia and her werewolf boyfriend, Chaz. When Chaz misses their date, Shia strikes out by calling in Alec Royce, the most powerful and lethally gorgeous vampire in New York for some business. But when her doorbell rings, Shia faces someone much worse than Alec Royce...\n",

      "Max Carlyle is coming to town and he has his sights on Shia for killing his progeny, Anatasia. When Shia faces Max’s goons, she soon realizes that Max wants a lot more from her than she first thought. While it seems that Royce has some plans of his own involving Shia, they don’t seem to involve her death like Max's does. As the personal battle between Max and Alec escalate, Shia gets sucked in more and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "While TAKEN BY THE OTHERS starts off a little slow, it does pick up in its pace closer towards the middle and all through the end. I enjoy Ms. Haines’s writing style. She pays a great amount of attention to detail and I can definitely appreciate that. However, it can drag on a bit and slow down the pace. For me, this only happened in the first part of the book while in the latter half, she seems to tighten things up a bit more.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the great things about this series is the world that Haines has created. With the White Hats, the vampires and werewolves, it’s jam-packed with the supernatural. But what’s more interesting is the fact that Shia, the heroine remains a human in all this and can still keep up (with the help of her belt). While I did like Shia in this book, I hoped to see more of a growth in her character in future books. I felt like she was exactly the same from book 1. But one thing I hope that never changes about Shia is the fact that she still has vulnerabilities. I love that in a heroine. It makes them much more relatable.\n",

      "The men in this series are great! Alec Royce is still sexy and Chaz still gets on my nerves sometimes. I do enjoy his possessiveness, but as is natural for weres, he has a temper. I hope to see more of Shia and her relationships with Royce and Chaz because I think it’s one of the many driving forces of this series.\n",

      "If you’re thinking about starting this series, then I suggest reading book one first. HUNTED BY THE OTHERS contains a lot of events that will make more sense when you read this one.\n",

      "In the second Stranded book, things get worse for the Benson-Diaz kids as the wreck of their boat, the not-so-lucky Lucky Star finally sinks, leaving them without shelter and supplies on the deserted \"Nowhere Island.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Only a book aimed at pre-teens would put a nine-year-old (and siblings) in such danger. The kids really get put through the ringer in this one. Unlike in other deserted island survival books, they can barely start a fire, can't collect shellfish or catch a fish, and building a shelter is hard. It's a surprisingly realistic book, especially given its target audience.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Personal Response: I like this book because it is about exploring an island that they become stranded on and looking for materials to survive with. It is also really fun to read because of all the stuff they do in the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plot: Vanessa, Jane, Carter, and Buzz are stranded on a Jungle Island in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean. The trip was supposed to be a fun trip for their parents' honeymoon in Hawaii. Vanessa and Buzz are siblings and Cater and Jane are siblings, so they don't get along because they are step brothers. They were going to a fishing trip with their uncle for them to learn how to get along together. Their shelter, named the , got lost in the storm. During the storm they found a cave but don't know what's inside of it. They were suffering from the chilly weather at night and trying to look for a way to make a fire. They heard a really high pitched noise deep inside the cave. Everything started to shake, and they were trampled by hogs. They found water inside the cave, but the water was contaminated by all the bats. Carter became sick from drinking the water, he felt better in a day but still felt weak and couldn't really help much but he pushed through the pain. They decided to move to the beach because the hogs came back and attacked them and wasted their only flare to scare them away. They built a house out of bamboo sticks and found out how to make a fire with a piece of glass that they found in the lagoon. They ended up finding the lucky star and found flares, blankets, jackets, pillows, pans and a can of food. They started to cook snails and ate them after their food ran out. Vanessa tried to put some sticks in the fire but accidentally burnt the dry leaves on top of the bamboo house and lost some of their resources. After that happened Vanessa I guess felt bad and ran away. She found skeletons of human beings somewhere in the island that she never explored. To be continued... The main theme about this book is “teamwork” they need to work together to get things done and work as a team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation: I recommend this book to anyone who likes survival books and that like to figure out things.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Personal Response-I thought this book was alright. The book made every little thing that happens drag on. I enjoy reading stories about survival. This book has a lot of that in it. The story was also action packed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plot- This book is about four new step siblings that survived a boat crash and found themselves deserted on an island in the middle of the South Pacific. This book seemed very unrealistic. The boat that sank in the Pacific Ocean somehow washed to shore at the same island all the kids were on. After seeing the boat washed up on shore, they went to investigate. They walked up on the deck and saw that everything that was there is now gone or destroyed. They went up to the main part of the ship and found an old radio. The radio was soaked with water and did not have power. Then Jane saw something familiar, it's the SAT phone that is on every ship for emergencies. She grabbed the phone and saw it had a little life left on the battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Characterization- There are four main characters in this book. Two of them were brother and sister and the other two were step brother sister. They are on vacation, sailing the sea, when a huge storm comes and wrecked the boat. Carter, Vanessa, Jane, and Buzz were their names. Carter and Vanessa are brother and sister. Jane and Buzz are also brother and sister. Together they all make a good team. Carter is 13 and the oldest out of the four. Buzz plays video games and knows a little about survival. Jane and Vanessa no nothing about survival. They are normal 10 and 11 year old girls who spend time doing their makeup and texting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Theme-The main theme was man vs nature. The theme fits this book because four kids were going against nature to survive. The way those four kids put their heads together and were able to live longer than a few days was amazing to me. It's amazing what humans can do when death can come at any second. They all hated each other at times, but in order for survival they would have to get along.\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting- took place on an undiscovered island in the South Pacific. The island had thrown many surprises at them. Wild boars coming in stampedes chasing them and venomous animals. They describe the weather as hot during the day and 50 degrees at night. They had bad storms that were knocking over trees and creating mudslides. The book takes place during present day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation- I recommend this book to any middle school that like the outdoors. I do not recommend this book to anyone older than 14 because it is written for small kids, yet the book is the size of an average high school level book. I would suggest this book to boys. Because boys tend to like the outdoors more than girls. I gave this book a three out of five stars.\n",

      "I just placed this book in the easiest to reach place of all the cookbooks in my kitchen. It’s definitely made it into my informal top 10 cookbooks section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless you are a masochist, don’t read this book on an empty stomach or even if you’re even a little bit hungry, not unless you have enough ingredients on hand and the time to make at least one of the included recipes.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the book she thanks her testers. I know they work hard at giving her useful feedback but THEY SHOULD BE THANKING HER!!! It sounds like the best volunteer job ever!\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m trying to lose a bunch of at least some of the weight I gained 6 ½ years ago, and cookbooks such as this inspire me even more, because they show that healthy eating can be so very delicious and not too difficult to achieve re food preparation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is another gorgeous book from this author! Truly! It has a beautiful layout, wonderful color, including colorful rainbow pages and page edges for finding contents more easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love that the focus is not just on the green orange, and yellow we all hear about incessantly, but covered is the entire spectrum of color: red, orange, yellow, green, blue/purple, white/tan, black/brown, and the rainbow, and each color has its own section which includes: starters and salads, soups and stews, sides, main dishes, and desserts. At the end of every color section, there’s a Ways to increase (whatever color) foods.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with her other cookbook(s), each recipe indicates if oil-, wheat-, or soy-free for those who have dietary restrictions, and also included is if additional ahead of time preparation is required. Nutritional information is given for every recipe for amount of calories, fat, percentage calories from fat, protein, carbohydrate, dietary fiber, cholesterol (none, of course, since every recipe is vegan) and sodium. The helpful blurb boxes in her other cookbook(s) also reappear: compassionate cooks’ tip, food lore, and Did you know? There are also entire page sections with all sorts of “extra” informative material. In each color’s section she also gives some information about why that color food is so important for our health.\n",
      "\n",
      "This author recommends eating whole foods that are low in oil and sodium. Some of the recipes do contain oil and salt, but alternatives are suggested. For those who don’t cook with oil but when fat is helpful in certain dishes for absorption of nutrients purposes, nuts and seeds and avocado are mentioned as foods that can be added instead of oil, and many recipes already are given that way. I am confused though as on one page she mentions that the recipe is fat free but it includes flax seeds (they do have fat) and non-dairy milk (most have some fat.)\n",
      "\n",
      "She does use quite a few foods I don’t like: vinegar, mustard, tempeh, coconut, non-dairy yogurt, etc. but for many dishes, I like all the ingredients and for those that have foods I don’t enjoy, it would be easy to leave them out or make substitutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has 2 indexes at the back of the book and both are very useful. The first one is an ingredients index and the second one is a recipe index, listed by color. She has a resources section that is very helpful, although it is short and not comprehensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dishes I particularly want to try (and oh did I have difficulty limiting these to just a few per color; there are many, many more) are:\n",
      "\n",
      "from red: Six-Shades-of-Red-Soup; Beet Burgers; Stuffed Shells with Marinara Sauce\n",

      "\n",
      "from white/tan: Parsnip Soup; Roasted Garlic Soup; Cashew and Red Lentil Burgers (but no eggless mayonnaise for me as I don’t like it); Oat Bread\n",

      "Oh, but there are so many more recipes in here that also appeal to me. This book earns 5 incredibly bright stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will add that I don’t have the kitchen, various cooking implements or the money to buy them or the space for them, and definitely not the cooking skills the author possesses, but many of these recipes seem doable for me.\n",

      "I'm not a vegan, or even a vegatarian. If you want to be specific, I am a lactose intolerant, chocolate-loving, eggs only in baking, flexitarian. However I do love to cook and eat vegan food, as you don't rely on meat and gravy for your flavour so you get inventive. This recipe book was nutritious and delicious. As I am not a vegan there are some substitutes I don't have - e.g., when I bake I use eggs.\n",

While I understand that they are fundamentally different books, I wasn’t wowed by the presentation or sidebar information found in this book.\n",
