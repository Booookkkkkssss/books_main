      "Full Disclosure: I Owe Part of My Heart to Kindle Alexander\n",
      "\n",
      "My use of the title of one of Kindle Alexander's best books (well, they are all \"best books\" in MY book) to lead off my headline of this review is done for two reasons: 1) It's the theme of the book, and 2) it's personal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's get the personal out of the way. I have corresponded with Ms. Alexander for a couple of years because I just love what she does with men who have some serious issues about loving other men. A lot of authors do this very well, but she does it for such a wide cross-section of men in so many situations that I just kept telling her this, and she kept writing back and we had some very nice philosophical discussions (by e-mail only, we have never met or talked or Skyped or connected by social media), and shared some personal histories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I was completely taken aback when I saw to whom she dedicated this book--Bo--and I sent off a missive asking if she knew someone else by that name, and she said, \"no, silly, it's you.\" And I nearly died on the spot--after my jaw hit the ground. Full disclosure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just so you don't think I was unduly influenced by this unbelievable honor, I wish to let you know that it took me a few days to let that settle in, and then I started to read, nervously. After all, what if I didn't like it? And, actually, the first couple of chapters, which concentrate on a bit of a family crisis in the life of computer genius and Dallas semi-mogul Dylan Reeves, threw me for a bit of a loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the jacket blurb of the book does a good job of setting the reader up for a potential romance between him and computer genius and Laguna Beach mega-mogul Tristan Wilder, the exquisitely handled introduction of Dylan's family--wife Teri, daughters Chloe and Cate, son Chad--has me shaking my head: Is this going to be one of those books where one MC, i.e., Dylan, is straight as a Texas arrow and we are getting set up for a sloppy seduction process by an admitted player in Tristan Wilder? This man Dylan Reeves is a completely devoted husband and father, and you could not even imagine where Ms. Alexander is going with this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until the last couple of pages of Chapter Two--wherein you discover that the title of the book is not only the name of Dylan's high-tech company, but also the definition of virtually every little plot twist that comes along. And, wow! Do they twist and turn--but with such deft segues, beautiful writing, and extraordinary sexual heat that you ultimately cannot put the darn book down.\n",
      "\n",
      "This one took my breath away in every way and in every chapter. It's fast-moving but not capricious, to the point but not nasty (well, one little incident is, but that's expected), mind bending but never outrageous in its premise that two alpha males just over the 35-year-old divide can blow their lives apart, but agree not to keep doing it, until there is no choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is never a choice in this book for continuing to have secrets--which is why the title of the book, the name of the company, and the plot twists are so cool to contemplate. No, the reason there is no choice is because Dylan Reeves is one of the great characters to have emerged from the M/M contemporary romance novels I have read (and there are many): He lives his life on integrity, except, of course, for one part of it which some might say qualifies him as a hypocrite, but not when you get to know him. He is walking honesty personified, and he manages to change people's lives with that honesty and integrity without leaving the other people, or the reader, raising skeptical eyebrows--a testament to Ms. Alexander's fertile imagination.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he has a wife who as a major positive player here may stun you at first, just as much as how a conflicted Tristan thrashes about trying to wrap his head around a man he cannot figure out, may take you aback at first. But when you get wrapped up in this tale, and this family, you will wonder how many other couples are in the same situation, and how few of them deal with it as this one does.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a book that will challenge you to guess when the next secret is disclosed, and how these people will deal with it. That Ms. Alexander will toss a nice little bomb in your path to each of those discoveries will rivet you to the page, this tale, and to these characters.\n",

Dylan has built a social network app that allows people to chat and then the chat completely disappears, leaving no trail. He’s gone as far as he can with it and is ready to sell so the company can be taken to higher levels. Dylan’s company, his app, is called Secret. Which is appropriate because Dylan has so many secrets. Secrets he’s been living with almost all of his adult life. You also need to know that Dylan is the best kind of man, honorable, trustworthy. His family is his world. A world he’s sacrificed everything for.\n",

It’s exactly what he needs, an area he hasn’t been able to excel in within his own company. He’s willing to do whatever it takes to win this bid, including wining and dining the owner and his employees while they present their offer. But, as soon as the owner, Dylan Reeves, walked in, every thought, every plan he had walked right out the door. All he saw was the man, a man he wanted.\n",

      "Tristan had never been in a real relationship. His work was pretty much his life. Dylan had no experience, having lived his life in the closet. The sparks between these two could light up several city blocks. But, Dylan’s walls were firmly in place around him. And let’s not forget the fact that Tristan is buying Dylan’s company. Could these two have any more road blocks in their way? I loved watching the transformation of these two, especially Tristan. He was pretty much flummoxed by his feelings for Dylan. He just wasn’t a relationship guy, up to that point anyway. He found himself willing to do anything to win Dylan over, to give him a chance. Even pretending to be a jogger on a long run and almost killing himself in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What a wonderful, well written book this was! I both respected Dylan for how he lived his life and he also frustrated me. I wanted him to fall so hard that he couldn’t deny Tristan a single thing. And he did fall hard and fast but still tried to make the right choices. I do want to add in here that his three kids are absolutely amazing! He and his wife Terri, clearly did a fantastic job raising them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

I went back to read some reviews after I finished the book and the positive response for this book from my GoodRead friends is overwhelming. I'm glad for that, especially since I'm such a big fan of Kindle Alexander's books and have given all of them 4 and/or 5 stars. But this one did not work for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, since the blurb indicated that one of the main characters was married with children, I wanted to know if there was cheating involved before I started reading it. I'm not one who absolutely read a book with cheating (one of my favorite books of all time is Cameron Dane's where cheating is a huge part of the plot) but I like to be prepared, especially since children were involved. I don't think it's a spoiler to tell you that there was here. Dylan and his wife Teri are together only for their kids and Teri is actually involved in a two year relationship with another man when Dylan meets Tristan.\n",

Tristan Wilder wants to acquire Secret at all costs after his own company's foray into the social media business has failed spectacularly. When Dylan and Tristan meet, there is an immediate attraction, but it thankfully isn't insta-lovey where they felt the need to rip each others clothes off in the stairwell. But we do hear both men's inner monologues and the attraction is there and mutual.\n",

Tristan can see that Dylan is uncomfortable and suggests the two of them leave the group and visit another establishment that would be more to their liking. This is where my problem with Tristan starts. Tristan is all promises to Dylan that he won't force him to do anything he doesn't want to do.\n",

The next day, he finds he is enamored with Dylan that he offers the Secret team 20% then their asking price and all the stipulations they were asking for. On one condition: That Dylan agree to drive with him at sunset in his Ferrari and have a picnic on the beach.\n",

Flowers, Ferrari's, private dinners with Wolfgang Puck as their chef, elaborate hotel rooms, etc.\n",

I wasn't able to enjoy any of the sex because it felt just a touch dirty to me given Dylan's inexperience and Tristan's pushy tendencies. I personally , but for my one negative review, there are so YMMV. Either way, I do hope enjoy!\n"
