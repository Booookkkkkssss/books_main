      "This is a collection of short passages on everything about mathematics - from the origins of Algebra to a rap about the Hadron Collider. For someone who happens to be mortally petrified of anything to do with math, it is a huge feat to get me to enjoy a subject I positively dread. I would recommend it to both amateurs in this field (like me) and experts who wouldn't mind a few laughs.\n",

      "I unintentional loved this book. Let me explain, I came to the book expecting a science book (which this book isn’t) and was expectedly disappointed. The more I read the more I realised this book is essential a science trivia book. This is the best description of it. It doesn’t talk about specific field or specific scientists. It has stories, poems, really lame jokes, equations, book recommendations, first this and first that, drawings, historical events, etc. The only theme sewing all this together is science. It is a great book for these minutiae. You’ll sure care about some stuff and don’t give a hoot about others, and this is normal for a book of trivia.\n",

      "Another reason I like the book is that it introduced me to many interesting new science-related things. Basically, the tabs in my phone browser increased by a tenfold.

      "I loved this eclectic little mix of all sorts of snippets of science, scientific principles with the odd joke and poem thrown in for good measure. It was such a mix up and collection of all sorts of fields and disciplines, it definitely kept me engaged and the turnover of information was so quick, it didn’t give me a chance to get bored!\n",
      "\n",
      "This book included all sorts of the little things that normally get skipped out of popular science books, and I not only learnt a fair bit but also fleshed out some of the things I already knew with add ons of extra information.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s easy to read and entertaining too, and I’m not embarrassed to say I totally repeated some of the jokes too although as to whether they laughed is debatable (I did!). I also loved the addition of the fusion of science and poems, which is something I hadn’t really read before and actually really enjoyed reading.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This book caught my attention when I was at my local library and I couldn't resist checking it out as in my other life away from blogging, I am actually a (geeky) scientist. On the whole, it was filled with some interesting facts and trivia and I did manage to find out things that I didn't previously know, which was my aim of reading it, as my speciality is usually biochemistry. Some parts however, I did find a bit hard to get through, and anything involving physics went right over my head I'm afraid! So, just an idea what scientific treats are in this book - we have the Periodic Table, binary, the Richter scale, biological classification, genetics, evolution, threatened and endangered species and a short history of the atom to name a few. But don't worry, if this all sounds a bit scary, the author makes things a bit lighter with poems and diagrams and even several scientific jokes:\n",

      "\"The moment a bar of gold walked into a pub, the landlord shouted A U, get out!\"\n",

      "Or how about some real molecules with some very funny names? Like ARSOLE - a ring molecule containing arsenic and DIUREA which it should be no surprise to learn that it is used in the fertiliser industry. If that didn't really float your boat how about an experiment or two that you can do at home? For example, making your own pH indicator scale that tells you how acid or alkaline a solution is simply by using some red cabbage, a kettle, a pan and some glass jars or bottles. There is also a second experiment that allows you to measure the speed of light using just chocolate, a microwave and a ruler. Sounds fun, right? Or how would you like to compare your intelligence to a fifteen year old taking exams in 1858 with a few example questions. On second thoughts, maybe you don't want to do this, I was hideously embarrassed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, there is a great little Appendix in the back of this book (although I wish it had been larger and included reminders of the physics education I am sorely lacking) and it gives a great little summary on the structure of atoms, the biology of the cell, some basic genetics and explanations of Newton's laws. In general, I did enjoy this book and am glad I read it and definitely appreciated the lighter side that the author brought to the text, proving that yes, science can be interesting and fun!\n",

      "I have a list of popular science book ideas that I occasionally revisit – things I quite fancy writing in the future. Now I have to cross one of them off the list, because Simon Flynn has written it for me. My list describes it as a popular science version of Schott’s Miscellany, but Flynn has called it by the (to me, rather clumsy) title The Science Magpie.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least, that’s what I assume it is, because I have to confess, I’ve never read Schott’s Miscellany, so I don’t know what it contains – I merely assume it’s this kind of kaleidoscopic mix of all manner of facts, from the quite interesting to the downright weird. It’s the sort of book you can imagine Stephen Fry curling up with of an evening before hosting QI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inevitably in such an inspired hotch-potch there will always be some entries that inspire more than most. I loved, for instance, real molecules with silly names, the 1858 Cambridge University exam questions and the curly snail periodic table. Other parts are more ‘Hmm’ moments, like a whole page of digits of pi, while still others simply get a little dull. Often this is a transcription of a historical document – I have fallen for this one myself. They fascinate if you are researching the particular topic, but to the general reader they can fall a little flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nice thing though is that, even if there’s a topic that doesn’t really grab you, you know that in the next page or two there will be something completely different. There is no order to all this, it is just stuff accumulated at random, like one of those wonderful old fashioned museums where you get a Victorian vacuum cleaner alongside an Egyptian mummy. Delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone ought to know what grabs the science reading public’s attention it’s Flynn, who used to be MD of Icon Books and is now training as a science teacher. I know this is going to be a book that will find its way into many science loving people’s present piles.\n",
