Did they think that the winding river was the highway of extinct races, whose skimming light canoes did cleave the same waters in centuries long ago? Did these maidens in wide bonnets, these lads in straw skimmers and bowties, dream of aught but innocent love and beauty and desire as they drifted on languid oars down waters of youth and summertime!

      "\"Raintree County\" is an American version of Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\".\n",
      "I've actually read \"War and Peace\". Lockridge's \"Raintree County\" rises to that level--and, in my estimation--surpasses it. I love the Russians--Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Turgenev. And I love Walt Whitman and Ross Lockridge for the same reason. They all have what the Spanish call \"duende,\" what the American blacks clamor to express by the word \"soul\". These aren't weak, spineless, effete Victorians afraid of beauty, passion, shame and awkward emotions.\n",
      "They cast light into the dark corners of the human soul and throw open man's collective experience for all to see--something rarely achieved in typically dryer Anglo-Saxon literature.\n",
      "Ross Lockridge's \"Raintree County\" astounded me. It left me wondering how this great American genius has been ignored, neglected. The only thing I can think of is that Lockridge makes the fatal mistake of being honest, of writing too accurately about the time-period, of not lying and indulging in historical revisionism. As a result, spineless readers wince when the \"N\" word is used, or terms like \"pickannies,\" \"darkies\" or various other period vulgarities are employed by despised side-characters.\n",
      "For this reason geniuses like Booth Tarkington are banned and suppressed.\n",
      "It's sad. They want to revise the past and make it \"acceptable\" for modern audiences. But if you sanitize, you gut, you neuter, you destroy the hard edges which give the time-period texture, verisimilitude. (I mean, if slaves were well-treated why did we fight the Civil War?) But modern hacks would have writers keep all profanities out of it, re-write it so that nothing crude or insensitive made its way in.\n",
      "If you want lies, watch a Hollywood movie, read a trash novel; if you want genius, poetry, brilliant insights and literary talent, give \"Raintree County\" a try. Maybe, with enough of us protesting, the prude schoolmarms with tenure at universities will be nudged from their slumber and realize that they have neglected one of the titanic achievements of modern American literature.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This is a hard book to review: it will definitely not be everybody's cup of tea. I had started it once years before, then set it aside, and finally read it at a point in my life when I had the time and the patience. It is massive! But I've never read anything at all like it. It's about America and Americans, Time, Fantasy, the 19th Century, and lots more. Ultimately I found it to be a fascinating, provocative, and important work of American literature. At this point in time the 1957 MGM movie adaptation is more famous than the source novel. That's a pity. The movie is interesting in its own way, although its really not very good. And it barely begins to capture the scope of the novel; its plot follows the novel's outline in only the most cursory fashion. The novel RAINTREE COUNTY is a challenge, for its size if nothing else. But, for me, it remains one of those handful of books that crept into my psyche and changed what I thought a book should be.\n",

      "Remembering Mom Who Kept Us in Books\n",
      "\n",
      "As for this book, well, it started out good and took place in the 1800s, just before the Civil War. The history was interesting as was the main character’s philosophy on life. It has been said that it is America’s answer to “War and Peace.” So, while it wasn’t really boring, I just lost interest in it. And I was right about one thing, it is too thick. Maybe I will pick it up again someday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for my mom’s book shelf:\n",
      "My mother had this book in her bookcase since the late forties or 50s. She had once belonged to a book club, and that is where she obtained most of her older books. For some reason I always thought that they were Dad’s, and that she had taken them with her when they divorced. I asked my brother Bill about this, and he said that the John Steinbeck book set was given to him by Dad, and that he had put them in his suitcase when we left Dad. I imagine that the remainder of the books came to Mom later, along with our furniture. Either he or one of his brother’s must have brought them to us. Anyway, I just thought of her as reading the books that she had read when I was a teenager, like Earle Standly Gardner Frank Slaughter and romance novels.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a story behind Frank Slaughter who had been a lieutenant in the military. Mom had a letter that was once her mother’s, and a Lt. Frank Slaughter had written to her. He was in the military and wrote to her from a Red Cross Hospital, denying her charges of dishonesty. She had left him. Mom always wondered if they were the same man, so I tried to research it but came up with nothing. We will never know.\n",
      "\n",
      "My growing up years would sometimes be spent going through her books and reading what I liked. This one interested me because of its title and its light green cover with a dark green tree in the center. It was too thick for me to even thick to try to read. “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn” set next to it, but I never read it either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of her other books were children’s, except to say for the Steinbeck books that my brother Bill owns. Thenthere was a set of Feni Cooper’s. we don’t know what happened to Cooper’s, but he doesn’t recall owning them. I do. When he was a teenager, he read “The Grapes of Wrath,” asking our mom if what was written in it really happened. She said “Yes.” I read Steinbeck’s, “The Red Pony” and cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved a certain book whose name I wish I knew. It was a large encyclopedia that Mom may have received from a door-to-door salesman She used to read me a few nursery rhymes that were in it. I only remember this one:\n",

      "Bye baby Bunting,\n",

      "Bother’s gone to buy a skin,\n",
      "To wrap the baby Bunting in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The book came up missing, and I am the only one who remembers it. I used to drag it out and go through it. I only recall now that it had a color chart in it that told women what colors they would wear if they had blonde, brown or red hair. For example: Red haired women should not wear pink.\n",
      "\n",
      "The children’s books that she owned were bought for us, except that my older sister Jeanette had a set of Bobbsey Twins that my younger sister, Karen, now owns. And I have “The Secret in the Old Attic” by Carolyn Keene that was once Jeanette’s but belonged to her friend Alice young from Shandon, CA. Karen has the remainder of her books as she was the only one that wanted them after Mom died.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my dad’s mother’s books was in her collection. No one knows why unless Grandma gave it to her. Its title was\n",
      "“John Milton’s Complete Poetical Works.” Inscribed in it was Ggradmother’s name:\n",
      "“To Emma Lange from Hannah Toole, Feb. first, 1901, Chicago.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my mom was sentimental for she kept the books she had given to us when we were children, just like mothers often keep their child’s baby blanket. Mom did keep our younger brother’s blanket. I found it in a bag, tor in a bag. It was in tatters when I last saw it, as were some of the children’s books.\n",
      "\n",
      "She used to read to Jerry when he was small, and I remember that he knew one book by heart. If she missed a word in it, he would correct her even though he didn’t know how to read. I have a photo of him when he was around five years old. He is sitting on the floor looking through an encyclopedia. He now works at the Diablo Canyon Power Plant in San Luis Obispo, a big shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I look back on how she kept us in books, I am grateful. I can remember walking to the library with her and checking out books. I often went by myself. She and I once sat at the kitchen table and talked about the book she had on Bridey Murphey, wondering if reincarnation was true. She had also picked up “The Lost Books of the Bible” at the library, and we wondered where Cain got his wife. In later years she read The Reader’s Digest and even sent me a subscription to it after I was married. Some stories were interesting, like people being mauled by a bear, but I grew tired of the Digest, although I wish that I had studied the vocabulary words in i\n",

Raintree County is set in a mythical part of Indiana close to where I grew up, in Bloomington. The author, Ross Lockridge Jr. lived just down the street from my family. He was a young man. He was also a friend of our neighbor, Alfred Kinsey, for whom my mother, Mildred Hawksworth Lowell a Professor of Library Science at Indiana University, was librarian for Dr. Kinsey’s famous Human Sexuality Institute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon publication in 1947, Raintree County was an instantaneous best-seller leading shortly to a major studio contract for a movie starring Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift. One of the Lockridge children, young Ross, was my classmate in elementary school at Elm Heights Elementary. He would share the details of the movie process and, as I recall now more than 55 years later, being charmed by the famous players in the movie when the family visited the sets. I could only have been 7 or 8 at the time (born in 1946) but the magic of living in the midst of a famous novelist and the wonder of a Hollywood film are vibrant memories.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the peak of professional success, Mr. Lockridge committed suicide in a garage. I recall being dumbfounded as a child. “Why would he kill himself?” I asked my mother. “He had achieved so much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not exactly remember my mother’s response. But the question has lingered in my heart ever since. I have assumed the answer to be along the lines of – “Life is complex, son, even in the lap of glorious success one can become lost. Is this all there is for all of my work? Mr. Lockridge was a fine man. He must have had a torment that another cannot imagine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "From that time to this, I have always dreamed of being a writer. I have done non-fiction professional books for many years, and am only now into the fiction business. For some reason, the image of these questions has always crept into my mind when I have focused on the possibility of success as a fiction writer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What would it be like to succeed? What did Ross Lockridge Jr. feel when his first and only novel achieved instantaneous critical and financial success, followed by a major league movie contract? What would drive him to end his life?\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, I have moved from writing fiction manuscripts and putting them on the shelf to seeking a route to commercial publication. As I began this journey, I wanted to go back and see if I could answer these questions of a lifetime. First, I read the biography of Mr. Lockridge written by his son Larry, Shade of the Raintree. Then I picked up Raintree County itself, a tome of some 1,060 pages in the edition that was given to me as a birthday present by my sweetheart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raintree County is a masterpiece, obviously written in the hopes of becoming a Great American Novel. It traces the life and times of an absorbed young writer (John Wickcliff Shawnessy, a/k/a Johnny) from a rural county before, during, and after the Civil War. The central characters twist and turn through all of the pages as they age. The chronology of time switches back and forth, challenging the reader to keep all of the pieces in perspective. The characters include an elusive young lady whose nudity by the river and innocent frolic in a haystack reverberate through the story (Nell Gaither), a teacher and confessor (the Perfessor), a Southern belle who frolics with our hero one afternoon after too much cider and claims pregnancy, then becomes his first wife, an athletic arch-enemy who becomes a prosperous national businessman (Cash Carney), a competitor for the femme who becomes a U.S. Senator, and a cast of other characters that create the magic of the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Gone With the Wind, Ulysses, and other sweeping stories, one gets to the end (when Johnny comes marching home from the War) wondering what the point of the story is. Johnny began with the hope, aspiration, and innocence of youth, seeking answer to the riddle of the naked woman in the post office. In the end, Johnny seems to be seeking to find what he has lost along the way, perhaps the answer to the riddle.\n",
      "\n",
      "One can never know why this skilled author took his own life. Perhaps the answer is that he poured himself into this fascinating story that is so full of life, complete with its riddles, paradoxes, and mysteries, and lost his way in the process, finding himself unable to deal with the adulation that poured over him (or the frustration of dealing with publishers, agents, studios and the other characters in a story that he had not charted or, maybe, even contemplated). As Lockridge ended the story with Johnny’s determination that “each man had to build his world again [periodically:]!” It is difficult to return to the idealized world of the young, as Cash Carney laments in an epitath to lost youth (on page 848 of this edition).\n",
      "\n",
      "The thoughtful framework of Raintree County, the life of its author, and the biography of his son seem to cry for a re-telling of the story in another generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, Raintree County is the great American novel and should be back on reading lists. The essential issues and messages that are explored in these pages are present in the lives of each of us.\n",

      "I think I will start a bookshelf containing books that I know I will want to reread repeatedly throughout my life. The books on this shelf will be there because I've found that when I'm in a certain mood, only this book (or author sometimes) will do. It will place Gerard Manley Hopkins and Henry James next to Megan Whalen Turner and Robin McKinley with plenty of room for Dorothy Sayers. And Elizabeth Goudge will be there too. Sometimes what I like most about a book is the atmosphere it creates. What elements of a book constitute \"atmosphere\"? It's hard to pin down. It could be Rae in and her perfectly fried egg after a night of vampire-slaying in old flannel shirts. For Elizabeth Goudge, as for , I think it's at least partly a way of making houses and gardens and the people who occupy them beautifully infuse one another. I love reading these books because I would love to live in a house with a mantle piece made from bits of scroll-work from a grain ship that was driven aground in the marshes during a storm, causing a field of corn to grow in the marsh each spring a hundred years later. Some people would probably find this book preachy or find its morality old-fashioned. Maybe. But there's an honesty about the difficulty of what its asking that makes it solid to me. And both soothing and challenging.\n",
      "Review 2\n",

      "The year is 1947 or thereabouts. Britain has won the war, but at such a cost. Many men return from the war with physical and mental scars, trying to 'get on with their lives' but finding that the old roles no longer fit, that the world is still filled with the horrors of the camps, the refugees, the terrible new weapons, unspeakable things. The women, too, have borne burdens--waiting for news of sons and grandsons, fearing and sometimes hearing the worst, or trying to piece together marriages and menfolk torn in the aftermath. Ration books and food shortages are still the norm. In London, and even in the countryside, there are hardly any people who are free of dark memories.\n",
      "\n",
      "David Eliot is one of the survivors--once an actor, then a bomber pilot, now trying to rebuild a shattered career that seems pointless. His uncle, General George Eliot struggles at his desk job with the military and with a lonely marriage to a woman he loves desperately, but who has never loved him back. Nadine Eliot, George's wife, is tired, so tired, worn out by her five children, her loveless marriage, still holding onto the memory of the brief, unconsummated passion she and David shared for each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few whose souls remain whole. One is Sally Adair, daughter of a famous portrait artist. Sally spent the war years caring for sheep. Her innocence is like sunlight that filters gently, new-born each day, through the dense canopy of a centuries old beech wood. Then there are George and Nadine's children; each one, from the oldest teenage boys to the irrepressible five year old twins, is drawn as a completely believable individual, living in the now yet filled with promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "And at the center is the indomitable, autocratic, yet deeply loving Eliot matriarch, Lady Lucilla Eliot. Lucilla senses all the cross-currents, the private suffering of her children and grandchildren. It is Lucilla, now in her eighties, who draws together the innocent and the guilt-ridden, the whole and the wounded; maneuvering George, Nadine and their brood into abandoning their London life for a new start in an impossibly ancient pre-Tudor Pilgrim's Inn that becomes a source of unexpected healing and glorious discoveries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth Goudge writes like a dream. Her descriptions of the English countryside made me long to relocate--except that this world no longer exists. I am grateful that she captured the place and time so perfectly for us. Goudge is also gifted with the ability to shift effortlessly between multiple points of view, letting us empathize with complex characters, each flawed yet somehow special. And no one,, knows how to get inside the heads of children and teenagers of that era better than Elizabeth Goudge--especially when they are messing about in boats and playing Rat and Mole in .\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a book about healing, a book suffused with light and joy. And if my friends will forgive the of a Jew recommending a Christmas present, I'll say that this has the most perfect and moving Christmas-story ending since Charles Dickens.\n",

      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "”Increasingly, as she lived here, Nadine had a feeling that this house had a personality of its own - some sort of great angel who grew with the growth of the house and was enriched or otherwise, by those who lived here; and she felt, too, that this angel was well-disposed to her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The second of the Eliot Chronicles is about ‘The Herb of Grace’ - an ancient Pilgrim’s Inn which becomes the home of Nadine and George Eliot and their five children. In the first third of the book, it feels like this will be Nadine’s story: after the bitter loss of her great love, making this home will be the making of her family (and by extension, herself). But really this story is too well-populated and diffuse to be primarily about any one person. In addition to the Eliot family, with its various branches, other important characters are introduced: the artist John Adair and his daughter Sally, and the mysterious ‘troubadours’ Malony and Annie-Laurie, who arrive by houseboat and come to stay for a while at the inn.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house, or inn, is located on the edge of a great wood called the Knyghtwood - and the wood plays nearly as great a role in the story as the house does. Goudge is, at all time, aware of the power of nature and the healing role it plays in human lives. There is a great play between imagination and vision in the storyline and a conversation between David Eliot (the actor) and Sally gives a sense of the spiritual component that is such an integral part of this story:\n",
      "\n",
      "The inn’s past - as a gathering place for pilgrims; as a shelter for wounded bodies and spirits, both human and animal - is revealed through a combination of seeking and the happy accident of curiosity. The twins, youngest of Nadine and George’s children and strangely feral, discover both the hidden centre of the wood and the hidden centre of the house - and both places form a focal point for creative and emotional healing for various of the story’s characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the characters in this story are haunted by the past and cannot quite let go from their buried shame and pain. Additionally, the book is set just at the end of World War II, and there is that sense of desolation and world-weariness. ‘The herb of grace’ is rue: astringent, symbolising repentance, representing the single mindedness of the pilgrim. It’s compassion for each other that allows the sufferers in this book to accept the blessings of the inn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although what I’ve written makes the book sound a bit dour, it isn’t that at all. Goudge writes of the most serious of things with a very light touch that gives a touch of the fairy story to all of her tales. The book begins in spring and ends in winter, but both seasons offer a different kind of hopefulness to the lives within the story. And the reader cannot help but be touched, too.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I usually read this book at Christmas. I love it so much that I bought several used copies (it is an old book) and distributed them. I don't know why - but the messages of this book bring peace to my soul - as it should, as the book is about inner peace and living and making choices for the right reasons. The end of the book has a great Christmas sequence. The book takes place right after WWII which apeals to me not only because my parents were young then, but it describes well what we feel about what is happening in the world today. I have probably read this book 5-6 times over 20 years.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Extraordinary fiction. If you haven't read Goudge yet, you need to start with this trilogy. No fluffy romance here. Real people with real problems and no simple solutions. Yet the outcome is satisfying.\n",

      "There was a thing in the first half of the 20th century (and a bit) for Christian religious films coming out of Hollywood - King of Kings, Ben Hur, The Ten Commandments, The Robe, Lilies of the Field. Novels were also part of the deluge. This was another of Douglas’s books which, like The Robe, became a bestseller. This time it’s the story of Peter the apostle who fished the Sea of Galilee. I think what I enjoyed about Douglas’s writing is that he made biblical characters look and act like real people I would meet once I walked out my door. You do not have to be religious to get into his books. You just have to like historical fiction.\n",

      "\n",
      "Of the two protagonists, Fara has the more adventurous life. At age twelve, she swore to avenge her mother’s honor, and when her mother dies young of a mysterious illness four years later, the girl takes off for Judaea, disguised as a boy for her safety, aiming to assassinate her faithless father. Near the start of her quest, she runs into John the Baptist, finding him sympathetic and inspiring but frightened by his vision of the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is followed after several months by her boyfriend, Voldi, who becomes friends with the Roman Mencius (who also appears in ) and both become embroiled in the events of Passion Week, but neither to the same extent as Peter or Fara.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter, born Simon, is just a fisherman of Capernaum with little education and no use for religion. He hears of an itinerant preacher with apparently magical healing powers from his young friend John, son of Zebedee. Annoyed that someone has taken John’s attention away from his job fishing, Peter storms off to one of Jesus’ sermons, and witnesses the Man of Galilee give eyesight to a toddler who was clearly blind before. His whole worldview shaken, Simon spends the next several weeks irritable and depressed. Meanwhile, Fara, under the alias Esther, seeks refuge in Simon’s mother-in-law’s house, and gets a day job as a maid at Antipas’ palace, where she hopes to eventually carry out her oath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Jesus calls Simon to follow him, and the miserable man only feels right in the presence of the Carpenter, so he obeys Him. His brother Andrew and his friends James and John soon join them. As Jesus travels across the country, trailing miracles in His wake, His following swells. After Jesus heals Simon’s mother-in-law with Fara as witness, He convinces her to follow Him, and she does.\n",
      "We witness the dance of Salome and the execution of John the Baptist (all handled with the utmost discretion); the Feeding of the Five Thousand (which diverges a bit from Scripture, but nothing really alarming); the raising of Jairus’ daughter; the Last Supper; the sham trial, torture, and execution of Jesus; the Resurrection; the meeting on the road to Emmaus; the Ascension; the Pentecost; and finally the events immediately leading up to Peter’s execution in Rome.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are fleeting references throughout to Marcellus, Senator Gallio, Demetrius, and other characters from , which was fun. Mencius is an important supporting character in both.\n",
      "\n",
      "is not quite as good as its predecessor—it feels rushed in parts, and Voldi’s arc is a lot more melodramatic than anything in . This book is also a bit more didactic in the religious department, which might have been inevitable since Jesus is actually a character this time, rather than a permeating invisible presence. But was a sky-high bar to clear, and I can forgive Douglas if he can’t quite vault it this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The character development for Simon/Peter is obviously quite good; he seems ready to step off the page by the end. Fara/Esther is not quite as developed, but she has spirit and gives up everything for her beliefs and the safety of her loved ones, making her a truly heroic character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Douglas’ Jesus is very gentle, gracious, and wise. The book makes a point of contrasting Him with His spitfire cousin John, a ploy which unfortunately makes His outburst at the money-changers in the Temple seem far out-of-character, but overall is quite effective. Douglas also makes a point of showing Jesus doing His day job—He was a carpenter, remember?—and doing it exceptionally well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish as a Catholic that Douglas could have made the Virgin Mary part of the story. It is strange that Esther was a female disciple but never met either her or Magdalene. Oh well. Douglas was a Protestant, so his avoidance of the subject is understandable.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book seemed to play loosely with history at times (for instance, Herod Antipas died in exile but was probably not assassinated as shown here) but a story set this far back in time, with so few complete records of anything, has a lot more wiggle-room in this regard than something from the Renaissance onwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The violence (except for the Passions of the Baptist and Jesus, neither of which is gorily portrayed) is nonexistent, the sex (just some insinuations regarding Herodias, Herod, and Salome) is also nonexistent, and there’s only the mildest of language and drunkenness. It would make a fine addition to the library at your church or upper-grade parochial school.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would also make a fine addition to your home library.\n",

      "Lloyd C Douglas is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. This is the second of his books that I have read and I would gladly pick up another. He's full of detail and history, without overwhelming you with his vast research. He makes historical and biblical characters real, full of emotions, anger, frustration, doubt, fear, yearnings, hopes...all the things that they likely dealt with but we don't give them when we pick up a history book. He's able to weave in the political and historical complexities of the time, giving more credence to the choices we know these people made, yet he does it without detracting from the story he's telling. I find myself immersed in his world, and then thinking about it when I put the book down. I love it when a fiction book is an enjoyable read, but sticks with me in positive ways after I'm done.\n",

      "I loved this book. Published in 1947, and contemporary at the time, at this point it almost qualifies as a historical novel. Charley Gray, a hard-working assistant vice-president at a small but tony New York bank, is twisting in the wind waiting for news about whether he, or a presumed rival, will be tapped for a vacant vice presidency. We spend a day in Charley's life, and then flash back to his coming of age in, and ultimately leaving, a tradition-bound small Massachusetts town in the wake of traumatic personal events. Marquand's touch in describing the structures of small-town life, prejudices, and social structure is wonderful, and his accounting of Charley's life in the New York world of finance and family is perfect.\n",
      "Charley is a thoughtful and sympathetic protagonist; we like him, admire him and want him to succeed. He's bound in social chains that are hard to break, but he behaves himself and doesn't give up. His observations are acute. Plus, he went to Dartmouth. What's not to like? (Never mind that every one in the hierarchies Charley comes in contact with loses no opportunity to disparage Dartmouth.) One could wish at times he acted more decisively on his judgements, but if he did, there wouldn't be any story to tell.\n",

      "Annoyed by the amused detachment of the observers in When Prophecy Fails and Doomsday Cult? Strike back by reading this: Charles Gray has a solid job in a solid bank in New York in the solid post-war years, being passively pushed forward by his ambitious wife, when he has a chance encounter with a sociologist who conducted a study of his Massachusetts home town circa 1925.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he reads the resulting book 'Yankee Persepolis', we're drawn into the inner narrative - Charles' memories of those days, how he grew up and how he came to leave. And the outer story is resolved in a daring and surprising way.\n",

      "How come nobody remembers J.P. Marquand anymore ? At his best, he produced some of 20th century America's great fiction. POINT OF NO RETURN is perhaps his greatest novel and surely one of the \"great American novels\", up there with \"An American Tragedy\" by Dreiser, Warren's \"All the King's Men\", and Norris' \"McTeague\" Lewis' \"Dodsworth\", and several by Faulkner. It is quieter, it takes its time, and there are no dreadful family secrets, no violence, sex, or perversions of any kind. In short, it is a novel of another era, but a great novel nonetheless.\n",
      "It seems to me that two opposing tendencies have always occupied American culture. One is quite puritanical, centered more in New England and Philadelphia, concerned with moderation, education, hard work, and success to those who deserve it. The Old North Church in Boston, where our nation can be said to have begun, typifies this tendency. In what other nation is the historical heart so simple and plain ? The other tendency, found in many places, but epitomized today in Las Vegas and a certain president, is about luck, flash and vulgar display, raw opportunism and the willingness to pull whatever tricks it takes.\n",
      "In POINT OF NO RETURN, Marquand takes an officer in a genteel Manhattan bank who hopes to be promoted to vice-president. He has a rival, somebody a bit more flashy, more willing to utter subtle put-downs behind his back. The officer, Charles Gray, hails from Newburyport, Mass., but has married and made his career elsewhere. He is sent back to his old hometown suddenly on bank business. The majority of the book is devoted to his memories of how he grew up in this small New England city on a river by the sea. Marquand contrasts the sober, hard-working, reliable Charles with his father, a likeable neer-do-well who gambled everything he could get his hands on in the stock market. The family is shown in the context of a conservative small town where \"everything is in its place and there's a place for everything.\" The painstaking detail, the nuances of small town New England life, the nature, the passing of the seasons, the varieties of people found in such an environment are what make this such a great novel. If Charles Gray is not such a vivid character as those found on the pages of Balzac, Zola, or Faulkner, that may be the point. Charles romances the daughter of an `old money' family, but it is not to be. Class and tradition, as well as the vagaries of history and his own father's insouciance block him. He leaves his Boston job and goes to work in New York, where he meets his wife. When he returns to New York from his short trip to the past, he despairs. His rival will surely triumph. Charles and his wife are invited to the bank president's mansion by the sea. The ending is perfect. That is, it perfectly reflects Marquand's view that America became great because of its ability to produce people like Charles Gray--steady, reliable, intelligent, and willing to be a team player.\n",
      "Marquand no doubt admired such people, perhaps a little too much. One of the strong characters in POINT OF NO RETURN is an anthropologist, Malcolm Bryant, who comes to do a social survey of Newburyport (called \"Clyde\" in the novel). Marquand paints him as a grotesque, unpleasant man with no social skills who treats the townspeople like insects. Bryant is based on the character of F. Lloyd Warner, an anthropologist who indeed carried out a social study of Newburyport in the 1920s. Throughout, Marquand displays an almost Antipodean dislike of intellectuals and academics, yet his own work is close to modern anthropology. That is probably why I like it so much. He has described the roots and origins of a solid class of businessmen; how they avoided the temptations of speculation and opportunism on one hand, and prevailed over the too-tight restrictions of class on the other. He shows how certain New England values and styles permeated east coast institutions in the first half of the 20th century. Though business is hardly the only occupation of a large country, America owes a lot to those generations who produced great numbers of people willing to labor for years to build solid industries and financial institutions. POINT OF NO RETURN is a slow, lyrical study of a life and career which may illustrate the whole society of the time. I consider it a classic. When I looked around ten years ago and saw Enron, sub-prime mortgage disasters, and 24 year-old arms dealers with government contracts worth hundreds of millions for defective ammunition, I despaired. I fear the country has gone to the dogs. Where are our Charles Grays ? Woof woof.\n",

      "To my mind I am beginning to seriously consider the notion that John O'Hara is the American mid-20th century equivalent to Britain's Anthony Trollope of the 19th century. O'Hara was a prolific writer of short-stories, novellas, and novels from the late-1920s up until his death in 1970. He was incredibly adept at portraying all walks of life in the Pennsylvania coal country that he grew up in, or the streets and nightclubs of New York City, as well as on the film lots and studios of Hollywood. His real skill though, is his ability to describe and characterize the relationships between men and women.\n",
      "\n",
      "O'Hara's , first published in 1949, is the story of the life of Grace Caldwell Tate. Grace is a woman of great wealth and great beauty, with an incredibly strong connection to the Pennsylvania Dutch landscape where she has lived her entire life. Not to put too fine a point on it, Grace likes sex, and this butts directly up against the rules that society places on the behavior of women in her day and time. There are consequences associated with Grace's choices and actions, and these consequences affect many of the citizens of the little town of Fort Penn where Grace lives with her husband Sidney Tate, and their three children.\n",
      "\n",
      "is an enthralling portrait of small-town America just before, during, and following the First World War. This historical view of early 20th century Pennsylvania, as seen through the eyes of Grace and Sidney, was fascinating for me. O'Hara deftly describes the days of horses and wagons yielding to Model-T's, Ford Coupes, and Pierce Arrows; the patriotic fervor and fear of the on-coming World War in Europe; terrible diseases like influenza and \"infantile paralysis\" (i.e., polio myelitus) that indiscriminately strike rich and poor and old and young; the 'party-line' telephone system; and even the the arcane goings on at the local cocktail and dinner parties. There is even a brief little vignette where an older and mature Grace Caldwell Tate meets and chats up the young 17 or 18-year-old Julian English, long before he has married the pretty Caroline Walker, bought his Cadillac dealership, and later when at a party on a cold Christmas Eve--in a fit of pique--throws his highball and ice into the face of Harry Reilly, precipitating the events characterized in O'Hara's most famous novel, (1934).\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a hell of a good book that kept me turning one page after the other. I know that some reviewers have complained that it was too long, but I respectfully disagree, it was just right. In a sense this novel is the of Grace Caldwell, and it just wouldn't have made sense to only partially know Grace. No, the reader needs to know all of Grace, in order to better understand her \"Rage to Live.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This novel is John O'Hara's 'A Portrait of a Lady'--Grace Caldwell Tate-and it merits 4.5 stars out of 5, and ends up being a truly classic work of modern American literature; and a novel that I guarantee you that I look forward to rereading again in the future.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Interesting period piece information. 700+ pages. Whew. The title \"A Rage to Live\" gave me the impression it would be more intense. Instead, its kind of like a PG-13 Philadelphia Story. Not normally my type of book, but interesting writing style. Sometimes the author would spend 2 pages describing each and every person, say invited to a party, whether or not they were characters later in the book - it would go on and on and on, often making me want to skip to the end of the page. But then something major happens - a main character dies - and it's like the author lost steam, and such an important event begins and ends in the same paragraph, bringing me back to try to focus on EVERY paragraph, so I don't miss a major plot turn. It was odd, having every single food item from a buffet listed in great detail, pages, where you could almost taste the dishes, then the suffering of someone dying - is done and gone with before you know it, and you don't have a chance to feel it. I felt I knew the buffet dinner more than I knew the dying mans pain. A good book to read when you're sick in bed and need something you can pick up and read. Easy to put down, and easy to pick up.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Before I started reading John O'Hara novels about six months ago, I didn't know much about the state of Pennsylvania but that is no longer the case. What I did know, had to do with my studying of the Revolutionary War period and the US Constitution. And now with the election of President Elect Joseph Biden I am becoming somewhat of an expert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A Rage to Live,\" like previous novels by Mr. O'Hara takes place during the turn of the century and just before World War 1 and a few decades after. At a time when the state of Pennsylvania, and rich areas like the city of Fort Penn, were experiencing a new wave of immigration. Previously, the population was mainly Dutch and German, and with the new wave they suddenly started seeing more Italians, Irish, and Jews.\n",
      "\n",
      "The novel follows the life of one Mrs. Grace Tate, previously Grace Caldwell, and like so many female characters written about by Mr. O'Hara, she is one unforgettable character. Born rich into the super wealthy and the powerful Caldwell family, and marrying rich, she is one for breaking norms, sexual norms like cheating on her husband in the back seat of an automobile, and after his death having affairs with married men, and not just wanting to have sex but coming away satisfied and fulfilled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Grace Tate is not in any way to be considered a 'loose woman.' She is an independent lady and her sexuality is normal, even if her choice of men might not be the wisest. This is a long novel, over six hundred pages, and at times it did get dull, but overall it is a superbly written... At times an electrifying narrative, and simply proves, once again, that John O'Hara was one of the great American writers of the 20th century.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Ah, such excruciating detail on the small-town elite of imagined Fort Allen, PA! O'Hara deserves credit for this detailed setting, and I was surprised for the matter-of-fact and fairly explicit sex scenes of an early 60s book. Was O'Hara ahead of his time? Did the work get banned here and there?\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought from the movie Grace would be an unbridled nymphomaniac, more just someone that seemed damaged in a way and gave in to the expectation that she would \"put out\"... She seemed slightly tragic, her husband Sidney dying of a broken heart lamely so, and Richard Bannon like Greek tragedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought the ending with documentary-style where-are-they-now of the key dramatis personae was weak and the book overlong and slow.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "His Appointment in Samarra is just wonderful and he's credited with being one of the great short story writers of the 20th century, but O'Hara is simply dreadful here. I was astonished at how dull it is. There's something dispiriting about an obviously talented writer writing badly. O'Hara thought of A Rage to Live as his magnum opus, a grand social novel, but his envy and resentment towards the upper crust Pennsylvanians among whom he grew up leads to something like fetishism here. O'Hara cannot help but tell us every item on the menu at a society wedding, itemize every gift, tell us where it was purchased and at what cost, go into a lengthy analysis of how one's service at the local barber shop is determined by which country club one belongs to and why...I could go on and on. One keeps hoping O'Hara's incessant chronicling and categorizing of the banal will blossom into a story, but by page 255 (to be exact) I gave up. Oh, dear, what a very bad book.\n",

      "Народ все в конце концов узнает, пусть даже никто ему ничего не сообщает, сначала он чувствует это смутно, словно во сне, но однажды молниеносно прозревает, и тогда начинаются всякие перемены, затеваются драки на перекрестках, поджигаются дома, и очень многое меняется.\n",
      "Сказать, что книжные рекомендации Анастасии Завозовой всегда заходят на ура, было бы преувеличением, но если случается совпасть, то совпадение бывает полным, как с этим романом.\n",

      "Мика Валтари писал свой роман, опираясь на \"Сказание Синухе\" - один из древнейших литературных памятников человечества, который датируют двухтысячным годом до Нашей Эры, представляете, какая древность? Хотя события романа перенесены в более поздний период начала-середины XIV в. до Н.Э.. но изящные отсылки к истории первого Синухе во множестве встречаются в книге.\n",
      "\n",
      "Почему более поздний период? Потому что драматургия и культ селебрити рулят: имена Эхнатона, Нефертити и Тутанхамона не пустой звук для абсолютного большинства. Потому что это дало возможность рассказать не только о Египте, но и о сопредельных странах, где к тому времени уже существовали развитые и переживающие упадок цивилизации: Вавилон, Крит, Хеттское царство, Сирия. Да просто потому что. Он это сделал, и сделал превосходно.\n",

      "Роман состоит из пятнадцати частей (свитков), каждая из которых отражает события определенного жизненного периода героя. Рассказ ведется от первого лица, это исповедальная проза, довольно психологически глубокая и беспощадная к себе. Одновременно масштабная социальная проза, изящно стилизованный исторический роман, авантюрный, военный, шпионский, любовный и роман взросления. Что, прямо вот так все в одном флаконе и никто не уйдет обиженным? Именно.\n",

Экзотика исторического антуража и сменяющих друг друга в странствиях героя древних царств, не заслоняет истории его жизни.\n",

Вот бездетная супруга врача в квартале бедноты вылавливает маленькую тростниковую лодочку с лежащим в ней младенцем (салют, Моисей), вот мальчик учится и учение дается ему на диво легко, хотя в драках и мальчишеских забавах, требующих силы и ловкости, он не из первых.\n",

      "The Delaney siblings are unconventional to say the least. They are two non-blood related siblings by way of the marriage of a famous musician father and a celebrity woman dancer mother, who gain a half-sister, Celia. Years later we join all three of them, grown up, sitting in the family home of the married older half-sister Maria, and looking back on their highly unconventional past that saw the two older non-blood related siblings attain creative heights. Maria's husband decries all three of them as parasites before exiting, leaving them to share their pasts with one another, themselves and... us readers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when reading this in 2021, this could be deemed a contemporary piece of work, but really The Parasites defies an exact classification, with its multi-layered breakdown of this celebrity hybrid family, a family of mostly unlikable, but tremendously gifted individuals who seemingly born with their gifts, have never really worked that hard to get something, or indeed at any personal relationship! Looked through a 1940s lens it's a damning character study of some of the creative elite, especially when biography reading indicates that this work has auto biographical insights with the father of the family somewhat based on Daphne's own father!\n",
      "\n",
      "Cuttingly psychological at times, and darkly comedic in other moments, this is not part of the high-drama Cornish historical sagas of Daphne du Maurier's main body of work, but in a way, that is what it all the more compelling and interesting! Looked through a 2021 lens it could also be seen as character study of privilege. 7.5 out of 12, although I can already tell a reread will see me giving this book more love!\n",

      "This has some brilliant ideas and contains scads of wisdom about the pitfalls and the rewards of a creative life. Three siblings whose parents were Pappy, a famous singer, and Mama, a brilliant dancer, spend an afternoon remembering their childhood and decisions they have made.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are brought to this circumspection because Maria's husband has just called them 3 parasites. Maria and Niall and Celia (in that birth order) have always been inseparable since they were children and traveled around with their parents in a bohemian style from theater to hotel all around the world.\n",
      "At first I was in disagreement with Charles, but I can see how he did suffer with a wife who was a brilliant stage actor. Of the 3 siblings, Maria was the most self-centered, but she had her art and it was her whole life. Probably, she should never have married and had children, because she ignored both. Niall was a world famous popular song writer and Celia did gorgeous drawings, but loved helping people more than her art, so she truly wasn't parasitic, unless the author is saying that some people are cloying in their need to take care of others?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is very sad, but there is also humor in the book, in this section duMaurier is describing Niall's driving:\n",
      "\n",
      "Always an indifferent driver . . .Niall became worse through the years, because he became progressively more vague. . . He shot traffic lights, not with intention, but because momentarily he would confuse green with red; or alternatively he would stay waiting, overtime, when the colours changed, so that only the infuriated hooting of drivers in the rear,. . .would startle him from a temporary dream into instant, and often fatal, action.\n",

      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The problem with the book is that these three siblings aren't parasites, they're trash. Well, that's not exact. Two of them are garbage people, the third is a self-denying loser. Parasites only take and these three actually do a lot of giving. Two are symbiotes: a brother who is a writer of catchy tunes and a sister who is a famous stage actress, creepily dependent on each other, both literally giving the world pleasure with their talents. A third sacrifices her entire life to serve others, especially her father. I suppose du Maurier was trying to say that superficial rich artists full of angsty white fragility who don't have healthy relationships with other people are... parasites? Um, no. So many other words can be used. To be kind, I will just say that these three are Sad with a capital S, but certainly not parasitical. Anyway, for such an exact and exacting author, the misuse of that word is strange and disappointing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately the book itself is a mainly absorbing experience. du Maurier is a superb writer: her characters dense with inchoate ambitions and inarticulated emotions, her prose all the shades of gray but somehow still entirely vivid, scenes carefully set and dripping with atmosphere and detail, small tragedies and big moments all delivered with subtlety and finesse, and she serves up the whole bitter feast with such marvelously dry detachment. In general, du Maurier does leave me cold - possibly because she has ice running through her veins - but her skills are entirely admirable.\n",
      "\n",
      "For much of the novel, the narrative switches back and forth in time, portraying the present when the siblings are shattered and ruminative after being called parasites by the husband of one (c'mon, get a grip everyone) and also portraying the past, mainly their lives as the children of two fey artists with rampant egos, growing up all around the world in various luxurious hotels and rentals. These narratives are in alternating chapters. Honestly, I found myself rushing through the chapters set in the present because they were so full of navel-gazing, while the chapters set in the past are dazzlingly vital. What lives these kids had!\n",
      "\n",
      "Although du Maurier is far from generous with her characters, she paints a picture of a lifestyle that is both completely alien to me and completely real. Their hopes and dreams, the whirlwind of locations, the eccentric characters coming in and out of their world, their relationships with each other and their parents - I wish the whole book was set in this enchanting past. Unfortunately, the more we stayed in the present, the more moralistic the book became, and so it also became rather stultifying. I'm not interested in the grown-up lives of an unloving mother, her brother the self-absorbed twit, and her sister the tedious doormat. That said, the most lively chapter occurs late, when these so-called parasites and their plus ones are invited to a weekend at a country manor, and turn the whole thing into a humiliating debacle for everyone. Old Money should never invite self-centered artistes over for the weekend, hopefully lesson learned. Stay in your lane, Old Money; those types will only mortify everyone's delicate sensibilities, including the staff.\n",

I could tell from the first chapter that this was not like her typical story; no mystery or sense of building dread, no suspense. Okay, that's fine, I can deal with an author going in a different direction, even applaud the courage it takes.

They were always a unit of 3, so close and weird that the reader was never sure who was narrating the story. I lost interest at the midway point and sped read the final 30%. Even the two chapters that were supposed to be humorous horrified me by the characters total self-absorption.\n",

      "In the Warsaw Ghetto there was an underground group of archivists known as the Oyneg Shabbes. Their function was to chronicle the Nazi atrocities for posterity. These journals were famously buried in parts of the ghetto. Some were later discovered; others weren't. John Hersey writes this novel in the form of one of these fictitious journals. He reports the conversations he has with a group of disparate characters, including a Jewish Policeman, members of the Jewish council, smugglers, Gestapo informers and fighters. It's a form that allows him to load the book with information, cram in as much of his research as possible - in other words it gives him the overview scope of a non-fiction book. What's lost in this process is dramatic tension. The individual characters are dwarfed by all the historical information. Also, various genuine journals have survived so why write or read a fictitious one? If historical novels are to provide us with an experience that eludes non-fiction books, it's critical they press us up much more closely to the events described through an empathy with the central characters. In many ways The Wall is the novelist playing safe - he is admitting his own limitations by cocooning himself in a bunker and relying on other voices to tell him what happened. For me he could have been imaginatively braver; he could have embraced the spirit of fiction more daringly instead of submitting so conscientiously to chronicling facts. Fiction at its best transcends fact. (Lauren Binet playfully examined the fact vs fiction conflict so brilliantly in his novel HHhH.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I recently read a real journal of the Ghetto which got me interested in the subject and one of the fascinating things about it was the profusion of untrue rumour or, in modern parlance, fake news. Fake news abounded in the ghetto where virtually all contact with the outside world was cut off. The populace was made all the more insecure by not having a clue what to believe and what to disbelieve. Intelligence deteriorated into ignorance and ignorance is the first step to mindlessness, to dehumanisation. Hersey has the hindsight to correct all the fake news. So, most of what he writes is uncannily true - except, conversely, it wasn't true in spirit because often he was giving his archivist his own hindsight. What this means, is this novel occupies a kind of hinterland between fiction and non-fiction - but again without the irony Binet masters in HHhH.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I said, the form of the novel, reported conversations with his cast of characters, might allow him to load the novel with information from different perspectives but it doesn't favour dramatic tension. Never is this more apparent than during the uprising itself, perhaps the most difficult of all ghetto events to imagine, and this is the weakest part of the novel - probably because it's also the hardest part of the true story to research. Most participants died, survivors only experienced the fight against the Nazis in a piecemeal fashion. The most baffling aspect of the uprising was how so few individuals completely untrained in handling weapons managed to hold out longer against the Germans than the entire Polish nation. You can't help wondering why the Nazis fled so easily. It's hard to believe many were killed by individuals firing a loaded weapon with so little ammunition for the first time in their lives from great distances. Without wanting to belittle the achievements of the Jewish fighters in any way you have to assume that the SS regiments engaged in the ghetto fighting, unlike the Wehrmacht, were a cowardly bunch. Typical bullies in other words. They didn't like being shot at.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a lot of wisdom in this novel and, despite its flaws, it does give a comprehensive picture of what life in the Warsaw Ghetto entailed so I'd recommend it if you're interested in the subject matter. I'd also recommend it to lovers of dystopian fiction as the Warsaw Ghetto might serve as the archetypal end of time experience for anyone who lived there.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I am not surprised if you have not heard of this book, but please, please read it. It's one of the most incredible pieces of literature I have ever picked up. It is the archives of a man named Noach Levinson who lived through the Warsaw ghetto and chronicled in minute detail his experiences and the lives of those around him. It is both fascinating and terribly heartbreaking to see the way in which the Jews in Warsaw were systematically destroyed through the eyes of one of their own. I have never read a book on the subject that even comes close to the depth of knowledge and feeling in The Wall.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Brilliantly written ... the part I've read so far forces the reader to feel the relentless closing of the ghetto\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The story told in The Wall by John Hersey is very similar to the story that Leon Uris related in Mila 18. The Wall came first, published in 1950, with Mila 18 being published in 1961. Both describe the Jewish resistance in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1943. I read Mila 18 many years go and remember being very much moved by it. Unfortunately, other than being able to say I found both novels very emotionally impactful, my memories of Mila 18 are too dim to compare the two. I looked for some comparative analyses but could not find much of anything. Both novels appear to have been well regarded by critics. Mila 18 is much more widely read and popular on Goodreads; that may be due to the greater popularity of Leon Uris or the timing of Mila 18 following closely after Uris’ success with Exodus.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found The Wall very well written. I enjoyed the structure of the novel: at the beginning a fictional editor tells the reader that the story has been pieced together from journals kept by Noach Levinson and buried in the Ghetto during the war. In the novel Noach Levinson was a member of the Jewish community and eventually joined the resistance. The journals were dug up after the war. Being presented in this manner as factual reporting created for me a strong intimacy with the story and characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story revolves around a group of families who at the beginning of the novel are co-located in a particular apartment house. The families look to Dolek Berson and Rachel Apt for strength and leadership. As the Germans use the entrapment of the Ghetto to funnel the Jews toward their “final solution”, the inhabitants inside the wall fight for their survival in ways that often reflect the personalities of the individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pulled deeply into the story and found myself strongly attached to many of the characters. I even observed myself working to understand and sympathize with those whose behavior I did not admire, because we never know how we might react when faced with stress and fear. This novel is long, almost 600 pages, but I never felt that it should have been shorter. Highly recommended.\n",

      "Author John Hersey was a Pulitzer Prize winning writer, best known for his small first person account of the aftermath of the bombing of Hiroshima, called Hiroshima.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when he writes historical fiction, as he does in The Wall, it is very close to actual events. Based on the real documents found buried inside the destroyed Jewish ghetto of Warsaw after WWII ended, it tells the story of the Jews who were trapped there by the Nazis who took over Poland in 1939, and the escalating determination to wipe out these people by their oppressors.\n",
      "\n",
      "But The Wall also is about, not just destruction, but a determination to survive under the most harrowing of conditions. Hersey writes this novel as if it were the journals of one of the characters. He observes and reports on the events of the community...from the trivial to the momentous. He also documents the noose tightening around the community as the years of the war go by, and the Nazi determination to destroy all Jews grew ever stronger.\n",
      "\n",
      "At times the book is utterly heart-breaking. Tears were in my eyes as the underground fighters had to kill a baby to keep its cries from leading the Nazis to their hiding place, which would have been death for all of them. And yet...somehow Hersey is able to write into this always an underlying hope...a ray of life...a value that while there is life, there is still hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the events that Hersey fictionalizes here actually happened, or events very close to them did. That he able to humanize these horrible atrocities, that he is able to individualize this mass destruction, is a gift of a master storyteller and journalist.\n",

      "I'm one of those \"old-school\" Catholics: a young teenager when Vatican II brought the Church into the 20th century, yet having had enough of the Tridentine experience during my formative years to leave a lasting impression of Church as an integral part of Self. Great books and films, over the years, reinforced my early memories: The Ten Commandments; Ben-Hur; Quo Vadis; The Shoes of the Fisherman; The Nun's Story; even such light-hearted fare as Going My Way and The Bells of St. Mary's reinforced, in a Legion-of-Decency-kind-of-way, the notion of strength that is rooted in Faith and Patriotism. These films about Faith left no room for doubt: Our faith was core of who we were/are, the very extension of ourselves. I spent as much time in Catholic middle school assisting at Mass as I did helping with chores at home, and it was at least an annual event to help out at the rectory or the convent with fall or spring cleaning. So when I recently found, tucked in the corner of an upstairs bookcase, a paperback copy - 75 cents, it had cost, when it was purchased in 1963, mind you! - of Henry Morton Robinson's THE CARDINAL, I had to read it. Sure, I've seen the film more than a few times, with Tom Tryon in the lead role as Stephen Fermoyle, and it's always struck me as powerful. But here was the book, and I knew, as ultimately turns out to be the case, there had to be more to the story than Hollywood's version. I could not have been more right - or more satisfied with the read.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE CARDINAL, while one novel, has six parts to it, plus a Prologue and an Epilogue. This made for convenience, as I've been busy reading several things simultaneously. I was able to put Robinson and Fermoyle aside and return later, picking up effortlessly where I left off. As for the six parts, each focuses on a time in Stephen Fermoyle's life: as young Rome-educated, American priest - Boston/Medford, to be precise - then as a curate, a bureaucrat, a monsignor, bishop/archbishop, and, finally, as a cardinal, a member of the Sacred College, and advisor to the pope. Each part is intense and satisfying in a way I wasn't prepared for. It seems to me, Fermoyle's life and experiences are based in part on that of Francis Spellman, a Boston priest who eventually became the Archbishop of New York, a formidable cleric during the mid-twnetieth century.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than just a great read, THE CARDINAL is a timely one, particularly during this election season and at a time when we, as a nation, appear to have lost our clarity of vision around the separation of Church and State. Stephen Fermoyle, faced several times with accusations of institutional loyalty, is absolutely clear about decisions made as a son of the Church as opposed to those made as an American citizen. It's refreshingly black-and-white! There are other issues as well that seem all-too-familiar: abortion and Planned Parenthood, the threat of war, but - and interestingly - not the questioning of authority or the questionable behavior of clerics. It is a different time, and yet, it's not.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sure most will be content to leave this one in the corner. I'm putting it back with an elastic around its middle as it separated, due to old age, during the reading. For those willing to take a chance and blow the dust off, I think you'll find it a rich and satisfying read. It's strong on substance and plot, has powerful, if somewhat forgotten, themes, and an ending that evokes hope. I'm glad I took the time... (less)\n",

      "When Hemingway wrote this novel, he may have known that his masterpieces were behind him. Although this novel is a lesser work, there are moments of tenderness, poignancy and power crafted in his trademark miminalist style that linger. The novel concerns a retired Army Colonel, who has fought in brutal combat, near the end of his life and is desperately in love with a much younger woman. To me the woman signified the Colonel's lost youth and the relationship may take on new meaning if one views it as such. The Colonel looks backward in the novel to the horror and futility of war, which serves as a contrast to the extreme tenderness of his last love affair in Venice. Hemingway's experiences during the Spanish Civil War and in Paris during World War II give him much to draw upon in this literary \"moveable feast,\" which soubriquet first appears here. Against the harshness of his existence the Colonel has retreated to Italian duck blinds, Venice in winter and the adoring young beauty of his life. One senses that at this time in his life, so near the end, that Hemingway sees his own life's lapse into finality in lines from Stonewall Jackson's dying moments to cross peacefully over the river and into the trees. Hemingway is a master of dialogue and there is much between the Colonel and his young mistress to savor. I recommend that you read Old Man and the Sea, A Farewell to Arms and/or For Whom the Bell Tolls before taking on this novel. If you admire and have widely read Hemingway already, then this is a very fine but not great novel relative to his masterpieces. This is a compelling, accessible novel which subtleties will linger and perhaps the greatest aspect of the genius of his craft is that he never fails to have this same powerful impact.\n",

      "There are two principle characters in this novel - Colonel Richard Cantwell and his lover Renata. He is fifty-one. She is nineteen. He is masculine. He is brusque, downright rude, and could quite simply be viewed as a bastard. But is he? Well, I like him. You see Hemingway goes beneath the surface of what is immediately visible and gives you more. I like Renata too. She is the feminine... and smart and curious and willing to do what is not done.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is good about this book is NOT the plot, because that is practically non-existent! It is a character study. It is an essay on death and how each of us deals with it. And the choices we make. It is also about the folly of war. It is about hunting and food and fishing and ....about the world around us if we just bother to look. Hemingway expresses so simply what is before our eyes and that which we often don't see. OK, the Colonel goes duck hunting, but there is much more to hunting than just killing birds. (Why must people hunt; why can't people instead shoot with their cameras?) Still, Hemingway opens our eyes to the beauty of the land and the birds and the air and that is enough for me.\n",

Their project: a Hollywood movie called Love on Ice.\n",

      "The novel works on many levels: as a critique of Hollywood at the time it is informed by Schulberg´s own personal circumstances. He was the son of a studio boss and writer of the screenplay of On The Waterfront. And he did really work with Scott Fitgerald, who emerges from the book as a sorry, sodden figure, once glittering at the centre of a brilliant world, now thrown up on some distant shore, alone, hungover, stuck with the memories of that time and unable to overcome himself and drag himself back there. Dirty suit, dirty thoughts, occasional flashes of the old genius and a desire to drink, drink, drink!\n",

'The Disenchanted' is about a Scott Fitzgerald-like writer, a once famous author who finds himself co-writing a bit of mediocre Hollywood froth with a young scriptwriter who happens to be an admirer of the writer's best work. Not realising that his idol is an alcoholic, the young screenwriter plies him with champagne on the plane, thus setting him off on a tragi-comic binge.

      "A dated yet compelling look at a fictional marriage and lifestyle in the early-to-mid 20th century that confronted the prejudices of Brahmin Boston. While the attitudes may seem shocking to the modern reader, Keyes, as always, depicts a bygone era with care and vivid accuracy. The Beacon Hill setting, just a few blocks from the Massachusetts State House and from John Kerry's beautiful home, add an appealing element.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "If you are reading this review either (1) you are already familiar with Keyes and her literary bon-bons and wonder if this one holds its taste in the 21st century or (2) you were charmed by the vintage book jacket at a library book sale and wonder whether to actually read it. In the case of 1, mostly. Keyes's sympathies clearly lay with the \"modern\" Boston Brahman newlyweds trying to expand the scope of their life beyond their conservative upbringing. She does a nice job of depicting life among the rich and wannabe rich in Boston, revolving around the young lawyers in a maverick law firm. It's an interesting note that big law firm law was thought to be just as soul-crushing in the 1930s as it is today. (2) If this book appealed to you enough to buy, you will probably have seen \"Old Acquaintance\" on TCM, the one where Miriam Hopkins writes vastly popular \"women's novels\" out of spite and jealousy directed at her best frenemy, \"serious writer\" Bette Davis. \"Joy Street\" is exactly the kind of book Miriam Hopkins's character would have written. Act accordingly.\n",

      "I feel exhausted, emotionally drained, as if I had run a marathon, all dressed up in full military kit. Reading James Jones is often hard work, but there is also the satisfaction of reaching the finish line and knowing you achieved something great. Because, even as I think that a good editor could have cut the text in half and still achieve the same effect, I know that James Jones has captured the spirit of army life in the 1940's flawlessly, that the ocean of trivial details from the lives of trivial people builds up into a monumental canvas of a whole society : Hawaii on the brink of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't know what to expect beforehand, as I steered away from the movie version until I could read the book. I found no heroes and no glorious battles here.

      "exclaims at one point Chief Choate, a full Choctaw Indian that has found refuge from discrimination and poverty in the military life. Echoing him is the opening scene of the main character, Robert E Lee Prewitt, a former star bugler who resigned his grades and comes to join a new outfit at the Schofield Barracks as a simple infantryman.\n",

      "\n",

      "Prewitt is a fully developed character, multi-faceted and deeply troubled by the events that surrounds his one year in the 'jockstrap' G Company. But if I were to pick up one defining feature of his personality, it would be his devotion to the army, despite the many injustices he is subject to. In his own words, he is a 'thirty-year-man', a professional, career soldier and not a drafted, temporary visitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word 'jockstrap' that I used earlier is just one of the numerous jargon terms and acronyms that military outfits seem to love so much. In the 1941 context, the word refers to a peace-time policy of gathering in one company all the athletes and fighters in a regiment, give them privileges and ranks, and train them for internal competitions where their regiment and their officers gain prestige by the athletic achievements. Prewitt lands in this G Company because he used to be not only a damn good bugler, but also a champion lightweight boxer. An unfortunate accident that left his sparring partner blinded convinced Prewit that he should give up boxing, something that his new commanding officer refuses to accept, putting in motion a whole chain of events aimed at breaking the will of the new recruit. In the same military parlance this is called \"The Treatment\", something I experienced a mild form of in my own short term military service. The subject of The Treatment is singled out for the most exhausting drill routines, for the least appealing 'fatigue' duties, for repeated punishment for any real or imaginary insubordination. What the officers don't realize is that Prewitt is a former child miner from the Kentucky mountains, a man who would rather die than bend to the will of an outsider:\n",

      "I am tempted to write a detailed review of the steps taken by Prewitt from the morning he gazes at a field of pineapples outside the barracks to his night time run across a golf field in the aftermath of the Japanese attack, but there are so many important aspects of his personality that it would take me weeks to organize and explain his motivations and his outlook on life. Just as important as Prewitt, and just as well drawn, are the people that surround him, with their own powerful dramas, their own disappointments and defeats in love, in their professional career, in their sanity even. The modell first sergeant Milton Warden, the cook Maylon Stark, fellow infantryman Angelo Maggio, love interest Lorene, army wife Karen Holmes, star athlete Chief Choate and many, many other memorable people that together justify the epic scope of the novel. Also worthy of analysis are the numerous philosophical, social and political debates that slow down the pacing of the novel, yet provoke the reader to give more attention to the context and implications of the story. Maybe I will do all of these aspects justice on an eventual re-read (I'm still recovering from pneumonia at the moment).\n",

      "Music is the most powerful redemptive force in the life of Prewitt, who was exposed at an early age to the blues culture of his native South and who found expression for his inner soul in the sound of his bugle, a passion denied to him by the narrow mindedness and corruption of his superiors. My favourite passage from the book (and from the movie that I had finally been able to watch with a clear conscience) is of Prewitt singing his regiment to sleep :\n",

      "This spirituality in Prewitt is countered and subverted by his impulsive, sensualist temperament. He is a heavy drinker, like everybody else in the regiment from the lowest infantryman to the top general. He is an addicted gambler, losing his pay at poker in a couple of hours after he gets it in his hands (). He is womanizer, a regular of the bawdy houses, again like almost everybody around him. He is foul mouthed and violent, rigidly proud and suspicious and difficult to befriend. He is even showing signs of racism and homophobia, again symptoms of the society he is living in. Yet Prewitt does open up to a few select people, like the fellows he is jamming with in the evenings on guitars, singing interminable blues sessions that will produce maybe the one enduring masterpiece of Prewitt's life : \"The Re-enlistment Blues\"\n",

      "I have told you about my favourite part : Prewitt singing Taps in the evening. I should also talk a little about some parts that were problematic. One of these is the portrayal of homosexuals - it may be a good thing that their culture is mentioned and given exposure at a time when most of the establishment pretended they don't exist, but for one thing Prewitt and his friends are boasting about beating these guys up, and for another, there is an implication that gays are damaged goods and have deep psychological issues:\n",

      "Also disturbing, but I believe in a necessary way, is the exposure of the cruel practices deployed by the jailers of recalcitrant soldiers in the Stockade. Both Maggio and Prewitt end up in the slammer, where they are subject to much more atrocious brutalities than \"The Treatment\" . It is said that Jones book provoked a review of these practices and abuses in the US Army. If true, the novel has served its purpose admirably.\n",

      "Before I close my review, I would like to mention that I saw the movie of Fred Zinnemann from 1953 soon after reading the novel. I believe the casting was inspired, in particular Montgomery Clift and Burt Lancaster. I also think Zinneman did a decent job with the huge material he had in the book, but he also did a lot of changes to tone down the harshness of the foul language, the drinking and the whoring. This isn't as important as the whitewashing of the army officers, who are shown in the late parts of the movie to punish the abusive behaviour of Captain 'Dynamite' Holmes. In the novel he is promoted and given more power to apply his doctrine of discipline through fear.\n",

Luke had been searchig on behalf of Joseph of Arimithea who old and feeble as he is, is intent on securing the best and most talented artisan to design a chalice which will be made to fit the cup used by Jesus at The Last Supper\". Joseph has safeguarded the cup over the years as the Zealots are intent on destroying any remnants of Jesus and eradicating the entire Christian faith.

      "First, I want to describe how this book came into my hands. I was browsing at a secondhand shop, skimmed its blurb and thought, 'Hmm, this looks like one of those Biblical epics. Meh, well, why not?' It joined my stash of old books to be looked at down the track, some of which never see the light of day for ages. A few weeks later, I stumbled across a list of the bestselling books for each year from the 1930s to the early 2020s. And this was on it! It's America's bestselling fiction title of 1952, and Australia probably followed suit. Since I'm keen to tick some off, this serendipitous discovery seemed a perfect starting place. I went in with no expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it blew me away!\n",
      "\n",
      "So we're plunged instantly into New Testament times. Some of the events that take place in the Bible's Book of Acts are happening offstage simultaneously. Our hero is a talented young artisan named Basil, who was adopted by a wealthy businessman to be his son and heir. But Basil is majorly screwed over by his wicked step-uncle, who sells him as a slave to an exploitative silversmith. From there, he's purchased by Luke the Physician (yep, that Luke) who brings him to meet Joseph of Arimathea. The elderly church heroes have a daunting commission for our boy. They possess the modest cup used by Jesus and his apostles in the Upper Room at the Last Supper, and want a special silver chalice created to hold it, which must feature the faces of Jesus's most beloved followers. They've chosen Basil, who is about 19 years old at this stage, to be the artist.\n",
      "\n",
      "His task involves travelling to key places where each model happens to live, often in exile, to record their likenesses so he can start his job. Needless to say, this takes far more than a snap from a phone camera, or a sketch on a drawing pad. Basil must form accurate little wax models, sometimes surreptitiously, for his records. And the scope of the action includes Antioch, his starting point, Jerusalem, Ephesus and Rome. It's extremely perilous, since several passionate groups want to stamp out his effort, including High Jewish officials, Zealots and the Roman conquerors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved Basil. He's exactly the sort of protagonist it's fun to stand behind and barrack for. Essentially, he's just a kid with an amazing talent that proves to be a mixed blessing, turning him into something of a puppet. Basil's social status and time period make it easy for several different people to control his destiny, each with their own agendas in mind. Basil is in no position to do anything about it. When people who pull strings say, 'Jump,' he has to say, 'How high?' rather than, 'Get lost!' as he'd often prefer. The cycle starts when he's only ten years old, and Ignatius the wealthy olive oil magnate arranges with Basil's biological father, Theron, to adopt him. The boy himself gets no say in the matter. But one of my favourite examples occurs when Basil is summoned before the Emperor, Nero. 'Caesar does not invite. He commands!'\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a fantastic cast of supporting characters. I love the role Luke the gospel writer plays in this story. Paul comes across as bold and bossy as he probably was; the encounter with John was arduous but mind-blowing, and I won't reveal too much about Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sneaky villain, Simon the Sorcerer plays a huge role, as he attempts to undermine the miracles of Jesus with his chicanery, and the public lap it up. And Basil's intriguing love triangle adds a dash of romance. Two young women are crazy about the young artist. Will his heart swing toward Deborra, the granddaughter of Joseph, or Helena, a former cheeky slave of his stepfather's?\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the questions driving the plot concerns Basil's ultimate success. He worries that if his ability to make the chalice will depend on the purity of his own state of mind, it's doomed, for lots has happened to make him bitter and vengeful in his short life. I love it that Bible stories are always drawn from by characters as real and living historical precedents to aid decision making, which is so refreshing in our era, when many people sweep them aside as legends or fairy tales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I'm impressed that in the mid-twentieth century, a Christian fiction (for what else could you call this?) could make it as the bestselling book on secular charts. Times have certainly changed. And the bestselling non-fiction for the same year was probably unsurprisingly, The Revised Standard edition of the Bible. And now I'm definitely interested to find out more about Costain's other historical fiction. Although he had a huge following in his heyday, this is the first time I'd ever heard of him.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "A lovely old book which tells the fictional story of what became of the cup used by Jesus at the last supper. A young boy named Basil is sold into slavery after the death of his rich adoptive father and he is apprenticed to a silversmith. Basil has a great gift for art which he is not allowed to use whilst working for the silversmith, having to churn out basic items ordered by customers, but as he learns the trade and how to handle silver his gift becomes known. In a round about way Joseph of Arimathea who famously gave his own tomb for Jesus to be buried in hears of his great talent and sends Luke the Apostle to find him and bring him to his home. Joseph has supported the Christians with his great wealth for the last thirty years or so since Jesus died, he is now a very old man and is cared for by is granddaughter Deborra, he does however have one last important task to accomplish before his death which he knows is not far off. He has in his possession the Holy Cup of the last supper, it is a very plain and even slightly dented cup, and he wants it to be contained in a beautiful silver mount with the images of the most important Apostles and Disciples depicted around it. Basil is chosen for the honour of creating this beautiful object and he has a limited time to make likenesses of the surviving few, Peter now old and living under a different name until such time as he was needed to resume his great work, Luke who was so kind to Basil, Paul still the fiery preacher unafraid for his own safety, and of course Joseph of Arimathea but the hardest of all was going to be Jesus. Could a likeness of Christ be achieved just from the descriptions of those who had know him while he was alive?\n",
      "This is the story of a long journey both literally and mentally for Basil in his quest to capture the likenesses required in time and to create the masterpiece fit to hold the Holy Chalice.\n",

      "\n",
      "Eugénie Bernardine Désirée Clary (8 November 1777 – 17 December 1860), in Swedish officially Eugenia Bernhardina Desideria, was Queen of Sweden and Norway as the consort of King Charles XIV John (a former French General and founder of the House of Bernadotte), mother of Oscar I, and one-time fiancée of Napoleon Bonaparte. She officially changed her name there to Desideria, which she did not use herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be young, in France, and in love: fourteen year old Desiree can't believe her good fortune. Her fiance, a dashing and ambitious Napoleon Bonaparte, is poised for battlefield success, and no longer will she be just a French merchant's daughter. She could not have known the twisting path her role in history would take, nearly breaking her vibrant heart but sweeping her to a life rich in passion and desire.\n",
      "\n",
      "A love story, but so much more, Désirée explores the landscape of a young heart torn in two, giving readers a compelling true story of an ordinary girl whose unlikely brush with history leads to a throne no one would have expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "An epic bestseller that has earned both critical acclaim and mass adoration, Désirée is at once a novel of the rise and fall of empires, the blush and fade of love, and the heart and soul of a woman.\n",

      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Of late, I have been picking up books read years ago to see if they still hold the same magic they once held for me. I picked up Beyond This Place, out of a portable community library box during my peregrinations around town, fifty years after I first read it as a teenager, and which, at the time, led me to devour all of A.J. Cronin’s major novels afterwards. Alas, the magic had evaporated this time around, although I could understand the social significance the novel may have once had.\n",
      "\n",
      "Set in the 1930’s, and published in 1950 after being serialized in Colliers, the novel artfully portrays the archaic and entrenched British customs and social hierarchies of the early twentieth century, uses outdated words and phrases (such as “queer” and “gaily”) out of present-day context, and is chock-full of page-turner chapter endings reminiscent of dime novels and magazine serializations. And yet, its message of the damning effect of the miscarriage of law and the human cost of punishment vs. rehabilitation in the British penal system is as current today as it was then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Burgess, 21, stumbles on his murky past when he tries to obtain a copy of his birth certificate to apply for a summer job (birth certificates for jobs? – that archaic British custom thing!). He discovers he had a different surname at birth, and that his father, Reese Mathry, who was supposed to have died on a trip to South America, is actually serving a life-sentence in Britain for murder. Determined to find the truth, Paul delves deeper, only to discover that his father may have been framed by an ambitious prosecutor intent on making a sensational trial debut that would lead him up the legal career ladder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul’s search becomes an obsession and pushes him into penury, destitution, and illness on the streets of London. It is only with the help of the long-suffering Lena, the fallen woman who puritanical Paul spurns due to her “having a child out of wedlock” (more archaic British customs!), and a couple of regional press reporters who believe this scoop will take them national, that the Mathry case is re-opened to startling revelations and a new conclusion.\n",

      "And yet the outcome for Paul of being re-united with his father is bitter-sweet. “Let sleeping dogs lie,” has some merit here, for a lifetime of harsh punishment inflicted on a man who had a low moral compass to begin with does not reveal a Nelson Mandela-type savant – quite the opposite, in fact. There is no possible reconciliation, only a new altered reality that has to be accepted, both by the Mathry family and by the British judiciary and its 700-year old trial-by-jury system that was deemed “best in class” until its wheels fell off in this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the serious moral message, the style of writing put me off. Dickensian plot contrivances abound, information dumps are provided in photographic detail by witnesses about events that took place fifteen years earlier, help arrives at the eleventh hour (always), dying old men speak like sprightly young ones, and the omniscient narrator jumps in and out of everyone’s head rending them into caricature. I realized why Cronin’s books were made into films, for many of his scenes are cinematic. His portrayal of London, especially the murky corners of the city, are well drawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let sleeping dogs lie” – I should have heeded that advice and let this book repose in its little community bookcase without picking it up, a book that, fifty ears ago, had inspired me to pursue reading more serious fiction. Like Paul discovered with his father Reese – you can’t go back to better times, you can only return to different experiences.\n",

      "Every so often, this Scottish author invades my awareness. I first read an A. J. Cronin book about an ethically constrained medical doctor (The Citadel) and about a troubled priest (Keys of the Kingdom) back when I was in junior high school. Those were the only two titles my little branch library had by that author, but I was rewarded later in life when I discovered a copy of Shannon’s Way , a novel about a physician researcher and a forbidden love who becomes deathly ill. I thought I was reading a rehash of Sinclair Lewis’ Arrowsmith for a few pages, but I assure you that it isn’t the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I started reading , originally published as a serial in magazine entitled , I thought I was being set up for a rather ordinary, perhaps predictable mystery. When the protagonist, Paul Mathry, discovers that his father is not deceased but incarcerated, he makes an impulsive move to visit his father in the penitentiary. Upon arriving, he discovers that this institution did not allow visitors. So, he goes to his old hometown to try to discover all that he can about the circumstances of his father’s downfall. There (surprise, surprise), he becomes convinced of his father’s innocence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In seeking to find a connection with his father, he begins to uncover what seems to be a conspiracy. Indeed, it appears to be such a conspiracy that even though he has put his career on hold in order to follow up certain leads, he becomes a victim to the conspiracy itself. Obviously, the protagonist eventually gets to the truth. But as I continued to read through the book, I realized that this was not a discount Sinclair Lewis, Upton Sinclair, or Theodore Dreiser. A. J. Cronin wasn’t merely writing about social reform though portions of the book profoundly call out for checks and balances within the legal system and warn against political ambitions. These characters felt real.\n",
      "\n",
      "features many instances of selfless, sacrificial acts which are received with ingratitude alongside actions which are purely from self-interest and actions where the characters believe they are doing exactly what is right to protect someone and, ironically, are actually hurting the person. There are characters which seem lovely and beautiful who, in turn, prove to be selfish and manipulative. There are characters which seem to be self-giving which are, in turn, discovered to be self-serving. There are characters which seem cowardly who prove to be courageous. This is one of the finest novels I can remember reading with regard to presenting a heterogeneous mix of attitudes, motivations, and desires within each of the main characters. There is , betrayal, disappointment, suspicion, and ambition at every turn. Yet, it is one of the most truthful books I have ever read. As I read this novel, I realized very quickly why so many A. J. Cronin works have made it to the silver screen. His plot may be fiction, but his characters speak with truth. Ingratitude, disappointment, triumph, failure, defeat, and death all figure into this marvelous exploration of human nature. While not as well-known as , has quickly become my favorite novel by this Scottish writer. If you like character studies juxtaposed with social commentary, I highly recommend . If you’re looking for a mystery with lots of “red herrings,” you’re probably going to be disappointed.\n",

      "\n",
      "Knowing how du Maurier researches her books, this work provided a lot of insight into Regency London, politics and social etiquette, that was mostly new to me. Without doubt, despite being strongly led by Mary Anne's life, this book is just as much a nod to the excesses, mores and realities of Regency London and the English ruling classes of the day. Yet another compelling page-turning read by du Maurier, with a non-conventional lead female protagonist (again :)) with the added bonus that the core of the book is based on historical fact. Enjoy! 8 out of 12.\n",

      "This is the story of Daphne du Maurier’s great-great-grandmother, Mary Anne Clarke, born into a poor family in the East End of London, married at fifteen and the mother of four children by the time she was twenty-three. Mary Anne became a notorious courtesan and mistress of the Duke of York and was later the central figure in a political corruption scandal, the repercussions of which ultimately led to her downfall.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Lisa Hilton, who wrote the introduction to the 2003 Virago edition, du Maurier did not much care for . She wrote that it was “lacking in human interest and reads like a newspaper report”. To some extent du Maurier was right. While it’s not really devoid of human interest, neither Mary Anne nor most of the other characters are particularly sympathetic. Although what motivates Mary Anne to behave in the way she does is understandable, it does not make her likeable. Further, much of the latter part of the book reads like transcripts from the parliamentary inquiry at which she gave evidence and the various trials in which she was involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outcome of this is an uneven tone. Part of the book reads like a novel and part of it reads like a biography. The writing is excellent, but the two parts of the book feel quite separate. It may be the lawyer in me, but I found the parliamentary inquiry and the trials incredibly interesting. However, I really would have liked a bibliography or at the very least an author’s note discussing the primary sources and explaining what is fact and what is fiction. What I would have liked even more, I think, is an actual biography, rather than historical fiction. If du Maurier had written a biography about her ancestor, this might have been a much better book. It could have been the of its time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, I don’t regret the time I’ve spent reading . In spite of its weaknesses, the book still demonstrates du Maurier’s consummate skill as a writer. She was able to create a sense of place and time without resorting to archaic vocabulary. The central characters – for all they are mostly unlikeable - are vividly realised and never feel like transplants from du Maurier’s time. There were also moments of wonderfully written sly humour.\n",
      "\n",
      "For me, this was a 3-1/2 star read. It gets half a star because I found the content about the parliamentary inquiry and the legal system so very interesting. Another buddy read with my friend Jemidar.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Although I would have previously sworn that it was impossible for du Maurier to write a bad book, this one comes periously close and although it had all the right elements; good story, fascinating real life people, great period setting, royalty, scandal etc it just never really came together for me. It felt disjointed, uneven, lacking in emotion and with a lacklustre, prosaic feel that du Mauriers other books just don't have. I missed her lyrical descriptions. I also struggled to sympathise with Mary Anne, and by the end I positively disliked her, not caring one bit about her fate. Disappointingly, the narrative was a strange and uncomfortable mix of historical fiction and biography which never quite reached it's potential and in the end left me wanting more of both.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this is Daphne du Maurier we're talking about so even a 'meh' book by her is better than a lot of others out there. Just don't expect another Rebecca or Frenchman's Creek or My Cousin Rachel etc.\n",

      "I'm a bit conflicted about this book, I liked it and I'm glad I read it, but at the same time it really bothered me, it was depressing and I found myself alternating between being really proud of Mary Anne for being so strong and smart and being angry with her for being so foolish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary Anne Clarke was Daphne Du Maurier's great-great grandmother. She was clever, witty and beautiful. She was a mistress to Frederick Augustus Brunswick the Duke of York and Albany, son of King George III. She was also the star witness for the opposition when the House of Commons launched an investigation into allegations that the Duke had been accepting payments in exchange for military commissions. Mary Anne had an interesting life to say the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "The history in the story is sometimes difficult to follow, but at the same time it's not imperative that you know all the political details. I recently read 'The Secret Wife of King George IV' by Diane Haeger and was really glad I had some understanding of the references to the Prince of Wales and Mrs. Fritz, his wife and mistress. Du Maurier writes about Mary Anne's relationships with a subtlety that can escape the reader if they aren't paying close attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary Anne had guts to stand up to the government's cross-examination and the public scrutiny during the investigation, I admired her bravery. I thought it was fascinating that memorabilia was being produced and sold with Mary Anne's likeness during the scandal. So many things were as they are now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a fan of Daphne Du Maurier, I just love her writing and I'm also very curious about her family history. There's a lot of really fascinating stuff in the Du Maurier family tree. I wanted to read this book and get an idea about the Du Maurier family past. It took some courage to write this story the way that Du Maurier did. I'm sure I would have taken the sugar coated path if I had been writing about my great-great grandmother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Du Maurier describes the facade Mary Anne created to give people the impression she was living a luxurious and carefree life, the reader has to wonder if the same is true for the author. Was she living a life with a facade that was very different from reality, the more I read about her the more I think so.\n",

      "یک کتاب خسته کننده به سبک معمول نوشتن آقای اروینگ استون . عشق جاوید است هم به سبک کتاب قبلی که از آقای استون خوانده ام (شور هستی ) سرشار است از انبوه جزئیات ، هر جا هر شخصیتی وارد داستان می شود نویسنده چنان از سر صبر و حوصله به توصیف ظاهر و قیافه و هیکل و اندام و لباسی که پوشیده می پردازد که خواننده ( مثله من ) با خود فکر میکند که اصلا به من چه ! تازه هنوز شرح ظاهری طرف تمام نشده که نوبت به وصف صدای طرف می رسد این که یک نفر تو دماغی صحبت می کند ، آن یکی صدای بم دارد ، یکی روی حرف س خیلی تاکید دارد ! بعد به انواع غذا می رسیم ! این که گوشت سرد را کی باید خورد و بوقلمون را کی ! خلاصه نصفه کتاب با این جزئیات پر شده . اما داستان از نگاه ماری تاد همسر آبراهام لینکلن روایت می شود . این که چی ماری می پوشه و چی فکر میکنه و رابطه اش با مردم چگونه است هم حتما به اندیشه های آبراهام ارجحیت دارد ! متاسفانه کتاب داستان جذاب یکی از بزرگترین انسانهای دوران را فراموش کرده و به انبوه جزئیات خسته کننده پرداخته ، تنها چیزی که به خواننده در مورد آبراهام گفته میشود مخالفت او با برده داری ایست . اگر می خواهید بدانید که زندگی در آمریکای قرن نوزده چگونه بوده و علاقه ای به شناخت آبراهام ندارید کتاب خوبی است ! اما اگر به شناختن آبراهام علاقه مند هستید و مایل به دانستن چگونگی ایجاد پایه های مستحکم دموکراسی در آمریکا هستید باید کتاب دیگری را بخوانید . (البته من هنوز چنین کتابی را نخوانده ام ) . خلاصه پس از ترور مردان بزرگی مثله آبراهام لینکلن بود که نوبت به قدرت گرفتن افراد حقیری مثله دونالد رسید\n",

      "Mary Todd Lincoln always seemed a dour woman in the background from a historical perspective. However, this book depicts an intelligent woman prevented from achieving her full potential by conventions of the time period and circumstances. Though Lincoln would not allow her to make use of her political contacts, she could and did give input on Lincoln's ideas and speeches, in addition to providing a safe haven for him when he needed it. In spite of suffering from skull fracture as a result of a carriage accident, being tormented by society as to her status in their marriage, losing a child, and being accused of treason while Lincoln was president, she remained Lincoln's touchstone to the day he was assassinated. I took my time finishing the book, though, because I knew how it would end for these two remarkable people.\n",

      "This is a very readable novel detailing the lives of Mr. and Mrs. “President” Lincoln told from the perspective of Mary Todd Lincoln. It begins with her as a eligible young lady pursued by many in her hometown in Kentucky and continues as she travels to Springfield , Illinois where she stays with her married sister and family and where she meets Abraham. It continues with the years of their many political failures and their few successes during which she always encouraged his continuing the quest as she seemed to see his potential for leadership, in essence his destiny. And it goes into their years in the White House ending after his assassination. It also details all of the family tragedy and the national crisis years during the Civil War.\n",

      "It is well done and very well researched for authenticity; however, it was published first in 1954 and does at times feel a bit dated.\n",

      "Irving Stone is quickly becoming a favorite author. Never a great fan of reading history just for the sake of reading it, Stone brings history to life by using the historical fiction genre and providing interesting dialogue. I didn't know much about the Lincolns when I started reading this, other than what they teach in school. It was indeed sad how Abraham Lincoln struggled with melancholy and depression, but I found it amazing how he recognized it and usually worked himself through it. Despite her somewhat brusque and often misinterpreted manner, Mary Todd was a huge part of his victories while struggling herself with loss and tragedy. A remarkable couple living and changing our world during a remarkable time in our history.\n",

      "I discovered that copies of the book are still in my county's public library system, and put in a request for it (my request for now-obscure titles such as this one, and FENGRIFFEN, THE STORY OF ESTHER COSTELLO, THE ORACLE and LOVERS ALL UNTRUE must have librarians - especially younger ones - scratching their heads as they head into the stacks.\n",

      "5/02: Although this got off to a slow start, by about a quarter of the way through it became quite engrossing. Anson Page's return to his roots causes him to reflect back on his life in Pompey's Head and the people he knew there. The result is an entertaining novel about growing up in the South during the 1920s/1930s, and its ingredients are pretty much everything we've inevitably come to expect of such novels set in the South: economical (economic changes have come to several residents), social (resulting from those economic changes, and everyone worries a great deal over what will be thought or said about whatever they do), and racial (there is an account of a trial to obtain financial damages for an injured black man who works for Anson’s father).\n",
      "\n",
      "At 409 pages the novel is a bit flabby - excising a few unnecessary repetitions would have tightened it up a bit. Looking back from 2012, the big secret regarding the missing royalties doesn’t really carry the impact it would have in 1954, but that's to be expected; all in all I think this falls comfortably into the \"They Don't Write 'em Like This Anymore\" category.\n",

The writing is strong enough to keep the reader's attention even though the first two parts are just lawyers sitting around talking in between Anson's memories. It really gets interesting when Anson returns to Pompey's Head. Yes, it is about \"you can't go home\" but it's also about \"home\" being a place Anson needed to identify with/feel belonging but never could. Home is home, no matter if one did not belong there. The entrenched practices and beliefs in place are still there although Anson has long since moved on from the class and race divisions that people in Pompey's Head cling so desperately to in order to forge their own identities and find meaning.\n",

      "An easy to read book. I enjoyed the window into life in the 1920s into the early 1950s, and I liked the insight of the business world at the the time.

      "\n",
      "Unfortunately this isn't one of his better works. It does include Marquand's classic lampooning of eastern blue bloods, along with his ability to display such antics in the omniscient thoughts of the central character. But for me anyway, it doesn't have the same resonance and impact of his other novels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, it also unfortunately hasn't aged well. It was hard to overlook the racist expression of a supporting character (and repeated later by the central one, Willis Wayde). So too are the chauvinist thoughts of Willis towards all females, particularly those of his wife Sylvia (i.e. chapter 26: \"\"). Arguably, much of Marquand's writing included such bromides, though with this story I found it even more obvious than I recall previously.\n",

      "This book is very different from his traditional corpus, the Mr. Moto spy novels. In this book, Marquand examines the life a typical, modern business executive. Willis Wayde is successful by most measures, such as wealth, marriage, business acumen, and overall success. However, those are the only measures he understands as measures of success and personal worth and integrity. Wayde thinks that because he has made long-time acquaintances wealthier, he has done them right. As a result he cannot understand their rejection of him when he breaks a promise to them that seals the deal that makes them wealthy. He simply does not understand that integrity might be more than just a standard of living.\n",

      "When the young Henry McKenzie first arrived in Kenya to begin farming his future plantation, he hired a down on his luck Karanja, who had just lost his wife, children and most of his tribe to plague. The 2 men worked together and became close personal friends as well. With time and hard work the plantation became prosperous and both men were now enjoying the fruits of their labor.\n",

      "Karanji was the leader of the Kikuyu people living and working on the McKenzie plantation and he delighted in his only son Kimani, who had attended the white man's schools along with Peter McKenzie. Kimani and Peter had grown up together and were as close as brothers. Kimani had excelled in school and was well set for the future.\n",

      "\n",
      "Peter's sister had married Jeff, the owner of the next door plantation. Jeff had invited both teens to join him on a weekend hunting trip which they gladly accepted. Kimani was to be Peter's assistant and helper as was the norm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kimani was not happy serving under Peter since they had always been treated equally when young. Kimani sulked and wasn't doing a good job on the hunt, which soon caused Jeff to lose patience with the insolent Kimani. When Jeff angrily slaps Kimani, the outraged Kimani vows to kill Jeff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kimani would reveal to the reader that he thought himself more deserving to inherit the plantation - not Peter, although Kimani generously allows that Peter would still be able to work on the plantation, but he would kill all the other whites.\n",

      "That slap would reverberate and affect the lives of everyone on the plantation with Kimani soon joining the communist led Mau Mau rebellion.\n",

      "Just an all around violent book which might be too much for a lot of people to read.\n",

      "I was recomended this book by somebody and thought it was going to be a politically incorrect (honest) account of the communist funded Mau Mau revolution in Kenya. What it actually is, is a historical fiction account of it. I was truly blown away by this book. Even though it doesn't always portray the whites in a very good light idiots would say this book is racist because it shows the utter brutality and ignorant superstions of the blacks. These days you are only allowed to show the bad side of whites. As great as this book is I doubt that it could get published now. Personally I believe it just shows in an honest way how both the whites and blacks thought and like I said the whites aren't always portrayed in the best light either.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was amazing how tough and self sufficent the English settlers had to be. With all due respect to them, the American settlers in the old west had nothing on these people. Their big weakness was they were greedy and had to have black servants and workers on their farms. I actually thinks its possible the British upper class who felt threatened by the self made wealth, power and strength of the settlers, may have even covertly had a hand in supporting the Mau Maus. Another interesting fact is Barack Obamas Father worked for the genocidal Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya after he returned to Kenya. This is something blacks all over the world who idolize Obama and the Mau Maus need to be aware of more than anyone because the Mau Maus of course killed many whites but they were responsible for tens if not hundreds of thousands of dead Africans.\n",

      "Not at all my sort of book. And yet, I found Something of Value compellingly repelling. Set in late 1940’s - 1950’s Kenya, Kimani, a Kikuyu, and Peter McKenzie, were boyhood friends made enemies by a cultural misunderstanding turned tragedy. Their relationship seemed to stand representative for the two primary races in the Mau Mau Uprising (1952-1960) which provides the background for the second half of the story.\n",

      "I learned about as I was reading . It was listed as one of those books of the time period of that novel, also the 1950’s, and never having heard of it, it intrigued me. As it is set in Kenya, there are some familiar terms for those who have read, , and in fact Ruark lists as an adviser for this book. The first half of the book is along those lines, or anyway, readers of Huxley will feel at home.\n",

      "Initially I gave a star rating. I have since withdrawn it as I am so conflicted about this book. Technically-speaking, it is a fine fictionalized account of a tormented historical event and yet even so, I personally did not care for choices the author made in telling it. Mr. Ruark could have told the same story (IMHO) without including quite so much detailed descriptions of gore. After initial explanations, it is my contention, he could have achieved his purpose by reference rather than repetition and elaboration.\n",

      "A surprising account of the Mau Mau Rebellion in British Kenya in the early 1950's. Why is it surprising? Mainly because it's brutal in it's accounting of atrocities committed by both the Blacks and Whites.I didn't expect that from a mainstream novel published in the mid-1950's. The book doesn't pull any punches and it doesn't let either side off. The book makes it clear both sides are to blame.\n",

      "However, as another reviewer has pointed out, Ruark does write mostly from the white farmer's point of view since he knew the farmers and he couldn't help but write from their perspective. Also this book was written in the 1950's when the Cold War was at it's height and there is the inevitable appearance of the Soviets, albeit only in one chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mau Mau Rebellion is shown to be the tool of those who would ensure that Communism takes over Africa. So, despite Ruark's effort at being balanced, the fact that he personally knew many white settlers in Kenya and was anti-communist (and very few Americans weren't at this time in American history)ensures that the story comes down more on the side of the settlers.\n",
      "\n",
      "This novel is brutal and stark in it's depiction of the violence that swept Kenya during the Mau Mau Rebellion. The dramatic story aspects are more typical of the 1950's. Melodrama,unfaithful spouses, heavy drinking and other assorted cliches that reminded me of an Irwin Shaw novel. In addition Ruark tends to get carried away with the Stream of Consciousness as a narrative tool at times. Used once in awhile it's effective, but he goes back to it once to often and it gets tiresome.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were times I found myself having to trudge through parts of the book. However, all in all, it's an interesting read. It even serves as a contemporary source on the Mau Mau, as opposed to a historical text that has been written in the past few years. Perhaps not as accurate, but gives one insight into the minds of those who were actually living through the rebellion.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Robert Ruark, a journalist and writer of some success came to Kenya in 1949 to go on hunting safari. While there he became a close friend of the famed white hunter Harry Selby who owned a 40,000 acre cattle ranch in the White Highlands near Mt Kenya. During the next six years he went back several times and was a firsthand witness to the beginning of the Mau Mau rebellion and State of Emergency which began in 1952 up until the eventual suppression of the rebellion in 1956. The violence of the rebellion and the impact it had on the small white Kenyan settler community was given wide newspaper coverage in Europe and North America but Ruark thought the coverage was overly biased in favour of the white settlers’ point of view. So Ruark decided to write a novel about it. “Something of Value” was published in 1955 and became an instant success. Two years later a film based on the book was launched starring Rock Hudson, Dana Winter and Sidney Poitier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruark wanted his novel to give a more balanced account of the causes and effects of the violence that took place. He did this through the eyes of two protagonists: Peter McKenzie, the son of a wealthy and widowed white cattle rancher and Kimani, the eldest son of the Kikuyu foreman of his father’s ranch. The two leading characters begin as inseperable friends and playmates long before the outbreak of hostilities but as the two age and the tensions between the white settler community and resident Kikuyus gradually increase each becomes more radicalized: Peter as a reluctant defender of white settler values and racial prejudices and Kimani, after a cutting insult to his pride, as a committed leader of the Mau Mau rebels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both protagonists are damaged by the conflict. Although Peter McKenzie is the victor, it is a Phyrric victory. He has lost everything he loves: his father, his sister and his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Striking about the book is its brutal realism, based on Ruark’s surprisingly profound understanding of Kikuyu and white settler values and prejudices, and personal fascination with the art of big game hunting. The theme echoed throughout the book is that in the natural world “death builds life”. But in this story, this law of Nature becomes the law of Man as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also interesting is his extensive use of Kikuyu and Swahili words to capture the emotion and atmosphere and the detailed and bloody description of the violence that occurred. It’s a very readable and realistic story, and the horrible lessons it teaches about the systematic use of killings to achieve certain political ends could well apply to the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia or the child soldiers in Sierra Leone and Central Africa.\n",

      "The Last Hurrah, published in the mid-nineteen fifties, was Edwin O'Connor's first success and his most popular novel. The plot of The Last Hurrah focuses on a mayoral election in an unnamed East Coast city. Veteran Irish, Democratic Party politician Frank Skeffington is running for yet another term as Mayor. As a former governor, he is usually called by the honorific title \"Governor.\" While the city is never named, it is frequently assumed to be Boston. As a result of this novel, he was forever associated with Irish Boston—although he never did quite admit in interviews that he had used Boston’s greatest rascal, the often-elected mayor James Michael Curley, as the model for Skeffington. The story is told in the third person, either by a narrator or by Adam Caulfield, the Mayor's nephew. Skeffington is a veteran and adept \"machine\" politician, and probably corrupt as well. The novel portrays him as a flawed great man with many achievements to his credit. One of Adam's friends explains that the election was \"a last hurrah\" for the kind of old-style machine politics that Skeffington had mastered. Developments in American public life, including the consequences of the New Deal, have so changed the face of city politics that Skeffington no longer can survive in the new age with younger voters. And prophetically, for the first time, television ads win the day.\n",
      "Reading it as a teenager in high school I was fascinated with the realistic portrayal of politics and the impact on the city and family of the larger-than-life Skeffington. Both a popular and literary success when published, it remains in my memory as one of the best political novels I have ever read.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Politics, politics, politics. It was a tedious read and I only finished it as it was a book club assignment.\n",
      "Review 5\n",

      "Another terrific read! This is another book from the list of books about America that should be read by foreigners looking to learn just how this country of ours works.\n",
      "\n",
      "This one is about urban politics during the first half of the 20th century. Arthur Schlesinger said it is \"The best American novel about urban politics.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It is an hilariously funny read about a most serious subject. It's not always pretty, and Frank Skeffington, the main character, is not always admirable. But he's a man of his times and culture, and O'Connor has pegged him perfectly. You may not always like him or how he runs his city, but you care about him. He's real. He's likeable in an odd sort of way. And all his various cronies and hangers-on are funny, sad and pathetic all at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they all come to the realization (Skeffington first) that the old order is on the way out and that their time has passed, it is just heartbreaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book is supposedly set in a city in the Midwest, but O'Connor was a Bostonian, and it has always been assumed that he wrote this about Boston politics. Think the Kennedy family -- in particular the patriarch, Joseph Kennedy.\n",

      "Unbelievably this novel was the #1 bestseller in 1956. I found it so boring that I had to resort to the chapter-a-day reading plan to get it done. It is one of those war books about a naval base that aims to show the absurdity of soldiering for fellows who aren't actually out fighting; the sort of books that are supposed to be funny and undoubtedly inspired M*A*S*H.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trouble here is that it is not that funny and the writing style would put the most hardcore insomniac to sleep. Perhaps it is a guy thing and I just didn't get it. After all it sold the most books that year, although I used to watch M*A*S*H every week and laugh my head off.\n",

      "Read this in High School when life in America had less troubles, not really! But, I thought so at the time. This is 1950's humor good clean fun and innocent too! The author William Brinkley served as an P.R. officer in the navy during WWII. His brand of humor and cast of characters rings of real life which leads me to believe that behind all humorous stories lie some truth. Some of the the most unforgettable characters in this book are Lt. Commander Nash known to his men as \"Marblehead\" and Boatswain's Mate Second Class Farragut Jones all I can say he is a piece of work! If you have been in the military you have met this character!!! This book was a best seller in 1956 and was turned into a movie staring Glen Ford. Humor maybe dated for some...\n",

      "I decided to read this book after I saw a list of 'the most popular book the year you were born' and this is the book was written in 1956. It is a little dated but a delightful story none the less. It's about a group of men in the Pacific, during WW2 and their job was PR for the Navy, hence the title. This has given me the idea to give my Dad the book from 1929 next year on his 90th birthday. The book from that year...All Quiet on the Western Front.\n",

      "John is an Englishman well-educated in everything French – the language, the history and the culture. He passes on all his knowledge as a lecturer at a university; he travels in France with ease. What he lacks, however, is a connection with the people. At the tail end of a tour in this country, John has fallen victim to a feeling of melancholy, of failure. He feels as an outsider, both in his own country of England as well as in France. He yearns to feel a part of the people, a kinship with his fellow human beings.\n",

What should happen, however, if you had the opportunity to take someone’s place? Would you do it? When John bumps into an exact likeness of himself in a tavern, he is given precisely this chance. While John is a lonely man with a feeling of emptiness inside, Comte Jean de Gué claims to have only the problem of having too many ‘human’ possessions. Jean wants to play a clever game – that of switching identities with John and assuming each other’s lives. When John wakes the next morning, stripped of his own clothes and everything he had on his person, what choice does he have but to put on another man’s clothes, take his suitcase and assume this new life?\n",

John, as the new Comte Jean de Gué, finds himself taking on a failing business and a family with secrets and complex feelings. John will come to know Jean through this family and his interactions with them. Jean may not be the kind of person our narrator would wish to emulate if given a choice. But isn’t he somehow responsible for these people now that he has allowed himself to be an accomplice to this deception? Does he want Jean to fail because he feels a victim in this charade? Perhaps John is Jean de Gué’s scapegoat, or maybe another is fulfilling this role in the drama that plays out in this wounded family.\n",

      "Have you ever wanted to run away from your life? What would happen if you suddenly had the chance to; would you \"grasp the nettle\"? Or what if a new life was imposed on you, whether you liked it or not? Such is the premise of Daphne du Maurier's 1957 novel, The Scapegoat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Scapegoat is reminiscent of novels such as, \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" and according to one of Daphne du Maurier's biographers, this rollicking adventure was a favourite story of Daphne's when she was a little girl. But it also owes a great deal to as Daphne du Maurier also explores how two selves begin to feel as if they are part of the same person, the viewpoint character. In fact it is neither a straightforward adventure story as in Anthony Hope's tale, nor a dark study of two individuals; personalities within the same body, as in Robert Louis Stevenson's classic horror story. It lies somewhere between the two, yet is also an unsettling tale, full of suspense, sometimes even having a dream-like quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daphne du Maurier had the idea for when she was in France in 1955, to research the lives of her ancestors, the Busson-Mathurins, who were glass-blowers. She did subsequently write the novel for which she intended this research, entitling it (1963). But before writing it, she became distracted by a number of incidents that happened to her in France, which inspired the plot of , published in 1957. She apparently wrote it at record speed, finishing within six months, and then collapsed with nervous exhaustion.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the triggers was that while out for a walk in a square in a French town, Daphne du Maurier saw a man who looked identical to someone she happened to know. According to one of her biographers, Judith Cook, she then watched a family scene through a window, and began to put the two incidents together in her feverish imagination. Typically, she began to wonder about the people; who they were, and what their secrets might be,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and so the seeds of were sown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another instance provides part of the novel's setting. Houses often seem to take on a life of their own in Daphne du Maurier's novels. For example, in , seems to be imbued with as much of a presence - to be as much a character - as any of the actual people in the book. Indeed in her own life, she seems to have had an almost obsessive love for her the house she rented for so many years. Here in France, as part of her research, Daphne du Maurier discovered a house that had belonged to one of her ancestors two hundred years earlier. Exploring the derelict buildings, she saw fragments of the glass they had made, still there, scattered by the wind. She used these impressions and experiences, drawing on them to create an atmospheric, dramatic suspense novel, set in France.\n",
      "\n",
      "In , her ancestral glass-blowing foundry became the failing business of the de Gué family. They in turn were depicted as more grand, in fact minor aristocrats, the Comte and Comtesse. And instead of writing herself into the story, the author took on the guise of a male narrator, one of five occasions in major novels when she did this.\n",
      "\n",
      "The narrator, and viewpoint character, is an Englishman named John. At the start of the novel we learnt that John is dissatisfied with his life as a university lecturer, and tending to become depressed with what he sees as a futile life. It is evident that he is travelling through France, where he meets a man who eerily is his double in looks; a confident French count, Jean de Gué. Intrigued despite himself, John plays along with the Count's wishes, indulging in a night of drinking, and staying in an anonymous downbeat hotel overnight. On waking, he discovers that the man has disappeared, taking all John's own clothes and belongings, and leaving him to play the role of the \"Comte Jean de Gué\". Thus we have the novel's basic premise.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first confused, John then becomes angry,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And a little later, he describes being,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He thus become his double's scapegoat, and the events which follow enmesh him further in deceit and duplicity, which at first he considers to be in itself wrong, but quickly comes to regard as a means of basic survival,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "John learns about the idiosyncratic family he has been thrust amidst. He learns how his doppelgänger had influenced the destinies of these individuals, mercilessly twisting their lives to his own purpose. Gradually John begins to feel sympathy for the family who have accepted him, John, totally at face value. They have treated him variously with the emotions he has seemed to lack in his life so far; that is with love or hatred, but rarely with indifference. And as the novel proceeds we become aware that John has become emotionally committed to this family, within the space of seven days. He determines to use his family position as a tool, to influence both the workers in the factory, and \"his\" individual family member's lives for the better. Although a scapegoat, he is desperate to learn everything about the family intrigues, deceptions, jealousies and murders, both the events in the past and also those in the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed there are at least two other contenders for the description of \"scapegoat\". Either the daughter or the wife could be seen in these terms. Marie-Noel seems over-eager to sacrifice herself for her father, as does Françoise, the Count's wife. The intensity of the little girl Marie-Noel's relationship with her father is clearly a reflection of that between the author, Daphne du Maurier, and her own father, the charismatic actor-manager Gerald du Maurier.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Daphne du Maurier's descriptions of the little girl's religious fervour, as well as that of her aunt Blanche, serve well to heighten the tension at various points. It borders on the macabre, and makes the novel seem almost a gothic tale. All Daphne du Maurier's novels are tightly plotted, and this one, like is full of suspense, coincidence, hints and dark secrets. The narrator continually suspects various members of his family - including his doppelgänger - of not only duplicity, but also of some evil deeds in the past. The whole novel is driven by the narrator's desperate desire for knowledge and understanding. He never reflects back on what has led him to this point, or what his life has been so far, but always concentrates on remaining undiscovered, and as the novel proceeds, on influencing the future of his \"adopted family\" for their good.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with many of Daphne du Maurier's novels, there are so many elements of mystery that it is sometimes rather like reading a detective story. She often drops hints to the reader; clues carefully planted so that the reader is able to puzzle out the various roles and relationships before the viewpoint character John does. We suspect Renée's behaviour, for example, before John seems to have an inkling of why she seems so overly flirtatious and petulant. And we know who the woman Béla in the neighbouring village of Villars must be.\n",

      "At this point just less than half-way through, the dream-like quality is notched up a step, and we realise that John is beginning to perceive another, darker, personality hidden within his own self, much as the character did, but more subtly. Although Jekyll became subsumed and ultimately destroyed by the malignant influence of Hyde, John conversely seems to become more self-possessed and confident through his exploration of his darker self. He seems to become, in a sense, a more complete character, and his past a mere shadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are recurring themes in this novel. Take the motif of a broken ornament, for instance. In , the episode where the new wife accidentally destroys a valuable china ornament given to her predecessor (Rebecca) on her marriage, and becoming a particular favourite, is powerfully symbolic. Here there is a similar event involving Anne-Marie and her mother, and a porcelain cat and dog,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Real-life dogs are another device.

Clearly from this letter though, it is what she intended, and perhaps had to wrestle with internally herself. Perhaps after all it is a fitting ending to a novel, in which she delved into John/Jean's - and possibly her own - psyche and explored other, imaginary selves. Did she explore mere fantasies, or their secret lives? Increasingly after this novel, she became intrigued by what she called the \"dark side\" of our natures, and some of her best short stories and novellas, explore this theme. , and , are examples.

      "“Scandalous occurrences, of a public nature that is, do not often take place in small towns. Therefore, although the closets of small-town folk are filled with such a number of skeletons that if all the bony remains of small-town shame were to begin rattling at once they would cause a commotion that could be heard on the moon, people are apt to say that nothing much goes on in towns like Peyton Place. While it is true, no doubt, that the closets of city dwellers are in as sad disorder as those of small-town residents, the difference is that the city dweller is not as apt to be on as intimate terms with the contents of his neighbor’s closet as is the inhabitant of a smaller community. The difference between a closet skeleton and a scandal, in a small town, is that the former is examined behind barns by small groups who convene over it in whispers, while the latter is looked upon by everyone, on the main street, and discussed in shouts from rooftops. In Peyton Place, there were three sources of scandal: suicide, murder and the impregnation of an unmarried girl…”\n",
      "- Grace Metalious,\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s always fascinating to read books that were deemed controversial in an earlier age. Doing so provides a unique insight into a society’s mores, its conception of itself, and its fears. Plus, it’s super amusing to find out what gave your parents, or your grandparents, or your great-grandparents the vapors, especially since the goalpost on those things have moved so dramatically in the last hundred years.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was first published in 1956, Grace Metalious’s was derided as “salacious” and “trashy” and “wicked” and “cheap.” Libraries refused to lend it. Booksellers refused to sell it. Despite – or just as likely, because of – this, it became a huge bestseller. It later spawned a movie, a sequel, a sequel to the movie, and a television series.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsurprisingly, given its age, feels positively tame by today’s standards. To be sure, it covers a whole host of hot button issues that would not be out of place in a novel written today: murder, suicide, abortion, incest (sort of), premarital sex, extramarital sex, class inequities, and substance abuse. Nevertheless, Metalious handles everything with a great deal of discretion. For instance, there isn’t a sex scene in this book that goes past second base. Furthermore, Metalious – despite her famed insouciance – is pretty rigorous in punishing her characters for transgressing moral boundaries, almost as though she were operating under the Hays Code. By way of example, a “peeping tom” literally while watching her neighbors make non-procreative love on their patio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since this is not nearly as scandalous as its reputation implies, the question becomes: is there a reason to read ?\n",

      "A summary of is difficult, because there is no grand arc to it. Unlike the movie, which pared Metalious’s sprawling work down to a traditional (and somewhat boring) coming-of-age story, the novel does not have a traditional plot. There is no central protagonist, no single conflict, no obvious through-line. Instead, this is an epic block party where you get to meet dozens of the citizens of this small, curiously-named New England town. I guess the best way to describe it is as an edifice constructed of subplots.\n",

      "If pressed, I would have to say that top billing goes to Constance MacKenzie, a single mother and successful small-business owner who is raising her rebellious daughter Allison, while trying to keep her from making her same mistakes. Hopefully it doesn’t spoil anything to say that this mistake involved the physical act of love. Constance enters into a slow-burn courtship with Tomas Makris, the school’s new principal. An outspoken out-of-towner, Tomas is often the voice of reason. Additionally, as a man with Greek heritage, he is what passes for diversity in the otherwise all-white municipality.\n",
      "\n",
      "These three all live on the good side of town.\n",

      "On the other side, in a slum of drafty shacks, lives Allison’s best friend Selena. She is smart and beautiful and ambitious, but finds her plans thwarted by an abusive and lecherous stepfather. Selena’s response to her stepfather’s advances, and the long-term consequences that follow, comprise one of the biggest and longest running threads in the book.\n",

      "\n",
      "Many of Metalious’s characters initially present as archetypes. Her gift is in giving them multiple dimensions. I think it is a testament to her talent that – with the exception of Doc Swain, with his flexible ethics – there isn’t a single person in that I totally and thoroughly liked. Everyone is flawed, or damaged, or somehow twisted by life. Some are able to overcome this. Others are not.\n",

I felt like I could walk around it, past the squalid shacks, or Doc Swain’s hospital, or Constance’s dress shop, or the five-and-ten. I could close my eyes and see the two church steeples bookending the town’s outer limits. Metalious is precise with her descriptions of geography and weather, and uses those factors as additional characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "***\n",
      "\n",
      "Metalious’s prose is seldom subtle – especially not her sultry depictions of an Indian summer – but it is effective. Her ability to create an effective set piece – such as a mini-arc featuring all the town’s drunks holed up in the same cellar – is really quite astonishing. About halfway through, I realized that while the book was oversold in terms of outrageousness, it has been grossly undersold in terms of literary merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just recently, I finished , a so-called “forgotten classic” that features a cycle of vignettes regarding the citizens of the eponymous town. While struggles and strains for a profundity it never comes close to achieving, Metalious effortlessly mines far deeper human insights while also being incredibly entertaining. Alas, because of that entertainment value, ’s reputation is not nearly as lofty as it deserves.\n",

Over the course of that extremely long day, I finished the entire book, which is something I seldom do. It was a strange kind of blessing, being able to slip into the lives of these people, all of them alternately broken and hopeful, far-seeing and blind. The old cliché of fiction as an escape from reality never felt so true. became an immersive escape. I wouldn’t want to live there, but it was a hell of a place to visit.\n",

I was very involved with each of the main characters' lives and goings on and that's just what this book is. We observe the lives of a cast of characters of a small New England town (Peyton Place) There are MANY very serious issues that are dealt with in this book - rape, unwed pregnancies, yet it is never written in a sordid fashion. In addition, the character development is outstanding.\n",

I was expecting something lurid a la Jacqueline Susann, but this is actually more like a New England-y version of To Kill a Mockingbird -- class conflict, racism, and closely-kept secrets in a small town. The other closest comparison would be to Stephen King, in that Peyton Place features an enormous cast of very New England-y characters, as well as many digressions into their thoughts and plans, no matter how unflattering some of these may be.\n",

In this way, I feel like it's a similar book to in that the title has become a shorthand for people who haven't read it to refer to something that the book is . Lolita isn't a youthful seductress; what Nabokov puts across again and again in his prose is that she's a . Similarly here, we get actually a pretty well-rounded spectrum of (hetero)sexuality, from abuse and rape to positive, woman-friendly sex. If you're looking for lesbian incest and nuns being gang-raped, don't read (instead read Jacqueline Susann's , in which all of the above and way, more occur).\n",

      "Another random discount bookstore find. I knew nothing about this author or this book before reading, and I was pleasantly surprised. This book is a literary MONSTER (have a dictionary on hand), the text is incredibly dense, cumbersome, and yet beautiful in a way that seems to be rare these days. There are some truly touching scenes. The author's description of a night-time sexual encounter in the midst of a summer thunderstorm is covered with a dreamy realism, like the way things look different in the dark, even though you know exactly what they are, and as you read this passage, you can almost see the play of shadows under the flashes of lightning. Having seen enough Perry Mason and Court TV, I was able to keep pace with most of the legal discussions, of which there are many. What I like about the portrayal of the main character is how it suggests that we can go through the routines of our mundane daily lives and appear unaffected on the outside, while inside we can be judging our past actions, our values and questioning the whole purpose of our existence.\n",

The sections where something was actually happening were not bad but the conversations between characters were endless, the lengthy description mostly egregious and by the end, the serious questions raised by the tale had been beaten to death.

      "The comparison of this novel to Peyton Place in another review is misleading. Though By Love Possessed was a bestseller, it is a literary novel and a good one. The many plot threads running through the novel include a past episode of adultery, an alleged rape, and financial irregularities at the protagonist’s law firm. The setting is a small town in the Northeast and the main characters are middle or upper middle class. The philosophical discussions in the book go on too long but I found them interesting. More prominent 1950s authors, such as Saul Bellow and Norman Mailer, filtered their portraits of Americans through such influences as Dostoyevsky and French existential philosophy. Cozzens is giving us a clearer account of how average Americans thought and lived at the time. Cozzens deals with diversity in religion, sexual preference, and race with what were considered tolerant, liberal viewpoints in the 1950s. The protagonist, Arthur Winner, makes a well-meaning effort to treat everyone with respect and fairness but his prejudices are still in evidence. The style is awkward because Cozzens is more concerned with message. He wants the reader to get his point exactly. Once I had read about fifty pages, I found the novel to be engrossing. There’s always a lot going on. Many problems, large and small, come up and I was anxious to learn the resolutions. The characterization is good. Overall, it’s one of the better American novels from the time period. I recommend it especially for its clear-eyed picture of American life in the 1950s.\n",

I was fortunate enough to encounter it before reading Dwight MacDonald's hilarious and devastating takedown from early 1958: a fusillade of mockery which is said to have twilighted Cozzens's career as a novelist. Or perhaps I might have enjoyed it more if I'd read MacDonald first?\n",
      "\n",
      "The novel is just too long and too awful. The prose is convoluted and pretentious without really having the spark of idiosyncratic style that makes one get through, say, Faulkner or James. Cozzens, I suppose, wanted to be Faulkner AND James, but with a setting and a web of subplots that are like second-rate John O'Hara. We have an old lawyer and he thinks and remembers and broods, and talks to other lawyers, and so relives legal cases and scandals and love affairs, the import of which are so buried beneath clotted prose and twisted timelines, it's difficult to work up any sympathy for the protagonist. And then there are those weird side-trips on the subject of Catholicism, digressions that have little to do with the plot, or plots.\n",
      "\n",

Of course, I wouldn't rate or review a book on the basis of that kind of reading (except to say, in this case, that the title is misleading --it sounds like a trashy romance, but the \"love\" referred to is for family, friends, and community); but I recently decided that if the purpose of these shelves is to give a fairly complete picture of my reading over my lifetime, I ought to at least list the ones that I can remember.\n",

      "Anatomy of a Murder is one of the bestsellers of American mystery fiction. No one thinks of John D. Voelker (aka Robert Traver, his pen name) as in the same class as the elite mystery/noir writers such as Thompson, Chandler, Hammett or Cain, but this is still so good. I will also re-view the much-awarded film adaptation by Otto Preminger, with Jimmy Stewart, which I also love (here’s a trailer):\n",

      "We know from the first that there was a murder, and we know who did it right from the first, so most of this is courtroom drama, but written as a former DA who knows the terrain. Go ahead name your fave courtroom dramas: To Kill a Mockingbird, Compulsion, The Verdict; oh there's too many good ones to name! The murder is committed by a veteran who found his wife had been raped by a local bartender. Everyone saw him do it. This happens in the U.P. (the upper peninsula of the state of Michigan, an area I know very well), and the judge has to warn the jury and the courtroom that if someone rapes your wife you can not take matters in your own hands and kill the rapist. No vigilante justice in the wild wild west territory of Michigan, nossir.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, as with some of his other books, this novel was developed based on true crime with which the author was familiar. He was a District Attorney and had experience as defense counsel, too. In 1952 Voelker was asked to defend Army Lt. Coleman Peterson, who was accused of the murder of Mike Chenoweth, owner of the Lumberjack Tavern in Big Bay. After a six-day trial the jury returned a verdict of not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. Voelker, putting on his author disguise, took a few years to write the novel, which was rejected by several publishers, though the one that took in 1956 was heavily involved in making the trial the centerpiece of the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three days after he got the contract, Gov. G. Mennen Williams asked him to serve on the Michigan Supreme Court, so 1956 was a pretty good year for Voelker, who was also famous in the U.P. for fly-fishing and drinking (one personal connection; my mentor was his friend and did his share of drinking and fishing with him; I heard some of the stories). And legal opinion writing foe the supreme court, though he retired to write and fish, finally.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really liked the trial, which has great battles between the two main attorneys, the prosecuting attorney-hired gun from LOWER Michigan, who takes some shots as a snob by the UP-defender Traver, though he also makes fun of some of the small town no-nonsense life “up there”. One quick bit of comic relief is the trial of an alcoholic who steals a case of whiskey and admits it right from the first; he just wants to plead guilty and go to jail, so shut up, judge! This is a very entertaining book (and movie--with Jimmy Stewart!).\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I can't believe I've never seen this book's movie; I love James Stewart. But at least this way I had no idea what was going to happen next in the book; that was nice. And, funnily enough, I still had the odd little perk of being able to hear Jimmy's voice in my head for a lot of the lines. (Oh, and Lee Remick is perfect as Laura Manion.) I have a *cough* irresistible impulse to rent the movie. Soon. (Actually, the dvd might be in my mailbox now; I just can't get to it because of ALL THE SNOW.)\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a book that requires the right mindset. 21st century feminist prickliness has to be firmly suppressed; all the tv and movie images of young and zealous lawyers working flat out eighteen hours a day to get their clients acquitted have to be put aside. The other images from popular media, though, the ones of lawyers seizing on any slender possibility that could remotely work in their favor? Those can stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, no, the second par of that's not fair; once it gets going, everyone begins putting in those eighteen-+-hour days and falling asleep at their desks. It's only in the very beginning that the main character keeps sloping off to go fishing.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of which is to say this isn't a terrifically fun book. It had to be made into a movie; every page screams it. It is so very late 50's, from the dialogue pattering as easy and funny and sharp as a Gene Kelly – Donald O'Connor dance routine, to Laura Manion's tight sweaters, to the big old chrome-and-fins cars you just know everyone's driving. And, of course, former DA Paul Biegler (Jimmy Stewart) (well, not in the book, except in my head) said it himself: \"The case has everything. Rape, murder. Even a little dog.\" It's a fictionalized account of an actual trial, \"written by Michigan Supreme Court Justice John D. Voelker under the pen name Robert Traver. Voelker based the novel on a 1952 murder case in which he was the defense attorney.\" (< Wikipedia)\n",
      "\n",
      "It looks so simple at the beginning: When his wife Laura woke him up and to tell him she had been beaten and raped, Army Lieutenant Frederick Manion picked up his loaded Luger went out and shot the man she said did it, bartender Barney Quill. It's pretty straightforward; Laura has been and continues to be courageously open about the assault, and her husband (Manny) quite matter-of-fact about the shooting. The underlying idea is Problem is, while perfectly human and understandable, it was still murder, and Manny's been in jail ever since, trial pending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former DA Paul Biegler is pulled away from his fishing to consider taking the case for the defense. He needs a case; he's not the only defense attorney in his small Michigan town, and the other one's flashier; his secretary, Maida (the perfect 50's secretary, sassy and efficient both), would like to be paid her salary, thank you. So he puts down his fishing rod and goes to the jail, and finds it a tough call: the Manions have no money. And it seems like it could be a tough sell: Laura is very frank (too frank) about Manny's jealousy, and however much empathy there can be for a man going after someone who raped his wife, within the strict letter of the law it simply was not justifiable homicide. It was revenge. Unless… Biegler's got a few tricks up his sleeve, and his old buddy Parnell has more up both of his, and between them – and some surprising items turned up as they look into the details of the case – they're ready to put up a fight to get the Lieutenant free.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tend to doubt very many writers nowadays would quite have the gall to use phrases like Traver does. A \"blouseful\" indeed. And the handling of the rape and the discussion of it is … interesting, a blend of euphemism and clinical directness from everyone concerned, with almost no emotion whatsoever. The prosecution – trying to set the victim in as positive a light as possible – has no problem dismissing the rape as either irrelevant or imaginary, whichever's more convenient, and to tarnish her reputation in any way possible; the defense is concerned that Laura's beauty might tell against them, but otherwise is determined to stick her on the stand come what may. Her own reactions are the only real weak point of the book, perhaps excusable by the male first person point of view: clueless. I'd be curious to see a more impersonal viewpoint of Laura's testimony, if such a thing were possible, because if she really did exhibit the level of sang-froid that she seems to in the book, she was a stunningly tough – or toughened – woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said – and being allowed to take off an invisible half star from the rating (so on LibraryThing it's 4.5) – I enjoyed the hell out of this book. The film version was directed and produced by Otto Preminger, but – rape aside – I could easily see this as a Capra film. The blurring of right and wrong – who's lying? And why? What exactly is the truth, and should this man be allowed out of jail? – side by side with the sort of fervent idealism Jimmy Stewart should have had a patent on … again, whoever was at the helm, it's the perfect 50's movie. In a book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because Jimmy Stewart plays our hero in the movie, there may be little doubt going in as to how the case will turn out – but it's not that simple. It's a pitched battle, this trial, a bare-knuckle no-holds-barred brawl in which just about anything goes as long as you word it right. I've never seen or read a better revelation of the nuts and bolts of the US trial system – the mechanics of getting people to say – on and off the stand – what you as either the defense or the prosecutor need them to say, without letting out details that tip things to the other side. The head-to-head expert witnesses, the careful manipulation of the witnesses and the jury, the role of the judge and the use and formation of precedent – so that's what draws some people to the law. It has to be exhilarating. And it all comes down to a nail-biter, complete with a last-minute curveball and an epilogue that will leave you blinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Characterization is vivid and colorful - and so is the setting. Dialogue is natural; supernatural, actually, in its wittiness and quickness - this is the way I wish I could talk (except less chauvinistic). And the story is gripping. It's terrific.\n",
      "\n",
      "Side note: I find this other comment from the Wikipedia entry for the movie nauseatingly unsettling: \"The Lumberjack Tavern is still in existence today. The murder scene body outline is still there, although it is possibly a restoration and not the original outline.\" There's a picture, captioned \"where the body fell\":\n",

      "In my opinion the 1958 fictionalized true-crime story ANATOMY OF A MURDER is a good book that made a near-great movie. (Note that the publisher even issued a later paperback edition with a movie-poster reproduction as its cover.) Travers wrote this book meticulously, but practically all the plot incident wound up in Otto Preminger's equally meticulous 1959 movie with its never before, never again cast (including Jimmy Stewart, Arthur O'Connell, Lee Remick, Ben Gazarra and Eve Arden).\n",
      "\n",

Σίγουρα το βιβλίο είναι μεγάλο σε μέγεθος και υπάρχει μια κάποια πολυλογία, ο συγγραφέας εννοείται πως είναι λάτρης της λεπτομέρειας όσον αφορά το αντικείμενό του και προσπάθησε (και οφείλω να πω ότι κατάφερε απόλυτα) να αποδώσει όσο πιο ρεαλιστικά και σφαιρικά γινόταν μια κλασική υπόθεση φόνου και την μετέπειτα δικαστική διαμάχη, με το βιβλίο να χωρίζεται σε δυο μέρη (\"Πριν από τη δίκη\" το πρώτο μέρος και \"Η δίκη\" το δεύτερο).\n",

      "A woman is raped at the gates of her neighborhood, but her cries for help register too late. By the time her husband, one Lieutenant Frederic Manion of the US Army, realizes what has transpired, the rapist has fled for the safety of the local bar...a bar which he owns. Undeterred, the Lieutenant enters the bar, calmly empties his Luger pistol into the man's chest, and leaves to deliver himself into the hands of the closest deputy-sheriff. Paul Biegler is a former prosecuting attorney with congressional ambitions and a struggling practice. While Biegler is a potent lawyer, a more bombastic rival in town attracts most of the criminal defense work. A call from Manion seems like a dread godsend: while a victory could establish and spread his reputation, a defeat might make him a laughingstock. The prosecuting attorney is a man who has already defeated Biegler once at the polls, and who has an eye on the same congressional seat as Biegler. This seems like a simple case: a decorated war hero killed the man who raped his wife. But it isn't enough that a jury might sympathize with Manion morally: how can he be defended legally?\n",
      "\n",
      "The American Bar Association includes the dramatization of this book on their list of \"25 Greatest Legal Movies\", and that list drew my attention to the book in the first place. While I've been reading legal thrillers by John Grisham for the last fifteen years, I'd never heard of this 1950s-era novel. Despite the dramatic start, Anatomy isn't a 'thriller'; it strikes me as a more mature novel. The author was a practicing attorney and a judge, and wrote the novel based on one of his own cases. The judge's lifetime of of experience is on full display here, talking with the reader through Biegler's conversations with Manion and others about the nature of law itself: its uses, its shortcomings. Anatomy is thus a philosophical novel, and I for one found the musing just as provocative as any nonfiction read. The trial remains an interesting mystery throughout, as there proves to be more to the story than a hotel owner deciding to attack Mrs. Manion. Traver (John D. Voelker's pen-name)'s best talent lies with dialogue. The aforementioned philosophical conversations are fascinating, of course, but the on-going banter between Biegler and his law partner never failed to delight. In short, Anatomy of a Murder is a richer legal novel than any I've read, and I wish my library carried more by the author. I also intend on watching the movie, but that's a given considering it stars James Stewart.\n",

The Senate process of advising the President on his cabinet nominees and consenting to the appointment of officers of state is never more brilliantly illuminated (in all senses of that phrase) than in this novel. Drury, who very much knew whereof he wrote, brings a harsh actinic glare to the role of personal charisma and individual power in the business of the Senate. The small, collegial nature of the Senate focuses the astounding power of the body onto a few key players: The Majority and Minority Leaders, in particular, are vitally important to any legislation or appointment passing through the body.\n",

      "Allen Drury was, for some years, the U.S. Senate correspondent for United Press International. This gave him a deep background of inside knowledge about the Senate, the Washington press corps, and the larger national and international political contexts of that day (this was published in 1959) in which they operated. And like many fiction authors before him, journalism honed his professional writing skills. In these respects, for him writing political fiction was a natural evolution; and with my budding interest in politics as a teen, I was naturally likely to read his book. (My curiosity was whetted by having seen the 1962 movie adaptation, starring Walter Pidgeon and Henry Fonda, on TV --the book, of course, proved to be considerably deeper and more substantial than the film, and the latter simplifies a great deal and takes various liberties to ratchet up the drama.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike most of his press colleagues, Drury self-identified with the political Right, mostly in terms of a strong anti-Communism and a preference for a hawkish foreign policy based on a Cold War perception of the Soviet Union as existential menace to humanity and the U.S. as the natural guarantor of the world's freedom and justice. (Today, he would be identified as a neoconservative.) This outlook constitutes the basic message of the book, and grows organically out of the Senate-centered plot, with a president nominating a liberal intellectual perceived as favoring appeasement of the Soviets for Secretary of State, and the Senate having to vote on his confirmation. But the novel succeeds as fiction because here Drury doesn't allow the message to take over and replace the story; his primary focus is on the characters and their relationships, and the study of the dynamics of political decision-making. He lets his viewpoint be a seasoning for an artistic confection, not an in-your-face obsession that would turn the book into a tract; and the characters on all sides of the issues are realistic, flesh-and-blood humans, not political cartoons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The novel is divided into four major parts (\"books\"), each with a different Senator as viewpoint character (and a short final section that's a sort of epilogue). All of these men (the Senate of that day was still almost exclusively a boy's club), and the secondary cast as well, are excellently drawn --some are more likeable than others (Orrin Knox was the one I liked best, and could identify with to a degree), but all have foibles. Drury's portrayal of the culture of the 1950s Senate, the political climate of the Cold War, and the kinds of political intrigue that operate when principles are intermixed with personal ambition and self-interest, strike me as spot-on. (So does his unflattering portrayal of the press corps, which was already shaping up as an ideologically monolithic propaganda machine.) Some aspects are dated: for instance, Democrats with a position like Drury's on foreign policy would no longer be largely represented in the Senate (the terms \"Democrat\" and \"Republican\" aren't used in the book, but the two parties are still clearly identifiable), nor would we find Dixiecrats, like Seab Cooley, from the Jim Crow South there today. But for the time that the book was written, it's realistic. The author writes well, and crafts a genuinely involving story. He earned his Pulitzer Prize (at a time when it still meant something).\n",
      "\n",
      "Goodreads lists this as #1 in an Advise and Consent series. I'm not sure Drury actually named the series as such, but he did write some five sequels over a period of 16 years, all of which I've read and most of which I've rated at one star. They suffer, for one thing, from the fact that they all supposedly take place within a period of about two or three years of each other; but during the long real time of the writing, U.S. political culture changed epochally, and it's not possible to see the later books as really part of a consistent setting with the earlier ones. Also, they move away from the central focus on the Senate, the realm Drury knew first-hand and was most at home in describing, to arenas he knew less well and captures less plausibly. But they suffer most from a steadily decreasing literary quality, and a steadily rising inverse increase in ideological stridency and loss of temperance and nuance, with the characters becoming caricatures and the plots being subsumed by message-driven tracts. IMO, it's a pity the author attempted to write sequels, rather than quitting while he was ahead. (Riffing on the title here and one of the later ones, a high school classmate of mine observed that someone should tell Drury \"Cease and Desist,\" which I thought wasn't a bad idea.) But this first novel remains a worthy achievement that I'd recommend.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "One of the burdens of My Big Fat Reading Project (see the Writing page on my profile) is slogging my way through long tomes like Advise and Consent. It was the #4 bestseller in 1959 and went on to be the #1 bestseller and Pulitzer Prize winner in 1960. The New York Times Book Review stated, \"Advise and Consent will stand as one of the finest and most gripping political novels of our era...\" The book stayed on that paper's bestseller list for over 100 weeks!\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the story of a fictional American President's attempt to put a new Secretary of State into his cabinet, an action which requires confirmation by the Senate. Robert Leffingwell, the nominee, is seen as an appeaser of Communist Russia by the more conservative senators but is a darling of the liberals. The fight to get Leffingwell confirmed is down and dirty, ruining lives and causing great upheaval in the Senate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, though I was being taught the forms of United States government in high school during the same time the book was popular, not much of it stayed with me. I had to do a quick review of Congressional terminology and positions, but once I got a grip on ranks such as Majority Leader, President of the Senate, Senior Senator, etc, the characters and their battles came alive. Reading the book then became an education in how the Senate works; its relationship to the Presidency, the media, and the voters back home; as well as the daily life of a Senator. (You could not pay me enough to be a Senator and I was confirmed in my belief that democracy in practice differs widely from its high flown ideals.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Advise and Consent is not the pageturner its fans claim it to be, but it is a dramatic story still read today and is considered to have started a genre: political novels set in Washington, DC. Allen Drury, who started his professional life as a US Senate correspondent for United Press International, became a ponderous fiction author. His attention to detail drove me to distraction, his characterizations are complex but artless, and he repeats himself. Compared to a civics textbook however, the book is wildly exciting and humanized the Congressional men and women we hear about in the news.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am glad I read it. The novel did more to explain the 1950s and 1960s American views on communism that almost anything else I have read so far.\n",
      "Review 5\n",
      "==============\n",
      "I read this book one other time, many decades ago, probably in high school or when I was in the Navy. All I remembered about it was that I had read it once, and that it was a political novel about a Senate confirmation battle in Washington, which could be guessed from the title. Well, I read it again and enjoyed it thoroughly. The novel was originally published in 1959 and won the Pulitzer in 1960. Drury does a masterful job of writing a novel about post-war America with a complete fictional cast of characters, and he really does capture a number of timeless elements about representative democracy. The only part that clanked was his treatment of the race to the moon, which was understandable because that part was still a decade in the future when he wrote. His treatment of that was really off. The rest of it was gripping.\n",

      "\n",
      "Drury practically invented the Washington, DC, political novel genre, though thankfully his successors have not written in such wordy and dense prose. adds the United Nations to the mix and, as foreshadowed by the title, has racism as the underlying theme, making it a timely read. It is set during a year when Civil Rights was a contentious issue in America and when many African nations were seeking independence from colonial masters.\n",

      "Since you might decide to read the book, I don't want to waste your time with a wordy and dense review. Believe me, you will need that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of note to me was the tension Drury built between individuals who believed that change takes time and is best done within the systems of government as opposed to those who advocated force and violence to either achieve change or prevent it. One of the moderate characters is a Black member of the House of Representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was also interested in the author's portrayal of the United Nations. That made me want to learn more about both its history and current state. Any suggestions for good books, non-fiction or novels, about the UN would be welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "One other thing: both of Drury's novels were written a few years before their timescapes, so all the characters are fictional, including the POTUS. I find that somewhat disorienting and have to make myself stop trying to relate the novels to actual historical events. It is eerie though how prescient he was.\n",

      "In 1962 I was beginning my sophomore year in high school. Though I was mostly interested in boys, it was a time when I began to be aware of political issues, especially Civil Rights. Reading books from the 1960s that deal with what was going on, particularly behind the scenes in government, is compelling and is also filling in gaps for me, showing me the issues that have loomed so large in my adult life.\n",

It's interesting to read these books that were written in the 50's and 60's, during the cold war, desegregation, assassination, etc. They're written with kind of a \"what if\" viewpoint, but I'm reading them a good 50 years later, knowing full well what that \"what if\" turned into. Fascinating!\n",

      "So this is definitely not one for the faint of heart as it's a book about geopolitics and race relations set in the late '60's and written in 1962, and it only follows about 2-3 weeks of time over it's dense 800 pages. I picked it up out of an inherited bunch of paperbacks and didn't realize the commitment I had made till was into it a bit, but I'm glad I did so. The multiple overlapping stories about school desegregation, colonialism in Africa, numerous politicians destinies and hopes are all fictional but Drury was building off where we were in 1962 in terms of our race with the Soviets, our fractioning on civil rights, and the beginning of true world governance as the UN is the prime focal point here. The reader definitely has to have some interest in pages and pages of thoughts and dialogue about how countries feel toward each other and how politicians are always trying to balance things, but for the political history buff, it's a good fictional read.\n",

      "This book is not only well written, but is an important commentary on the state of the nation in 1962. The Cuban Missile Crisis proved the metal of President Kennedy despite the detractors that felt he was soft on Russian excursions. The right wing seems to insist that Democratic presidents are weak on defense and yet President Wilson managed WW1, FDR was a powerful figure in the defense of the nation in WW2, and President Truman made the tough decision, right or wrong, to drop the bombs that ended WW2. I believe that the current president proved his ability to make tough decisions when he gave the order to shoot the Somalian pirates and when he made the decision for the excursion into Pakistan to get Osama Bin Laden. We are all vulnerable to extremists domestic and foreign. The president is elected by the people and any time any faction decides to circumvent the constitution for political reasons we are in danger of never regaining what so many have fought so hard to protect. Our national fears show up in our literature and are as important, in my opinion more important, to understanding our past as nonfiction historical books. Highly Recommended!!

      "==============\n",
      "All literature is significantly affected by the socio-cultural and political context it's written in, and that's particularly true for fiction set in a political milieu, like this novel, published in 1962. The atom bomb had been unleashed on the world less than 20 years earlier; the Cold War was in full swing, with two nuclear-armed superpowers confronting each other like scorpions in a bottle. As a kid growing up in that time (I was born in 1952), the very real possibility of sudden nuclear annihilation was a genuine constant backdrop of anxiety in my mind, and most other people's. But while that probably played a big role in convincing me, and many other folks, that the whole idea of deploying WMDs for any reason is completely immoral, for many other people in that era, the Communist menace was seen as an existential threat to humanity qualitatively totally different from anything ever posed before, so that combatting it justified the complete jettisoning of any previous standard of ethics or prudence. Many of the same people regarded any Soviet statement as impossible to trust (an attitude fueled by the Soviet's own total lack of transparency and documented track record of frequent duplicity). As a response to this supposed unique existential threat, in less than 20 years, the traditional American unwillingness to maintain a huge standing military in peacetime had given way to practical universal acceptance of vast standing armed forces and a \"military-industrial complex\" (President Eisenhower's words) as the new normal. All of these trends form the backdrop that informed the imagining and writing of this novel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Set mostly in and around Washington, DC (with a few side trips to other locales) the action unfolds in the authors' near future, May 1974. Democratic President Jordan Lyman was elected in 1972, following the U.S. defeat (under a Republican administration) in a conventional war with the Soviet Union, fought in and over Iran. Most of the American people had backed his firm vow, \"we'll never yield another inch of free soil, any place, any time.\" (That would be inconceivable language from any contemporary Democratic officeholder, but in 1962 it would have had a believable Kennedy-esque ring to it.) Now, however, he's negotiated a treaty with the Soviets, Red China, and the other world nuclear powers for a phased and verified total dismantling of all nuclear arms, over a two-year period. The other signatories have all ratified it, and so has the U.S. Senate (by two votes). But it's VERY unpopular, both in the military and with the public as a whole. Now, with a scheduled military exercise approaching, an unguarded chance remark leads protagonist Marine Col. \"Jiggs\" Casey, a high-placed Pentagon officer, to suspect a plot by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to stage a military coup, replace Lyman with a military dictator, and abrogate the treaty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The substance of the book revolves around the attempts by Casey, Lyman and their allies to verify the existence of the plot and its extent, and hopefully to counter and head it off; and they don't have much time in which to work (the titular \"seven days\" is pretty much the time frame here). At 372 pages in the mass-market paperback edition, the pace is fairly quick, and the prose journalistic --the Epilogue actually is the text of a press conference. (Both Knebel and Bailey were working journalists, big-city newspaper reporters.) With its high-stakes premise and fast unfolding action, it could be characterized as a \"thriller;\" but it's important to note that it's not a violent thriller in the manner of more recent authors like Clancy and Ludlum, who may mine similar territory. We don't have gun battles or martial-arts fights here; we're more in the realm of detection than action adventure. It's more plot-driven than character-driven, though some of the characters were vivid enough to stay with me after over 50 years, and some might say that the denouement is too tidy. Bad language wasn't significant enough to bother me, and there's no explicit sex, though the authors take too cavalier an attitude towards the protagonist's marital infidelity. (I'd make the same criticism of a novel Knebel later wrote by himself, , though I've only read that one in a condensed version.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, the unfolding events of nearly 60 years can give us a different perspective on the particular scenario of events that the authors create, and present as possible. In hindsight, we can see that they were too optimistic, in one sense. Nuclear arms are still with us in 2020, more proliferated than before, and no U.S. administration, Democratic or Republican, and no other major power even now, let alone in 1974, has ever proposed that they be completely dismantled. (Iranian President Ahmadinejad, though not renowned for his moderation on most points, actually proposed the idea during his administration in an interview by magazine --which I read-- but world news media in general ignored it.) On the other hand, the authors were too pessimistic in another sense. Subsequent U.S. administrations, of both establishment parties, went on to negotiate a whole series of limitations and eventually reductions of nuclear arms; and though some U.S. generals may have been very attached to their nukes, they learned to live with these treaties without resorting to a military coup. But that particular scenario, possibly, isn't ultimately the most important take-away from the book. Neither is it a real treatment of the moral questions that surround nuclear force; those are never actually directly confronted in the book. The really significant message here is about the idea of democratic government, the rule of law under our Constitution, and why that matters. In that respect, it's as valid a message today as it was in 1962.\n",

      "Buddy Glass, el segundo de los hermanos de esa familia prodigiosa de la que Salinger escribió en varias de sus obras sin llegar a crear la gran novela americana que podrían haber protagonizado, es el narrador de estas dos historias, el alter ego del autor, el que, tal como se sugiere en el segundo de los relatos aquí incluidos, escribiera algo así como “El guardián entre el centeno” en el que un adolescente vive con dolor la muerte prematura de un hermano. Aquí también hay un hermano en el centro de ambos relatos, vivo y a punto de casarse en la primera de las historias y muerto por suicidio a los pocos años de matrimonio en la segunda (y de cuya muerte también escribió en uno de los maravillosos nueve cuentos que lleva por título “Un día perfecto para el pez plátano”).\n",

En ambos es considerado por Buddy como el gran genio de una familia que se caracteriza por la singularidad de todos sus miembros, y no solo por su trabajo como poeta sino por su propia vida, por su calidad como ser humano, por su espiritualidad, muy zen.\n",
      "El primer relato es muy ágil, con divertidos diálogos en los que Buddy tiene que oír, sin delatar su parentesco, los improperios que se vierten contra su hermano dentro de un coche abarrotado durante una bochornosa mañana festiva. Conoceremos el por qué de la ausencia del novio en las páginas del diario que encuentra su hermano en el apartamento que ambos comparten y que, de paso, nos da una idea de su complicada personalidad matizando la idea que de él nos habían transmitido previamente tanto Buddy como sus parlanchines acompañantes de coche.\n",
      "\n",
      "El segundo relato es muy diferente. Buddy, que está seleccionando poemas del hermano para su publicación, nos hace de él un retrato caótico a las maneras de un Thomas Bernhard amable, obsesionado y enamorado de su personaje. Seymour, como el protagonista más famoso de Salinger, Holden Caulfield, es un inadaptado que no soporta los convencionalismos, las hipocresías, los acuerdos a los que hay que llegar para una convivencia que acaba siendo deprimente por falsa. Un ser paradójico que parece no poder lidiar con la felicidad, que de chico descalabró a una niña por la simple razón de que verla le pareció hermosísimo, o que se creía una especie de paranoico al revés, “Sospecho que la gente conspira para hacerme feliz”.\n",

      "About five years ago I first was introduced to Daphne du Maurier's novels by a friend who loved \"Rebecca\", since then I have read fourteen of her novels and have fallen in love with her stories and have many more on my \"to read\" list. When I decided to read her again, out of the blue, I decided on \"The Glass -Blowers\", not knowing anything about the story in the least. I was happy to find it a kind of companion to my favorite book of hers, \"MaryAnne\" and both books for me are equal in their sharing my term favorites of all her stories, read thus far. Where \"MaryAnne\" comes from Daphne's grandfather, George du Maurier's mother's English roots, \"The Glass-Blowers\" comes from his father's French roots. Both are brilliantly written works of historical fiction, which I think Daphne excels more so than her other stories. There is something so personal and insightful about her ancestors in the time that they lived and Daphne bringing them to life, where you feel for them in all their happiness, misery, faults and the way they lived life. Maybe, they are favorites of mine because of the times they lived are so fascinating to me and I love to read about the past so much more then present day.\n",

Her females are not perfect but they can be quite strong and formidable in their own ways and in her family historical fiction account, the females hold their own.\n",

      "\"The Glass-Blowers\" story begins before the French Revolution and is about Mathurin and Magdaleine Busson and their family. The political events leading up to and the Revolution are seen through this provincial family and those around them. There are some scenes in Paris that are described but mostly where they live has an effect on all. This story gives you a small idea about how the unrest that comes their way in starvation, fear of troubled mobs coming their way, accusations and guilt without trial and horrific murders of the accused. This story is not all about the Revolution but of a family that lived during those times and it had a huge impact on their lives. Even though Margret Mitchell's \"Gone with the Wind\" is very different, I had the same reaction when reading that as this story, in that my eyes were open more to the horrors that war and conflict has an effect on those immediately around it. As the wounded in \"Gone with the Wind\" were described and pitied, \"The Glass-Blowers\" scene where the wounded are dying in their house was enough to know both sides suffered and some paid with it in their lives.\n",

She tells him about her parents and the siblings that needed to live near a forest so that the fuel for the glass works to be created. My favorite character was Magdaleine who was such a strong and loving mother who had a way to see clearly. Robert, the dreamer; Pierre, the peacemaker; Michel, the staunch ideologue; Edme; the radical and Sophie; the glue that tries to keep them together. There is so much to this story about life and how you see it and the different personalities in a family that can cause many troubled relationships and how some events in life will change your life but the basic instinct in your personality will still make you, you. I will leave it at that because saying more might spoil this wonderful read for you and I rather not do that at all.\n",

      "This is not a gloomy Daphne. But I must say it was just as awesome. It is loosely based on the ancestors of the family du Maurier from France as far back as the 18th century. I would say this is a great historical novel back when Queen Marie-Antoinette was loathed by the French citizens when grain prices increased. It is a story about a family of glass blowers and all the politics that affected them like the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror to Napoleon Bonaparte's advancement. While there is a lot of history in this it is also about the family and what they went through together.\n",
      "\n",

      "I liked it most bc who would think to write about glass blowers...? (This is a profession?!) It is seeing the world unfold & turn into chaos and fear around them. The story told from the eyes of peasants instead of the usual aristocracy in every other book. VERY ORIGINAL>>>\n",
      "\n",
      "It is amazing that Maurier could trace her family heritage so far back. Wouldn't we all like to know where we came from and give those ancestors voices? I think that is why places like Mexico's Day of the Dead is important; to respect the past and remember those who have made us and their struggles.\n",

      "In The Glass-Blowers, Daphne du Maurier explores her French family background through historical fiction, much as she did for another branch of her family in Mary Anne. In this novel, the stormy backdrop is the French Revolution. Du Maurier’s forbears, the Bussons (du Maurier was later added as an affectation by one of the brothers), were a family of master craftsmen in the art of glassblowing.\n",

      "Glassblowing, of course, is an apt metaphor for the Revolution itself. “Control is of supreme importance. One false movement and the expanding glass will be shattered . . . There comes this supreme moment to the glass-blower, when he can either breathe life and form into the growing bubble slowly taking shape before his eyes, or shatter it into a thousand fragments.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Du Maurier chooses to examine the French Revolution from a slightly unusual perspective. The story of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette is peripheral. Nor is this Dickens’ depiction of oppressed Parisian peasants exacting revenge with the guillotine. In , the story takes place primarily outside Paris, in smaller towns and in the countryside. The narrator, Sophie, describes her family’s position in the glass-making business, as well as the revolutionary activities of two of her brothers and a sister. Another brother, Robert (Daphne’s future great-great grandfather), eventually flees to England to escape his creditors, earning the shameful label of , an epithet which carries overtones of treason to the Republic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other two brothers become local leaders, enjoying their elevated status in the new Republic. They decide when to loot a chateau or execute or imprison those who seem suspicious to the new regime. They experience their own misfortunes, however, in the general chaos. The depiction of the family’s encounter with the is particularly chilling. This violent side note in a country simultaneously torn by revolution and involved in a foreign war doesn’t get as much attention in the era’s history as other events. The Vendéans were an enormous mob of Royalist soldiers, peasants (including women and children), dispossessed aristocracy, and clergy that advanced from the Vendée region against the French Republic. Du Maurier describes how they occupied and looted houses during a stop in Le Mans, by that time desperate and starving, and were then repulsed by the Republican forces, in many cases annihilated down to the last man, woman, and child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Du Maurier’s viewpoint on all of these events is a personal one, giving an idea of the day-to-day existence of people trying to live what would otherwise be ordinary lives in the midst of tumultuous upheaval. In such a turbulent time, even the lives of ordinary people make compelling novels.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "Daphne du Maurier ventured into family history with Mary Anne and she did it again in this work. Whereas Mary Anne is a fictionalised account of the life of her English great-great-grandmother Mary Anne Clarke, the mistress of the Duke of York, this novel touches on the story of du Maurier's French ancestor Robert Busson, a master glass maker who emigrated to England around the time of the French Revolution in order to avoid imprisonment for debt. In England he styled himself \"du Maurier\" (after his birthplace) to foster his social pretensions within the émigré community.\n",
      "\n",
      "The narrative is in the style of a memoir, written by Robert's sister Sophie Duval for the benefit of her long-lost nephew - Robert's son - in order for him to understand the true story of his father's family. It focuses in particular on the family's experiences during the French Revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "I may well have enjoyed reading this novel much more if I had not so recently read Hilary Mantel's and Marge Piercy's , two outstanding novels dealing with the French Revolution. Du Maurier's novel suffers when compared to these works. Part of this is due to the form of the narrative. Sophie Duval recounts the family's involvement with the Revolution as something which occurred many years previously. Her account is therefore a distant memory, rather than a currently lived experience, as is the case for Mantel's and Piercy's characters. This has the effect of distancing the reader from the characters and the events they experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another problem is that the characters are flat and it was hard for me to feel much interest in or concern for their fate. In addition, the narrative lacks the wonderfully descriptive language found in novels such as and , which du Maurier uses to such great effect to evoke a sense of place. I read about the places the characters lived in and visited without ever feeling like I was right there with them. An exception to this is du Maurier's description of the Vendée uprising in 1793, the horror of which is vividly evoked.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not as if there is nothing to admire in the novel. It's interesting to see the French Revolution from the perspective of people living outside Paris, whose involvement in events is somewhat more marginal than that of the characters dealt with in Mantel's and Piercy's novels. And Mantel's prose - even without descriptive language - is elegant and clear. I don't regret reading the novel, but if anyone else had written it, it probably would have been down in 2 star territory.\n",

      "\"Somehow, we no longer seemed to preach the brotherhood of man\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In this book du Maurier recounts the tale of her forebears, the Busson family of master glass-blowers leading up to and through the French Revolution. Told through the POV of Sophie as she looks back on her life, daughter of master glass-blower Mathurin Busson and his formidable (in a good way) wife Magdaleine and her siblings Robert, Pierre, Michel and Edmé. For Robert, the eldest working his craft in the countryside is not enough and he dreams of greatness in Paris - but unable to manage his spending he always ends up in financial disaster and bankruptcy and he depends on his family to bail him out time and again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The countryside where the Busson family lives is not greatly affected by the first stirrings of the revolution in the cities, but that soon changes when Michel and Sophie's husband Francois become National Guardsman and find themselves slowly being caught up in the nationalist fervor sweeping the country. At first Sophie is horrified at the behavior of her brother and husband as they join others in sacking the manor houses and churches -\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The people were mad. They had to have a victim. No single one of them was to blame, it was like a fever sweeping them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually she too finds herself buying into the revolutionary ideals as the madness continues to grow and suspicion and rumor grip the countryside. In the end a new and \"stable\" government takes control but it is never enough. Eventually Sophie and her family are swept up in the War in the Vendée, a little known but horrific footnote in history (do go to Wik and read up on it). Once The Terror is over the Busson siblings rebuild their lives and eventually things come full circle with the return of Robert - who fled to England as an émigré to avoid the debts of his last business debacle.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this novel is a bit slower paced at times (although the scenes from the Vendée were downright unputdownable) and might not appeal to all readers, I enjoyed it a great deal. A refreshing change seeing the Revolution from the countryside - major events such as the taking of the Bastille, the Women's March on Versailles and the executions of Louis and Marie were events that happened far away. As maddening as he was in his doomed financial efforts, Robert was great fun and I loved the way the author worked in the \"birth\" of the family name in England - du Maurier. Definitely recommended for du Maurier fans or those interested in the history of the Revolution.\n",

      "The election of a new Pontiff is a supreme event that usually occurs only at rare intervals during the lifetime of those who belong(ed) to the Catholic Church. \"The Shoes of the Fisherman\" was first published in 1963 and hailed the election, as pope, of a young, formerly exiled, Russian bishop who had been appointed a cardinal by the late pope on his deathbed. Thereafter, the new pope has to do battle with his ecclesiastical enemies in the Vatican and with his former Russian jailer and torturer in the midst of the Cold War.\n",

      "This is a story worth listening to, thought I, as I had little memory of the paperback and I had not read any other work by Morris West.\n",
      "\n",
      "I still have few doubts that I would have enjoyed the story, but I simply could not cope with the narration by Peter Hosking. Hosking is a well-known Australian actor, producer, voice-over specialist and audiobook narrator. The main issue I had raised its head very early in the book, and this was his use of a \"rising tonal inflection\" during his recital of conversational dialogue. Once I heard it, of course it became all the more noticeable, and eventually I was anticipating its intrusion and decided to give the book away after an hour of listening.\n",

      "It is very rare for me to condemn any audiobook narration, particularly to the extent that I DNF the book because of it. I readily admit that it is quite possible my mental attitude last night may not have been congenial enough to tolerate this strange inflection once it became noticeable.

      "Profound on many levels, this book is amazing. Although written in 1963, it predicts a Ukrainian Pope named Kiril Lakota who suffered much under the Communist system, envisions a worldwide, peace-making role for the papacy, anticipates traveling to Marian apparition sites, and is deeply spiritual. Does this remind you of anyone? Even the name Karol Wojtyla and the Eastern-block location are eerily close. I wonder what Morris West thought when Pope John Paul II (Karol Wojtyła) became pope? I wonder if JPII ever read this book and how it might have affected him and impacted his decisions?\n",

It's one of those rich books where the characters utter these phrases of TRUTH which leave the reader stunned ... well reader anyway.

      "==============\n",
      "I have very mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it is inspiring and well written and I am glad I read it. On the other hand it has not held up well. It is obvious that the author intended it to be inspiring as well as a serious novel about the papacy and the Church. However, it was published in 1963 while John XXIII was pope. The Church and the papacy it describes is much changed so that the internal agony of the main character as well as others is pretty irrelevant. I also have to note that the subplot involving the American reporter was not only unnecessary filler at the time the book was written by an Australian author, apparently to appeal to the American audience, but comes across as sheer nonsense now.\n",
      "Review 4\n",
      "==============\n",
      "This novel begins with the current Pope dying and the selection process for the new Pope. I was familiar with this process, but had never read about it in detail, so I found the beginning informative and interesting. It is the shortest conclave in the history of the Catholic Church. The church needs not just a new leader but someone with the courage and vision to take them in new directions. The cardinals make such a choice but then they immediately start second-guessing their choice; the bureaucracy of the Church, which is huge, works against any change the new Pope initiates. But Kiril Lakota, the new Pope, takes his time, is thoughtful in his approach and begins to effect changes in the institution to make it better serve the people. Kiril is wise to the politics in the Church as well as in the world about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is very good historical fiction which is not based on the life of specific individuals or the description of specific events; instead, it is true to a general time, position and institution. While I had little knowledge on which to base my assessment, I thought the description of some of the critical players in the events as well as the Catholic Church as an institution were thoroughly researched and created real depth to the story. This was the first of a series of four books that describe the life of the Pope and the leadership within the Church. It was originally published in 1963.\n",

      "Almost every year from 1940 to 1963, there has been at least one Christian novel on the Top 10 Bestseller list. The Shoes of the Fisherman took the #1 spot in 1963. It is the story of a Pope, how he was chosen, and what he faced in trying to keep the Catholic Church relevant in the postwar, communist influenced Cold War era. Kiril Lakota, Ukrainian Russian, victim of torture in the gulags, becomes Pope Kiril I.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Author's Note in the front of the book, \"This is a book set in a fictional time, peopled with fictional characters.\" He wrote the novel in 1962. Pope John XXIII reigned from 1958 to 1963. He was known as \"The Good Pope,\" and influenced both Kennedy and Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was succeeded in 1963 by Pope Paul VI, known for his reforming of the Catholic Church to be more open to the world, to engage in dialogue with people of other religions, and to champion social justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morris West's Pope Kiril I is a fictional combination of the two and I had to marvel at the author's prescience. I remember bits of all this, especially what we called the Ecumenical movement, but what I remember most is the Time Magazine cover in 1966: black with a red border and taking up three-fourths of it in bold red letters was the question \"Is God Dead?\"\n",

My religious upbringing, rejected and revised by me years ago, left me with almost a gag reflex when anyone starts pontificating (pun intended) on how if everyone could just be brought to believe in the one Christian God, we would have peace and justice in the world.

      "\"The book was very frank about sexuality, describing some sex scenes in great detail. However, it felt more \"clinical\", like a sex ed text than erotic. \"\n",
      "\n",
      "Not to me! it was HOT and very inspirational. Masturbation, the First Time, and Girls who like other Girls, what's clinical about that? It was my favourite secret book. That is, until I found my father's The Kama Sutra / The Perfumed Garden drying in the airing cupboard after his weekly bath. (He had showers every day, but a bath on Sunday with an adult book). I read his Freemasons' book that way as well.\n",
      "Review 3\n",
      "==============\n",
      "After tearing through Mary McCarthy's The Group, I'm kinda shocked that it hasn't been inducted into the canon yet. The book is a stunning, scary look at gender relations in the 1930s, yet so searing that it's a shock to see it was written in the 1950s. Even Mad Men, written from the perspective of today's improvements, isn't as damning as McCarthy can be about the oppression of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "McCarthy gets quite a bit out of the tension between characters being comedically wrong and worryingly wrong. And that's putting it lightly; some of the dialogue can be absolutely chilling, especially the prisoners who have learned to love their prison. Each of the characters seems promising and aware of their times, until they incidentally slip into some pattern of behavior that perpetuates the oppression of women at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as those patterns of behavior, McCarthy has wonderful treatments of internal dialogues and how women at the time sort of reasoned their way through the world. More than their actions, it shows the assumptions and prejudices they worked under, and the rationalizations that justified horrible results for themselves. There's also a tremendous insecurity from the expectations of the day, primarily marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "So many of the dialogues would start with the character considering something and, like pulling on a sweater's thread, slowly unraveling what they thought they knew. Sometimes it's accurate, but most of the time you get the sense that they're just running around in circles missing some central lacuna. And so many of the dialogues pulled from the pop-psychology of the day, primarily Freud's. It's hard to imagine today how large his impact was, but at the time it rivaled Darwin's (and possibly exceeded).\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes McCarthy steps back and looks at things from an incidental character's point of view, showing how these young women are perceived—and in that perception, constrained—by men and older women. There are yet other episodes that show the fruitless of their analysis and pop-psychology by upturning one character's inferences using the experience of another. in one memorable case, she has one character remember a party that was already described matter-of-factly, except this character's rememberance is overtaken by a single, surprising urge.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was surprised by how much the novel was also focused on class: how it in some senses liberated the women of the novel to worry less about material needs, but at the same time gave them more to lose if they worked against the social order. It's hard to say whether class lended itself to more or less equitable relations—I'd guess more because these women had access to education, but it's hard to tell given the shared social background of most characters. It would certainly vary dramatically by region though, with women in East Texas not yet receiving electricity and expected to perform any number of back-breaking duties in a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's not to say that our monied characters don't have terrifying experiences of their own. The mental ward chapter was especially scary, having gone through a similar experience myself. Kay's admission is still very similar to how it's done today, and is enough to drive one to madness if they weren't already there. Public mental health care in the US is like maintaining a fire department without fire codes, and it hasn't markedly improved in the last 80 years. One's husband cannot trap you in the ward merely on his say-so, but the criteria for release are still frustratingly vague.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is in many ways a tremendously important novel to read today, even though things have certainly improved for the better. Most people today understand that it was bad for women in the past, but it's hard to imagine the ways that such oppression sustained itself. For so many historical studies of sexism and racism, it's a tempting answer to just say they were dumber back in the day; while this is somewhat true when you consider lead-poisoning and alcohol consumption of the day, it's a dangerously incomplete answer. Grappling with the particulars of how we demeaned women is gruesome but necessary so we understand that oppression doesn't come in flashing neon. It slips into your very ways of thinking, masquerading as a web of supporting assumptions that can't be eliminated until the entire system has been unmasked and hacked away.\n",

      "Yes, this book slipped away from me with absolutely nothing.... I immediately say that there by there, the girls of Vassar College in question live their dramas, successes and broken destinies... but the whole thing is written ( my personal opinion) with total emotional strangeness by McCarthy; There are so many described things and absolutely unnecessary inserts that several times I found myself turning the pages in search of structural action to the story. Is that th e problem for us 20th-century readers?\n",
      "Certainly many parts reported by McCarthy must have been quite shocking to those who found themselves reading it in 1962: explicit sex scenes, attempted rape scene, domestic violence, lesbian relationships etc... For me these parts were not very interesting, and it sad that the girls' characters were not well delineated, if not for a few of them (Kay, Norine, Priss and Pokey). I felt more comfortable and interested in reading Priss' motherhood and Kay’s unfortunate life.\n",
      "The costumes and 1935's modus vivendi are well brought back by McCarthy but at the same time creating an effect of \" too much stuffing for the meatloaf\".

Che sia un problema di noi lettori del 20 secolo? Sicuramente tante parti riportate dalla McCarthy devono essere state ben sconvolgenti a chi si è ritrovato a leggerlo nel 1962: scene di sesso esplicito, tentata violenza carnale, scene di violenza domestica estrema, relazioni lesbiche etc...... A me tutto questo non ha interessato piu' di tanto, i caratteri delle ragazze non sono stati ben delineati, se non per poche di loro (Kay, Norine, Priss e Pokey). Mi sono piu' sentita a mio agio e interessata a leggere la maternità di Priss e la vita disgraziata di Kay.\n",
      "I costumi e il modus vivendi del 1935 vengono ben riportati dalla McCarthy ma creando un effetto \" polpettone troppo infarcito\". Se poi volete farmi venire un fegato nero, leggete attentamente la vita di Harald...il marito di Kay, povera donna, il piu' gran cornuto e stronzo di tutti i libri mai letti in vita mia!! si, un libro che mi ha lasciato incavolata!!\n",

      "\n",
      "But the further into this groundbreaking novel I got, the more absorbed I became. I especially like the way The Group moved in and out of each others lives - some of the characters disappear for chapters and chapters. This very much reflects real life. Most of the women have absorbing lives, but only the most frustrating member Kay has a real career. Kay also has a real devotion to the unlovely Harald.\n",

      "The author of The Rector of Justin, Louis Auchincloss, is the last novelist of “Old Money” in America, and may be considered as the inheritor of the tradition of Henry James and Edith Wharton. He possesses neither the genius of James nor the subtlety of Wharton, but he writes with clarity, builds an exemplary novel, and—being a product of Old Money himself (of the New York variety)—explores a world he knows well with an affection tempered by understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "presents us with the life of the founder of St. Justin Martyr, a prestigious East Coast Episcopal school, a man who presides as headmaster (“rector”) for more than half a century. Because Auchincloss attended Groton School-- of Dean Acheson, Averell Harriman, Teddy Roosevelt's four sons, their cousin Franklin, and others—it is assumed the model for Rector Francis Prescott is Endicott Peabody, founder and rector of Groton for fifty-six years. (Auchincloss, however, has said that many of the biographical details—particularly Prescott's family of three daughters--were inspired by the life of Justice Learned Hand.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever the origins, Francis Prescott is a compelling portrait of a Christian Humanist in the mold of Dr. Thomas Arnold, a man who believes that great literature illuminated by firm faith--and with a little football thrown in--offers a sound basis for education. His character is presented warts and all: he is prideful, stubborn, occasionally persisting in rash decisions motivated more by personal dislike than principle. All in all, though, he is a man who strives to be good and genuinely loves his students and his school. Indeed, he loves them so blindly he comes to believe that his worldly graduates--the businessmen and lawyers who sit on Justin's board--esteem faith and literature as much as he does. At the end of the book, Prescott becomes wiser . . . and sadder.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best things about this book is glimpses it offers into a world now so far removed from us that it seems almost as fantastic as Tolkien: a world where oldsters mourn the passing of the art of “cutting someone dead” in the street, and friendships can be fashioned from a mutual love for Attic Greek and a loathing for the verses of Tennyson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the naivete of the principal narrator--an earnest young teacher preparing a Prescott biography—becomes a bit wearisome at times, Auchincloss excites his reader's interest by his sharp portrayal of outsiders, many of whom tell their own stories: the fey, expatriate old schoolmate of the rector, the scholarship student who takes the rap for his affluent friend, certain it will make his career, and the board member's son who sincerely loves literature and art and who sees how full of posture and pretense a muscular Christian Humanism can be.\n",
      "Review 2\n",
      "==============\n",
      "The American prep school experience is the subject of Louis Auchincloss’s 1965 novel The Rector of Justin. The eponymous rector founds a school to produce an end product of comprehensible human import: young men of character who understand certain values like responsibility, discernment, and integrity. He fails utterly because, well, times were changing. The emerging corporate world did not need character, it needed high expectations which can be ’sold’ as valuable in themselves to others in order to both motivate and enrich. Auchincloss knew that the world he had been brought up in was dying. And he saw the implications for the future, not just for education but for what we casually call civilisation.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "The correct title for this 1964 Louis Auchincloss novel is indeed THE RECTOR OF JUSTIN, though some listings, through some kind of ecclesial muddle, would have it \"Vicar,\" which is wrong. Some people draw easy analogies between the novels of Louis Auchincloss and his generational forebear, J.P. Marquand, but I think that's misleading: while both plumbed the northeastern upper middle class, Marquand was given to genre novels (think of the \"Mr. Moto\" series), some longer, quite thoughtful novels, and of course the flashfire fame of his 1937 bestseller, THE LATE GEORGE APLEY. Auchincloss's output runs more to standard-length novels that are neither chest-crushers nor movie-ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE RECTOR OF JUSTIN is a good old-fashioned novel with good old-fashioned virtues, about a boy's school headmaster who performs his duties faithfully and honorably, and generally quite successfully. As such it is neither a send-up nor a celebration, nor is it loaded with fail, abuse or extraneous political interpolation. As an author, Auchincloss was certainly familiar with satire (see his DIARY OF A YUPPIE, for example) but here he plays it straight. The qualities of dignity, stability and of course darn good writing make this a very, very good novel and for a while I thought we were going to lose it. Fortunately, it's back in print again. And despite my sedate review, it is anything but boring.\n",

      "==============\n",
      "This novel was the #6 bestseller in 1964. I had heard of the author, often written about in reverent terms, but had not ever read him. He wrote 31 novels spanning his writing career of 60 years, served as President of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and received the National Medal of Arts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because he was known for continuing the tradition of Henry James and Edith Wharton in writing about the 20th century American upper class, I was not drawn to seek him out. I must admit that his writing is good and much smoother reading than James or Wharton has been for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "would fall into the genre of boarding school fiction. A rector is a headmaster and Justin is an Episcopalian boarding school outside Boston. Francis Prescott is its founder and aging rector, fighting off retirement as the world changes around him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially the novel reveals the Rector's life story through the viewpoints of various people including his oldest friend and his rebellious daughter. Like most people, he has many sides to his personality but since he is such a personage with power over boys aged 12 to 17, as well as having a Board of Directors to appease, all of those sides get full play.\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed reading the book for the range of decades it covers. Wealth does not ensure good behavior. As the 20th century progressed the exclusivity of Justin was encroached upon by the rising middle class and the loosening morals of the times. Bad behavior is where you find it. An aging man, part authoritarian martinet, part moral fusspot, tempered somewhat by his Christian beliefs, Francis Prescott is a personification of 20th century New England and the uneasy relationship between its social classes.\n",
      "\n",

      "I was never a teacher, but I was certainly a student, as was my daughter. For me, and later for her, there were a few great teachers who stood out and made learning a desired thing for it's own sake. The dedication and passion and time expended by these educators is surely undervalued.\n",
      "Up the Down Staircase was written by one of these teachers, a novel about a young teacher in a New York City high school trying to navigate between the needs of her students and the beaurocracy of the system. Written in snippets of dialogue, notes, memos and letters, it gives the reader a real feel for what actually goes on inside the classroom, which is probably the same today as it was when this book was written in 1962. I can see why it has attained classic status.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know this is just a review, but for any teacher reading these words, thank you for doing what you do. You are much appreciated, and it must be a special feeling when you realize that you may have made even a tiny change in a student's life. And for any teacher who hasn't read this book, you should.\n",

      "\n",
      "I also recognize the lesson she learned that I have to relearn: the students know when the teacher cares. The students are starving for love and affection. For too many of the students, they have no source available. They need to know someone cares.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a teacher, it's safer and easier not to care. The students are only going to break our hearts and disappoint us, we tell ourselves. Isn't that the risk we decided to take when we entered the profession?\n",

      "Bel Kaufman was a high school teacher when she wrote Up the Down Staircase. The year was 1963. She depicts all aspects of the job—the good and the bad students as well as their parents, capable and incompetent teachers alongside the administrative school staff, the ever mounting clerical duties, the job’s highs and its lows, that which is tedious and the tremendous satisfaction felt when a young adult begins to appreciate the value of knowledge and learning. There is nothing like knowing that you have had a positive effect on a child’s life. Making a child curious, showing them how to gain knowledge and how to seek out answers to their questions is a valuable gift. It is the gift dedicated teachers give their pupils.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story takes place over one fall term in an inner city public high school short of funds. The teacher around whom the numerous characters circle is a young idealistic English teacher named Sylvia Barrett. The tale is epistolary. School memoranda, homework, essays, lesson plans, teachers’ private messages sent to each other and letters Sylvia sends to friends are cited. The letters recount the events having taken place at the school. Sylvia is also seeking another teaching position in a private institution. This correspondence is replicated too There are dialogs placed at the beginning and the end of the novel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The epistolary format sets the tone of the story. The reader hops from subject to subject, zigzagging back and forth between the many characters. There is a lot of humor. There are witty, clever lines. Look at the title. It hints at the writing in store. Much of the humor is ironical.\n",
      "\n",
      "We observe through the change in the students’ writing what they have learned and that they have matured. I find this cleverly done.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last third of the novel the plot takes a more central role. The writing style becomes conventional and less to my liking. Now a story is being told. The earlier parts have an originality the latter third lacks. The events that occur have been told in other books before.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end, I played with giving the book three rather than four stars. The story had lost its unique character; it felt ordinary. I have stuck with four because the book so well describes the reality of the life of a high school teacher and why teaching adolescents can be so rewarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbara Rosenblatt narrates the audiobook very well. Each character is given a different intonation. The intonations fit the characters perfectly. Given the large cast of characters, this is no easy task, but Rosenblatt does it with finesse. Four stars for the audio narration.\n",

      "If you were born after 1960, you are not going to really grok this book in all its fullness, but as I went to high school in the Fifties, though in a small town, it really rings a bell. From 1945 to around 1965, American city high schools often resembled Calvin Coolidge High in New York (fictional place), the site of Sylvia Barrett’s introduction to American secondary education. Though slugs, drugs and the Fugs were still some years away, the huge gap between what some distant honchos thought were the necessary elements of the curriculum and what the pupils needed could not be closed. Discipline was the major problem for harassed teachers, who dealt with it in a variety of ways. Some, like Sylvia Barrett, would deal with it by being sincere, serious, and taking the students as fellow human beings. They were the exceptions. A stifling, ridiculous bureaucracy, mountains of useless paper instructions, the vast distance between idealistic principals and cynical, underpaid teachers, lack of supplies, inappropriate books, no parental support, and the daily struggle of many kids outside school raised the bar to real education to unbelievable levels. It was a serious problem for American society and as far as I know, it has not been solved. Only the details have changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bel Kaufman, the granddaughter of Sholom Aleichem, the famous Yiddish writer (“Fiddler on the Roof” and many more), continued his tradition of writing about serious things in a humorous way. Though the days of UP THE DOWN STAIRCASE have long passed, you will definitely get a few laughs from the idiocies of the bureaucracy and the heartfelt but misspelled compositions and notes of the kids. In the tradition of the 18th century French novel “Dangerous Liaisons”, Kaufman writes the entire book in letters, in school staff notices, student assignments, suggestion box notes, and the speeches of the principal. There is no “text” as such, but the effect is cumulative, entertaining, and ultimately powerful. I can see why it became a best seller in the US back in 1964 when it first came out. I’m not sure it’s a five star book in World Literature, but from my heart it is.\n",

      "I can remember reading this thing for hours each night curled up in bed when I was 13 years old. It basically began my career in archaeology (fingers crossed for grad school apps). Based on Tel Megiddo, it tells the story of a fictional Tel from its birth to its excavation 12,000 years later. It follows the path of a single family against many gods as it tells the story of Canaanite, Hebrew, Greek, Roman, Ottoman, and Israeli civilization. While some of the material is dated, it nevertheless remains one of the most creative and well-written books I've ever had the pleasure of reading (and re-reading).\n",

      "I have mixed fond and not so fond memories about \"The Source.\" I am a huge Michener fan and have read all of his books. \"The Source\" is at the top of my Michener list along with \"The Drifters.\" I started \"The Source\" in 1974 when I was visiting Israel, the subject of the book. Part of my visit included a bus tour of Israel. I was delighted to read about a place, then reach the actual site of which Michener was writing. The problem was that, about the time I arrived in Israel, I developed a serious case of \"Nebuchadnezzar's Complaint\" (the middle eastern version of Montezuma's Revenge). There was a serious lack of toilet paper on the tour and I had to read as fast as I could to keep the supply of usable paperpack ahead of the need to make use of it in a manner not consistent with that intended by the publisher. The novel was over a thousand pages and I had to read really, really, really fast, finishing the book in about three days. I have repurchased the \"The Source\" (the original is no longer extant) and intent to reread it at a more enjoyable pace.\n",

      "\" In these centuries when G-D, through the agency of preceptors...was forging a Christian church so that it might fulfil the longing of a hungry world, He was at the same time perfecting his first religion, Judaism, so that it might stand as a permanent norm against which to judge all others. Whenever in the future some new religion strayed too far from the basic precepts of Judaism, G-D could be assured that it was in error; so in the Galilee, His ancient cauldron of faith, He spent as much time upon the old Jews, as He did upon the new Christians.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The discussion between Count Volkmar and a Jewish Rabbi in 'The Fires of Ma Couer ' illustrate how wherever Jews are, they always remember that their only true homeland is Israel, and 'The Saintly Men of Safed' explores the flowering of the spiritual life of Judaism in the town of Safed in northern Israel in the 16th Century, as well as how Safed was a town where Jews came from around Europe, to escape persecution.\n",

      "In 'Twilight of an Empire' we see even in the 19th century how the Arabs conspired with a powerful Empire to deprive the Jews of land in their own homeland, and how a young Jewish traveller from Russia comes across Jews whose ancestors always stayed in Israel throughout the Diaspora.\n",
      "There was always a significant continuous Jewish presence in that country which was never broken!

      "This was a book that helped me have a more complete view of world history and all the tensions surrounding the middle east. I read in in high school during the first gulf war. My high school was pretty substandard, it was a small town, and the students didn't care or try very hard. The school was struggling just to teach the basics. I wanted more than that and I read a lot of stuff. My mom had a subscription to Newsweek and I read it nearly cover to cover every week since I was 12. Despite all my history classes, the Newsweek articles about Middle East confrontations, and extra reading that I had done, I didn't know that that Israel had only been created as a nation in 1948 until I read James Michener's \"The Source.\"\n",

      "If you've ever held something really old in your hands and wondered, \"what was life like when this was made?\" The Source is a chance to have your musings answered. Michener weaves fiction and history together seamlessly as he intertwines a narrative of an archeological dig in the 1960s (think: Indiana Jones without the bullwhip) with the stories of the artifacts and the people who created them. He traces the history of a single town in Israel/Palestine through the ages - from man's earliest attempts to tame nature and understand the supernatural, through the evolutions of the world's greatest religions, to the contemporary struggles that mark the land. The layers of story and the intricacies of the plot make it an enjoyable read even more than once.
